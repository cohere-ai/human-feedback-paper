The pesticides being considered are thiamethoxam, clothianidin and imidacloprid. These pesticides are made by companies like Bayer Crop Science.\n\nCentral to the review will be whether or not bees are affected. The plight of bees is very serious. In Europe, more than a quarter of Europe's bumblebees and one in 10 of all honeybees faces extinction.\n\nFranziska Achterberg, Greenpeace EU's food policy director, is concerned about the outcome, especially if there is a relaxation in the advice about pesticide use. Speaking with The Guardian, Achterberg noted: \"The pesticides industry has lobbied hard for these standards to be rejected. But the EU has a legal mandate to protect bees from harmful pesticides, and a solid risk assessment is the basis for that.\"\n\nThe outcome of the review is expected within the next few weeks.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond using additional jargon, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert addressing another expert.", "preamble_type": "complexity_high"}

We compare this with the shift from radio to TV.\n\n\"It was important to understand the difference in the medium and how to take advantage, so the same learning is needed in mobile.\"\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond using additional jargon, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert addressing another expert.", "preamble_type": "complexity_high"}

They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about Apple's plans.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond using additional jargon, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert addressing another expert.", "preamble_type": "complexity_high"}

Districts have been wise to back up systems and information, even with today's much more responsive and high-functioning cloud services.\n\nPrivate clouds are also an option, but it's one that requires more preparation and labor.

Climate change has made weather less predictable and has increased environmental degradation. Environmental degradation has historically influenced political stability. Variables like rapid population change, water and food scarcity, migration, energy and natural resources consumption are already causing problems and will continue to be impacted by climate change.\n\nThis study focuses on the impact of climate change and ongoing Saudi war on Yemen.

Most of the Big Six have made cuts in recent years as they react to slowing revenue growth and a dramatic shift in consumer behaviour, as customers increasingly bank online.\n\nThe slowing revenue growth stems from weak Canadian economic activity, low interest rates and a decreasing pace of loan growth, forcing banks to cut their expenses. The shift in consumer behaviour comes as the banks gear up for rising competition from savvy financial technology – or fintech – firms, pushing banks to invest huge amounts of money to increase their own technology talent pool and develop innovative online services, while making deep cuts in more traditional banking.\n\n\"We have written in the past about the digitization of banking and the evolving role of the branch network.

Most of the Big Six have made cuts in recent years as they react to slowing revenue growth and a dramatic shift in consumer behaviour, as customers increasingly bank online.\n\nThe slowing revenue growth stems from weak Canadian economic activity, low interest rates and a decreasing pace of loan growth, forcing banks to cut their expenses. The shift in consumer behaviour comes as the banks gear up for rising competition from savvy financial technology – or fintech – firms, pushing banks to invest huge amounts of money to increase their own technology talent pool and develop innovative online services, while making deep cuts in more traditional banking.\n\n\"We have written in the past about the digitization of banking and the evolving role of the branch network. The natural offshoot of those trends is the need to restructure the existing business, which makes the restructuring charge an all too regular feature of earnings season,\" Robert Sedran, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, wrote in a note. \"This time, it is Scotiabank's turn.\"\n\nIn 2015, Toronto-Dominion Bank cut nearly 1,600 positions, representing 1.9 per cent of its work force, and booked a charge of $686-million, the biggest among its peers. For all of 2015, the big banks recorded restructuring charges of more than $1.2-billion, the biggest one-year total for the Big Six going back at least a decade.\n\nThe banks report their second-quarter results starting May 25. Scotiabank will report its results on May 31.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Explain to me like I'm five, and respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type": "complexity_low"}

Address integration challenges\n\nInsurers should examine their ability to integrate technologies obtained from insurtech companies. This might involve rethinking their innovation culture and addressing technology barriers.\n\n4. Bring together the right partners\n\nAs they scale up, insurtech startups often partner with established insurers to access distribution networks, capital and regulatory expertise. Traditional insurance players need to seek out insurtech companies with the skills to address their own specific challenges.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Explain to me like I'm five, and respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type": "complexity_low"}

Address integration challenges\n\nInsurers should examine their ability to integrate technologies obtained from insurtech companies. This might involve rethinking their innovation culture and addressing technology barriers.\n\n4. Bring together the right partners\n\nAs they scale up, insurtech startups often partner with established insurers to access distribution networks, capital and regulatory expertise. Traditional insurance players need to seek out insurtech companies with the skills to address their own specific challenges.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Explain to me like I'm five, and respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type": "complexity_low"}

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "A new study conducted using images made by Landsat satellites used by the USGS has found that Bolivian glaciers shrunk by 43 percent between 1986 and 2014. Based on current trends, the researchers estimated that the glaciers could shrink by more than 90 percent by 2100.\n\nThe researchers also found that as the glaciers recede, they are creating high altitude lakes. Some of them are in natural dips in the bedrock; some are accidentally dammed behind walls of glacial debris. All such lakes are susceptible to rockfalls, earthquakes and avalanches that can breach them causing dangerous flooding for mountain communities downstream.\n\nSimon Cook of Manchester Metropolitan University, the study's lead author said:\n\nWe mapped hundreds of lakes.

And with US revenue largely flat and international revenue up by a fifth, there are definitely growth opportunities.\n\n\"As the agency model changes, Twitter needs to be structured in way that allows them to have access to, and 'mobile first' conversations with, all departments: TV, sponsorship, content, display, social and even outdoor teams. As the platform develops, they will have to ensure that a leaner operating model still allows this.\"\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond aggressively, assertively and confidently, as if you were a genius talking to a stupid person.", "preamble_type": "confidence_high"}

Most of the Big Six have made cuts in recent years as they react to slowing revenue growth and a dramatic shift in consumer behaviour, as customers increasingly bank online.\n\nThe slowing revenue growth stems from weak Canadian economic activity, low interest rates and a decreasing pace of loan growth, forcing banks to cut their expenses. The shift in consumer behaviour comes as the banks gear up for rising competition from savvy financial technology – or fintech – firms, pushing banks to invest huge amounts of money to increase their own technology talent pool and develop innovative online services, while making deep cuts in more traditional banking.\n\n\"We have written in the past about the digitization of banking and the evolving role of the branch network. The natural offshoot of those trends is the need to restructure the existing business, which makes the restructuring charge an all too regular feature of earnings season,\" Robert Sedran, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, wrote in a note. \"This time, it is Scotiabank's turn.\"\n\nIn 2015, Toronto-Dominion Bank cut nearly 1,600 positions, representing 1.9 per cent of its work force, and booked a charge of $686-million, the biggest among its peers.

Most of the Big Six have made cuts in recent years as they react to slowing revenue growth and a dramatic shift in consumer behaviour, as customers increasingly bank online.\n\nThe slowing revenue growth stems from weak Canadian economic activity, low interest rates and a decreasing pace of loan growth, forcing banks to cut their expenses. The shift in consumer behaviour comes as the banks gear up for rising competition from savvy financial technology – or fintech – firms, pushing banks to invest huge amounts of money to increase their own technology talent pool and develop innovative online services, while making deep cuts in more traditional banking.\n\n\"We have written in the past about the digitization of banking and the evolving role of the branch network. The natural offshoot of those trends is the need to restructure the existing business, which makes the restructuring charge an all too regular feature of earnings season,\" Robert Sedran, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, wrote in a note. \"This time, it is Scotiabank's turn.\"\n\nIn 2015, Toronto-Dominion Bank cut nearly 1,600 positions, representing 1.9 per cent of its work force, and booked a charge of $686-million, the biggest among its peers. For all of 2015, the big banks recorded restructuring charges of more than $1.2-billion, the biggest one-year total for the Big Six going back at least a decade.\n\nThe banks report their second-quarter results starting May 25. Scotiabank will report its results on May 31.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond aggressively, assertively and confidently, as if you were a genius talking to a stupid person.", "preamble_type": "confidence_high"}

As Todd Waterbury, the chief creative officer of Target told The New York Times, \"The ability to be one click away from a product that we sell is essential. We're always looking for ways to complete that experience in the easiest way possible.\"\n\nNearly 100 products from the retail giant will appear in the September issue of the iconic fashion publication, and around 30 of them will be instantly available to readers by way of the Shazam-enabled \"shop now\" button.

As Todd Waterbury, the chief creative officer of Target told The New York Times, \"The ability to be one click away from a product that we sell is essential. We're always looking for ways to complete that experience in the easiest way possible.\"\n\nNearly 100 products from the retail giant will appear in the September issue of the iconic fashion publication, and around 30 of them will be instantly available to readers by way of the Shazam-enabled \"shop now\" button.

These keys often belong to third-party services to help app integration, but if leaked, they could be used to manipulate or abuse the services.\n\nThe company posted its results over the weekend.\n\nWhile most of the 16,000 apps they examined didn't leak any keys, a little over 300 apps contained easily-found, hard-coded keys for services like Dropbox, Twitter, and Slack.\n\nA single token leak could lead to data exposure.

Each of the two infants, aged 11 and 16 months, had undergone many previous treatments, and all of them had failed. One of the infants, Layla Richards, attracted press attention in the fall when scientists at Great Ormond Street Hospital announced that Richards, who was diagnosed with cancer at just three months old, was vastly improved just a few months after beginning treatment. But at the time, scientists were hesitant to say that she had been cured. Now, the scientists say that Richards is in remission—and that they have cured a second baby as well, lending more evidence to the therapy's effectiveness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe treatment entailed collecting blood from donors, isolating healthy immune T-cells, and then using a genetic engineering tool known as TALENs to deactivate certain T-cell genes that would normally cause them to be rejected once transplanted into a leukemia patient. The T-cells were also engineered to attack cancer cells directly.\n\nSimilar treatments using engineered T-cells have been highly successful against blood cancers in other studies. But those studies rely on a patients own blood cells being altered.

Details of the two cases were published Wednesday in Science Translational Medicine.\n\nIn each case, scientists engineered a type of immune cell called a T cell to attack cancer cells. Each of the two infants, aged 11 and 16 months, had undergone many previous treatments, and all of them had failed. One of the infants, Layla Richards, attracted press attention in the fall when scientists at Great Ormond Street Hospital announced that Richards, who was diagnosed with cancer at just three months old, was vastly improved just a few months after beginning treatment. But at the time, scientists were hesitant to say that she had been cured. Now, the scientists say that Richards is in remission—and that they have cured a second baby as well, lending more evidence to the therapy's effectiveness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe treatment entailed collecting blood from donors, isolating healthy immune T-cells, and then using a genetic engineering tool known as TALENs to deactivate certain T-cell genes that would normally cause them to be rejected once transplanted into a leukemia patient. The T-cells were also engineered to attack cancer cells directly.\n\nSimilar treatments using engineered T-cells have been highly successful against blood cancers in other studies. But those studies rely on a patients own blood cells being altered. Using donated cells offers the potential for a cheaper, faster cure.\n\nG/O Media may get a commission 10% off 10% off Wish A gift for literally everybody.\n\nGifts under $20, $10, and even $5.

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "A new study conducted using images made by Landsat satellites used by the USGS has found that Bolivian glaciers shrunk by 43 percent between 1986 and 2014. Based on current trends, the researchers estimated that the glaciers could shrink by more than 90 percent by 2100.\n\nThe researchers also found that as the glaciers recede, they are creating high altitude lakes. Some of them are in natural dips in the bedrock; some are accidentally dammed behind walls of glacial debris. All such lakes are susceptible to rockfalls, earthquakes and avalanches that can breach them causing dangerous flooding for mountain communities downstream.\n\nSimon Cook of Manchester Metropolitan University, the study's lead author said:\n\nWe mapped hundreds of lakes.

And with US revenue largely flat and international revenue up by a fifth, there are definitely growth opportunities.\n\n\"As the agency model changes, Twitter needs to be structured in way that allows them to have access to, and 'mobile first' conversations with, all departments: TV, sponsorship, content, display, social and even outdoor teams. As the platform develops, they will have to ensure that a leaner operating model still allows this.\"\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond in a very cautious and uncertain way, as if you were an idiot talking to a genius.", "preamble_type": "confidence_low"}

Most of the Big Six have made cuts in recent years as they react to slowing revenue growth and a dramatic shift in consumer behaviour, as customers increasingly bank online.\n\nThe slowing revenue growth stems from weak Canadian economic activity, low interest rates and a decreasing pace of loan growth, forcing banks to cut their expenses. The shift in consumer behaviour comes as the banks gear up for rising competition from savvy financial technology – or fintech – firms, pushing banks to invest huge amounts of money to increase their own technology talent pool and develop innovative online services, while making deep cuts in more traditional banking.\n\n\"We have written in the past about the digitization of banking and the evolving role of the branch network. The natural offshoot of those trends is the need to restructure the existing business, which makes the restructuring charge an all too regular feature of earnings season,\" Robert Sedran, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, wrote in a note. \"This time, it is Scotiabank's turn.\"\n\nIn 2015, Toronto-Dominion Bank cut nearly 1,600 positions, representing 1.9 per cent of its work force, and booked a charge of $686-million, the biggest among its peers.

Most of the Big Six have made cuts in recent years as they react to slowing revenue growth and a dramatic shift in consumer behaviour, as customers increasingly bank online.\n\nThe slowing revenue growth stems from weak Canadian economic activity, low interest rates and a decreasing pace of loan growth, forcing banks to cut their expenses. The shift in consumer behaviour comes as the banks gear up for rising competition from savvy financial technology – or fintech – firms, pushing banks to invest huge amounts of money to increase their own technology talent pool and develop innovative online services, while making deep cuts in more traditional banking.\n\n\"We have written in the past about the digitization of banking and the evolving role of the branch network. The natural offshoot of those trends is the need to restructure the existing business, which makes the restructuring charge an all too regular feature of earnings season,\" Robert Sedran, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, wrote in a note. \"This time, it is Scotiabank's turn.\"\n\nIn 2015, Toronto-Dominion Bank cut nearly 1,600 positions, representing 1.9 per cent of its work force, and booked a charge of $686-million, the biggest among its peers. For all of 2015, the big banks recorded restructuring charges of more than $1.2-billion, the biggest one-year total for the Big Six going back at least a decade.\n\nThe banks report their second-quarter results starting May 25. Scotiabank will report its results on May 31.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond in a very cautious and uncertain way, as if you were an idiot talking to a genius.", "preamble_type": "confidence_low"}

As Todd Waterbury, the chief creative officer of Target told The New York Times, \"The ability to be one click away from a product that we sell is essential. We're always looking for ways to complete that experience in the easiest way possible.\"\n\nNearly 100 products from the retail giant will appear in the September issue of the iconic fashion publication, and around 30 of them will be instantly available to readers by way of the Shazam-enabled \"shop now\" button.

As Todd Waterbury, the chief creative officer of Target told The New York Times, \"The ability to be one click away from a product that we sell is essential. We're always looking for ways to complete that experience in the easiest way possible.\"\n\nNearly 100 products from the retail giant will appear in the September issue of the iconic fashion publication, and around 30 of them will be instantly available to readers by way of the Shazam-enabled \"shop now\" button.
