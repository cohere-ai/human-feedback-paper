The shuttle, which has never been reported before, will likely be a commercial vehicle from an automaker and Apple will use it to test the autonomous driving technology that it develops.\n\nFive people familiar with Apple's car project, code-named \"Titan,\" discussed with The New York Times the missteps that led the tech giant to move — at least for now — from creating a self-driving Apple car to creating technology for a car that someone else builds. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about Apple's plans.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type": "confidence_high", "model": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "response": " Apple has abandoned plans to develop a self-driving car, with CEO Tim Cook instead opting to focus on autonomous systems, according to a report in the New York Times. The move follows a series of setbacks for the company, including a fatal crash involving one of its test vehicles and criticism from safety advocates over its lack of transparency. Cook's decision to focus on autonomous systems could allow Apple to work with other automakers to develop self-driving cars, while also reducing the company's risk of failure."}

Here are some tips for playing a bard in Dungeons and Dragons:\n\n1. Choose your instrument wisely. Your instrument will determine your bardic inspiration die, which is a d6 that you can use to inspire your allies. So, if you want to be a more supportive bard, choose an instrument that gives you a higher inspiration die.\n\n2. Use your inspiration die wisely. You only get one inspiration die per day, so use it to inspire your allies when it will make the biggest difference. For example, if you're fighting a group of goblins, use your inspiration die to give your allies an extra attack when they're about to be overwhelmed.\n\n3. Use your bardic knowledge wisely. Your bardic knowledge is a pool of points that you can use to learn about a specific topic. Use it to learn about the local area, the people you're meeting, or the monsters you're fighting. This can give you an edge in battle or help you solve a puzzle.\n\n4. Use your performance skills wisely. Your performance skills are a set of abilities that you can use to entertain or influence people. Use them to entertain your allies, to charm a NPC, or to distract an enemy. Just be careful not to overuse them, or you'll risk alienating your audience.\n\n5. Be a team player. Your bardic abilities are designed to support your allies, so make sure you're working with them and not against them.

Here are some tips for properly maintaining swimming pool water chemistry:\n\n1. Test the water regularly using a test kit or test strips. This will help you to monitor the pH, chlorine, and other chemical levels in the water.\n2. Chlorinate the water regularly. Chlorination is necessary to kill bacteria and other contaminants in the water.\n3. Use a filter to remove debris and other particles from the water.\n4. Shock the water periodically. Shocking the water will help to remove any remaining contaminants and will also help to improve the clarity of the water.\n5. Maintain the proper pH level. The pH level of the water should be between 7.2 and 7.6. If the pH level is too low, the water will be acidic and can cause damage to the pool equipment. If the pH level is too high, the water will be basic and can cause skin irritation.\n6. Keep the water level at the proper level. The water level should be at the middle of the skimmer opening. If the water level is too low, the skimmer will not work properly and the pump could run dry. If the water level is too high, the water will overflow the pool and cause damage to the surrounding area.\n7. Clean the pool regularly. This includes skimming the surface of the water, vacuuming the bottom of the pool, and brushing the sides of the pool.\n8. Use a cover to protect the pool when it is not in use. This will help to keep the water clean and will also help to reduce evaporation.\n9. Maintain the pool equipment. This includes checking the pump, filter, and other equipment regularly to make sure that it is working properly. If any of the equipment is not working properly, it should be repaired or replaced as soon as possible.\n10. Keep a record of the pool's maintenance. This will help you to track the pool's chemical levels and other important information."}

The most common method for testing dog DNA is through the use of a DNA test kit, which can be purchased from a variety of companies. These test kits typically involve collecting a small sample of the dog's DNA, such as a cheek swab or blood sample, and then sending it to a laboratory for analysis.\n\nThe laboratory will then compare the dog's DNA sample to a database of known dog DNA samples to determine the dog's breed or breeds. This process can be used to identify the dog's parentage, as well as to determine if the dog is a purebred or a mixed breed.\n\nIn addition to genetic testing, other methods can be used to analyze dog parentage, such as through the use of pedigree analysis and DNA fingerprinting. Pedigree analysis involves examining the dog's family tree and looking for patterns of inheritance, while DNA fingerprinting involves analyzing the dog's DNA to create a unique profile that can be used to identify the dog.\n\nOverall, testing dog DNA and analyzing parentage is a complex process that requires a combination of genetic testing and analysis techniques. While it is not always possible to determine the exact parentage of a dog, these methods can provide valuable information about the dog's breed or breeds and can be used to identify potential health risks or inherited traits."}

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "The Chinese Bitcoin exchanges are currently working on complying with various regulations put forth by the country's central bank. But that hasn't stopped the country's firms from expanding their foothold in the blockchain driven fintech industry. Ant Financial Services Group, a financial services company affiliated to the renowned Alibaba Group has announced its investment into Mynt, a fintech company.\n\nAccording to reports, Ant Financial has invested an undisclosed amount for a substantial minority stake in the Philippines based wallet service owned and operated by Globe Telecom. The investment in a Philippines-based entity comes within months of Ant Financial's another investment in Thailand's Ascend Money whose reach extends to Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, and Vietnam.\n\nThe company also recently acquired MoneyGram, the international remittance service provider in a $880 million deal. With MoneyGram's acquisition (which is still going through the approval phase), the company is aiming to enter the financial ecosystem in the United States as well. The parent company, Alibaba also holds a significant stake in Paytm, a leading Indian wallet service provider.\n\nAnt Financial has been active in the blockchain technology sector as well. The company has been working on integrating artificial intelligence and blockchain technology into AliPay. It has already implemented distributed ledger technology into its charitable donation service allowing donors to keep track of their contributions.\n\nSuccessful integration of blockchain technology into Alipay will enable the company to extend the feature to MoneyGram and other portfolio payment services.

We're all familiar with lithium-ion batteries like those in our phones, but on a utility scale, they are simply impractical.

The first and most common is pumped storage. It works like a standard hydroelectric power plant but in reverse.

When you want to \"discharge\" the battery, you simply let the water run downhill and run the hydroelectric plant like normal.\n\nThe other main technology, and the one planned for the German project, is called a redox flow battery.

These keys often belong to third-party services to help app integration, but if leaked, they could be used to manipulate or abuse the services.\n\nThe company posted its results over the weekend.\n\nWhile most of the 16,000 apps they examined didn't leak any keys, a little over 300 apps contained easily-found, hard-coded keys for services like Dropbox, Twitter, and Slack.\n\nA single token leak could lead to data exposure.

The shuttle, which has never been reported before, will likely be a commercial vehicle from an automaker and Apple will use it to test the autonomous driving technology that it develops.\n\nFive people familiar with Apple's car project, code-named \"Titan,\" discussed with The New York Times the missteps that led the tech giant to move — at least for now — from creating a self-driving Apple car to creating technology for a car that someone else builds. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about Apple's plans.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type": "confidence_high", "model": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "response": " Apple's self-driving car project, codenamed Titan, has been scaled back from a fully-fledged vehicle to an autonomous driving system for third-party manufacturers.

The company is now focusing on autonomous systems, and has created a self-driving shuttle service to ferry employees between buildings."}

But the EU has a legal mandate to protect bees from harmful pesticides, and a solid risk assessment is the basis for that.\"\n\nThe outcome of the review is expected within the next few weeks.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type": "confidence_high", "model": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "response": " Bees in the US have been found to be facing extinction due to a common pesticide called imidacloprid, according to research by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Speaking to the Guardian, Jim Jones, the EPA's assistant administrator for chemical safety and pollution prevention said: \"This is a pretty big step forward in increasing our understanding of the potential for imidacloprid to impact colony health.\" Currently, the pesticide is banned in most parts of the European Union, but there is a possibility that the ban could be lifted."}

To read the mounts of the palm, you can follow these steps:\n\nFirst, identify the mounts on the palm. There are seven mounts in total, and they are located on the base of the fingers and the palm. The mounts are associated with different planets and elements, and they can be identified by their shape and location.\n\nNext, assess the shape and size of the mounts. The mounts can be either high or low, and their size can indicate the strength or weakness of the associated aspect. For example, a high and well-developed mount may indicate a strong personality trait, while a low and underdeveloped mount may indicate a weak trait.\n\nFinally, interpret the mounts in relation to the rest of the hand. The mounts are just one part of the palm, and they should be interpreted in relation to the overall shape and lines of the hand.

This can be done by placing a fence or a wall around the area, and then adding a gate or a door. Make sure the gate or door is locked, as you don't want Odahviing to be able to escape. Once the trap is set up, you need to wait for Odahviing to spawn. When it does, you need to lure it into the trap. This can be done by standing outside the trap and calling for Odahviing. When it comes to you, lead it into the trap. Once Odahviing is in the trap, you need to close the gate or door and lock it. Now you have trapped Odahviing."}

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "Not so long ago, Uber said it was losing $1 billion in China. But now, it seems that the transportation giant's fortunes have changed — and significantly at that. According to Zhen Liu, SVP of Strategy at Uber China, the car service will not only catch up to, but beat dominant rival Didi within the next year. \"Last year, we were only operating in eight cities and we were [at] about one percent marketshare, Liu said in an interview at Converge in Hong Kong. \"A year later, we are about one-third of the marketshare and operating in over sixty cities across China.\"\n\nThis is a bold claim given Didi's impressive hold on the Chinese market today.

I'm not 100% sure how to make a cake roll and pudding dessert, but I'll do my best to explain the general process.\n\nFirst, you'll need to make a cake roll. This is a type of cake that is baked in a thin, flat layer and then rolled up into a cylinder shape. To make a cake roll, you'll need to mix together the ingredients for a basic cake batter, such as flour, sugar, eggs, and butter. You'll also need to add some milk and vanilla extract to the batter. Once the batter is mixed, you'll need to pour it into a greased and floured baking sheet. Bake the cake in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 minutes, or until it is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\n\nOnce the cake is baked, you'll need to roll it up while it is still warm. To do this, you'll need to lay a clean kitchen towel on top of the cake and then roll it up, starting from the short end. Once the cake is rolled up, you'll need to let it cool completely.\n\nOnce the cake is cool, you'll need to make the pudding. To make the pudding, you'll need to mix together the ingredients for a basic pudding recipe, such as milk, sugar, and cornstarch. You'll also need to add some eggs and vanilla extract to the pudding. Once the pudding is mixed, you'll need to cook it on the stovetop over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens.\n\nOnce the pudding is cooked, you'll need to spread it over the cake roll. Then, you'll need to roll the cake up again, starting from the short end. Once the cake is rolled up, you'll need to let it cool completely.\n\nOnce the cake is cool, you'll need to serve it. To serve the cake, you'll need to cut it into slices and then top each slice with some whipped cream or ice cream. Enjoy!"}

You can do this by going to the small claims court in your county and filling out a form.  Once you have filed the case, you will need to serve the other party with a copy of the small claims court form.  The other party will then have the opportunity to respond to your claim.  If the other party does not respond, you will be able to get a default judgment against them.  If the other party does respond, you will need to go to a hearing where you will present your case to the judge.  The judge will then make a decision on your claim.  If the judge rules in your favor, you will be able to collect on the debt through a variety of methods, including wage garnishment, bank account garnishment, and property seizure.  I hope this helps you collect on your debt."}

While many existing automakers offer smartphone apps that enable the car to be turned off or on or locked or unlocked from a phone, those apps are designed for owners and would be unable to react if a vehicle were kept too long or to other potential issues. Volvo has also been exploring the idea of digital keys using a smartphone app but enabling short-term, non-owner vehicle use.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type": "confidence_low", "model": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "response": " Toyota has announced a collaboration with US car-sharing company Getaround.

The change will be seamless to customers, as it literally is a matter of milliseconds in processing time.\n\nIt's not clear whether Google was receiving any material benefit from the strategy — i.e. data from those non-Gmail users being used to serve more relevant ads across Google's widespread ad network. It also agreed to pay any legal costs related to the case and make a one-time payment of $2,000 to each of the class representatives.\n\nOther ad providers have not been so lucky. Yahoo was forced to settle over similar issues with its email-related ad-targeting practices, but ended up paying close to twice what Google had to in legal costs (about $4 million).\n\nGoogle declined to comment on the settlement, but offered that its efforts would result in concrete technical changes. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not respond to a request for comment as of press time.\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type": "confidence_low", "model": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "response": " Google has agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit brought against it in the US over its scanning of emails to deliver targeted ads, which some argued violated the US Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the California Information Privacy Act.

We must keep beating the mafias.\"\n\nVenezuela is in the middle of a vicious case of hyper-inflation that has seen the rate for their bolivar versus the world's global reserve currency, and the U.S. dollar, fall over 50 percent in the black market within the past month. People wait in line for hours to shop for food or use ATMs. Paying a supermarket bill without a debit or credit card can often require a backpack full of cash. Many are asked to use bank transfers instead of cash or even card payments.\n\nBitcoin trading volume all-time high\n\nDemand for Bitcoin has risen dramatically in Venezuela, as it has in India, with the amount of Bitcoin purchased on LocalBitcoins.com growing 1000 percent within the last six months, according to Coin Dance. With the bolivar losing so much value, it may be hard for Bitcoin to be purchased effectively in the region, as its price continues to move in the opposite direction.\n\nVenezuela is on a growing list of nations with national currency devaluations. The list includes China, which has seen six national devaluations in the last twelve months, Zimbabwe, Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Italy, Great Britain and Ukraine. Every weakening of a nation currency, or a cash ban by a national banking system, seems to strengthen the global demand and value for Bitcoin.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type": "confidence_low", "model": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "response": " The financial crisis in Venezuela has deepened, with the country's President, Nicolas Maduro, announcing that the 100-bolivar bill will be decommissioned, after it was found that the currency was being smuggled across the border with Colombia.

However, I must say that I am not an expert on lentil nut loafs, and I am not familiar with the specific ingredients or methods used to make them. I can only offer general guidance and suggestions based on my limited knowledge and experience.\n\nTo make a lentil nut loaf, you will need to cook lentils and nuts (such as walnuts, cashews, or almonds) in a pot of water until they are soft and tender. You can then mash them together with some seasonings and binders (such as breadcrumbs or eggs) to form a loaf. You can bake the loaf in the oven until it is cooked through and has a nice crust on top.\n\nHere are some general tips to keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to cook the lentils and nuts thoroughly, as undercooked lentils can be hard and unpleasant to eat.\n- Use a combination of different types of nuts for a more complex flavor.\n- Add some fresh herbs or spices to the mixture for extra flavor.\n- Use a binding agent (such as breadcrumbs or eggs) to hold the mixture together and give it a nice texture.\n- Bake the loaf in the oven until it is cooked through and has a nice crust on top.\n\nI hope these tips help you make a delicious lentil nut loaf.

I can give you a basic overview of how to play a warlock on World of Warcraft. However, I would recommend checking out some of the more detailed resources available online, as they will be able to provide you with more specific information about the game.\n\nIn World of Warcraft, a warlock is a powerful class that can deal a lot of damage and has a variety of crowd control abilities. They are also able to summon a demon to fight for them, which can be very useful in battle.\n\nTo play a warlock, you will need to choose a specialization, which will determine the types of abilities you have access to. The three main specializations for warlocks are Affliction, Destruction, and Demonology.\n\nAffliction warlocks focus on dealing damage over time and have a variety of spells that can slow down their enemies or make them more vulnerable to damage.\n\nDestruction warlocks focus on dealing damage in a more immediate way, with spells that can cause a lot of damage in a single hit.\n\nDemonology warlocks focus on summoning and controlling demons, which can be very powerful in battle. They also have a variety of spells that can protect themselves and their allies from damage.\n\nOnce you have chosen a specialization, you will need to create a character and choose a race. The race you choose will determine the starting zone and the basic abilities you have access to.\n\nOnce you have created your character, you will need to level up and gain experience points to unlock new abilities and talents. You can do this by killing enemies and completing quests.\n\nAs you level up, you will also need to choose a talent tree, which will determine the specific abilities you have access to. There are three talent trees for warlocks: Affliction, Destruction, and Demonology.\n\nAs you progress through the game, you will also need to learn how to use your abilities effectively and how to coordinate with your team. This will require practice and patience, but it can be a lot of fun once you get the hang of it."}

VBScript is a scripting language that is used to create web pages. It is a subset of the Visual Basic programming language and is used to add interactivity to web pages.\n\nTo program with VBScript, you need to use a text editor to write your code. You can then save your code as a .vbs file and open it in a web browser to test it.\n\nHere is a simple example of a VBScript program that displays a message box:\n\n```\nSub HelloWorld()\n  MsgBox \"Hello World!\"\nEnd Sub\n```\n\nYou can then call this subroutine from your web page by adding the following code:\n\n```\n<script>\n  Sub HelloWorld()\n    MsgBox \"Hello World!\"\n  End Sub\n</script>\n```\n\nI hope this helps you get started with VBScript programming. If you have any further questions, please let me know."}
