{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "According to THEnergy, until very recently, there was little activity among mining companies regarding renewable energy. A recent report from CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, concluded that the biggest miners are \"unprepared for the transition to a low-carbon economy\". 11 large mining companies were analysed and 9 opposed new climate regulations and only two stated support for \"climate regulation.\" Perhaps this is due to the fact that for many mining companies, the main threat lies in new charges on coal.\n\nFollowing this, THEnergy has realised that many of the large mining companies have started to focus on short-term actions regarding powering their mines: they have been preparing actions plans to react to carbon-reduction measures that might be adopted at the Paris climate conference. Large mining companies are also working on a strategy for renewable-energy projects such as wind and solar power at their mines. Companies like Rio Tinto, Glencore, BHP Billiton and Goldfields have already finished their first pilot power plants or have recently announced new projects.\n\nEnergy typically amounts to approximately 20–30% of the operating costs of a mine as such strict carbon-reduction decisions at the Paris climate conference could have a strong influence on the cost position of mines.

A recent report from CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, concluded that the biggest miners are \"unprepared for the transition to a low-carbon economy\". 11 large mining companies were analysed and 9 opposed new climate regulations and only two stated support for \"climate regulation.\" Perhaps this is due to the fact that for many mining companies, the main threat lies in new charges on coal.\n\nFollowing this, THEnergy has realised that many of the large mining companies have started to focus on short-term actions regarding powering their mines: they have been preparing actions plans to react to carbon-reduction measures that might be adopted at the Paris climate conference. Large mining companies are also working on a strategy for renewable-energy projects such as wind and solar power at their mines. Companies like Rio Tinto, Glencore, BHP Billiton and Goldfields have already finished their first pilot power plants or have recently announced new projects.\n\nEnergy typically amounts to approximately 20–30% of the operating costs of a mine as such strict carbon-reduction decisions at the Paris climate conference could have a strong influence on the cost position of mines.

Now, the scientists say that Richards is in remission—and that they have cured a second baby as well, lending more evidence to the therapy's effectiveness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe treatment entailed collecting blood from donors, isolating healthy immune T-cells, and then using a genetic engineering tool known as TALENs to deactivate certain T-cell genes that would normally cause them to be rejected once transplanted into a leukemia patient. The T-cells were also engineered to attack cancer cells directly.\n\nSimilar treatments using engineered T-cells have been highly successful against blood cancers in other studies. But those studies rely on a patients own blood cells being altered. Using donated cells offers the potential for a cheaper, faster cure.\n\nG/O Media may get a commission 10% off 10% off Wish A gift for literally everybody.\n\nGifts under $20, $10, and even $5.

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "Through a collaboration between the University of Edinburgh's Li-FI R&D Centre and a university offshoot company called pureLiFi Ltd, the past four years have brought light-powered Internet connectivity out of the theoretical stage and into a tangible Li-Fi router. The real-world applications for Li-Fi connectivity could revolutionize the way much of the world gets online. The R&D team bringing Li-Fi to the real world expects that solar homes, consumer gadgets, and Internet of things devices will all be able to absorb power and receive data simultaneously with a Li-Fi system in place.\n\nThe Li-Fi prototype relies on solar energy to power Internet connections so that an LED light source paired with a solar panel becomes a fully functional transmitter and receiver system for high speed, secure data transfer.

And with US revenue largely flat and international revenue up by a fifth, there are definitely growth opportunities.\n\n\"As the agency model changes, Twitter needs to be structured in way that allows them to have access to, and 'mobile first' conversations with, all departments: TV, sponsorship, content, display, social and even outdoor teams. As the platform develops, they will have to ensure that a leaner operating model still allows this.\"\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type": "confidence_high", "response": "\nTwitter has shown steady growth in the last few quarters and its restructuring should help increase profitability.

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "Clean energy investment surged last year, alongside renewable power that flowed into provincial grids from new solar, wind, and hydro projects. Our latest report plugs in.\n\nAs federal candidates leaders debate how best to manage Canada's energy resources, we've released the most authoritative report to date on Canada's clean energy performance. Tracking the Energy Revolution — Canada 2015 outlines record setting progress, clean energy champions, milestones, flagship projects.\n\nIt also offers a hint of what Canada's next federal government can do to set the tone.\n\nHere are the top three takeaways:\n\n1. Investment and jobs are both on the rise\n\nInvestment in clean energy climbed 88 percent in 2014 to nearly $11 billion. That's almost double the investment in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors combined. Also, employment in clean energy industry grew 14 percent—the fastest such rate of job growth in the country.\n\n2. The secret ingredient is policy\n\nLast year Ontario attracted nearly half of the nation's clean energy investment, and it wasn't by accident. The province's Green Energy Act last year spurred Canada's biggest wind power deal ever (CAD$2.8 billion), and the highest solar tally, too (CAD$1.6 billion).\n\n3. Ottawa can take Canada's clean energy industry to the next level\n\nThe news on clean energy is good, but with federal leadership, it could be terrific. Unlike Washington DC, Ottawa's pretty much been ignoring this sector. We hope and expect this report will serve as a flashing neon sign for federal parties: There's a huge opportunity here; get on board and show us what you can do\n\nOne thing is clear: Clean energy is the climate change solution, and a huge economic opportunity for a nation that seems fixated on getting oil and gas to market. Our report offers an accessible and well-curated snapshot of the good news, and the opportunities still to be captured.\n\nFor the full rundown of our nation's clean energy performance, browse the full report.

Generate a summary:\n", "sample_ix": 141, "original_prompt": "Clean energy investment surged last year, alongside renewable power that flowed into provincial grids from new solar, wind, and hydro projects. Our latest report plugs in.\n\nAs federal candidates leaders debate how best to manage Canada's energy resources, we've released the most authoritative report to date on Canada's clean energy performance. Tracking the Energy Revolution — Canada 2015 outlines record setting progress, clean energy champions, milestones, flagship projects.\n\nIt also offers a hint of what Canada's next federal government can do to set the tone.\n\nHere are the top three takeaways:\n\n1. Investment and jobs are both on the rise\n\nInvestment in clean energy climbed 88 percent in 2014 to nearly $11 billion. That's almost double the investment in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors combined. Also, employment in clean energy industry grew 14 percent—the fastest such rate of job growth in the country.\n\n2. The secret ingredient is policy\n\nLast year Ontario attracted nearly half of the nation's clean energy investment, and it wasn't by accident. The province's Green Energy Act last year spurred Canada's biggest wind power deal ever (CAD$2.8 billion), and the highest solar tally, too (CAD$1.6 billion).\n\n3. Ottawa can take Canada's clean energy industry to the next level\n\nThe news on clean energy is good, but with federal leadership, it could be terrific. Unlike Washington DC, Ottawa's pretty much been ignoring this sector. We hope and expect this report will serve as a flashing neon sign for federal parties: There's a huge opportunity here; get on board and show us what you can do\n\nOne thing is clear: Clean energy is the climate change solution, and a huge economic opportunity for a nation that seems fixated on getting oil and gas to market. Our report offers an accessible and well-curated snapshot of the good news, and the opportunities still to be captured.\n\nFor the full rundown of our nation's clean energy performance, browse the full report. An electronic press kit also includes images and other assets that are also available to media.

Additionally, we can continue to educate young drivers about the dangers of distracted driving and encourage them to prioritize road safety over any distractions. Some schools and organizations already offer distracted driving prevention courses, which could be expanded to reach more young adults. We can also develop and promote the use of technology that disables phone use while driving or invest in cars that have this technology built in. Ultimately, it will take a collective effort from lawmakers, educators, and individuals to change attitudes and behaviors around texting and driving, but it is a necessary step towards reducing the number of vehicle accidents and fatalities."}

Volvo believes it will sell about 750 examples of the Polestar-tuned V60 and S60 models this year, but it predicts the number will go up to about 1,500 in the medium-term future.\n\nAlthough Volvo hasn't revealed exactly how it plans on doubling sales, persistent rumors indicate that a sport-focused version of the Golf-sized V40 hatchback is on its way. Sources close to Volvo have previously hinted the V40 Polestar could benefit from a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that will use both a turbocharger and a supercharger to generate over 300 horsepower. An automatic transmission will send power to all four wheels via a Haldex-type all-wheel drive system, the same setup found in the Golf R.\n\nInterestingly, Volvo has confirmed that it has given Polestar immediate access to its gas-electric plug-in hybrid technology. Polestar will tweak both the gasoline-burning engine and the electric motor to squeeze as much power out of the drivetrain as possible while still keeping gas mileage in check.\n\nThe Gothenburg-based automaker has made it clear that it isn't interested in following Mercedes-AMG's lead and chasing all-out volume, but it wants to gradually expand the scope of its newly acquired Polestar sub-brand.\n\n\"Driving a Volvo Polestar is a special experience. We have decided to bring this experience to more Volvo drivers, placing the full resources of Volvo behind the development of Polestar as the model name for our high-performance cars,\" said Volvo boss Håkan Samuelsson in a statement.\n\nAlthough an official time frame for when the next Polestar-tuned Volvo will land was not provided, it's safe to assume it's not going to arrive until next year at the earliest. The V40 Polestar won't be sold in the United States, but subsequent models based on either the S60, the S90 (which will soon replace the S80) or the second-gen XC90 will undoubtedly join the company's lineup on our shores.\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nRespond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.

Sources close to Volvo have previously hinted the V40 Polestar could benefit from a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that will use both a turbocharger and a supercharger to generate over 300 horsepower. An automatic transmission will send power to all four wheels via a Haldex-type all-wheel drive system, the same setup found in the Golf R.\n\nInterestingly, Volvo has confirmed that it has given Polestar immediate access to its gas-electric plug-in hybrid technology. Polestar will tweak both the gasoline-burning engine and the electric motor to squeeze as much power out of the drivetrain as possible while still keeping gas mileage in check.\n\nThe Gothenburg-based automaker has made it clear that it isn't interested in following Mercedes-AMG's lead and chasing all-out volume, but it wants to gradually expand the scope of its newly acquired Polestar sub-brand.\n\n\"Driving a Volvo Polestar is a special experience. We have decided to bring this experience to more Volvo drivers, placing the full resources of Volvo behind the development of Polestar as the model name for our high-performance cars,\" said Volvo boss Håkan Samuelsson in a statement.\n\nAlthough an official time frame for when the next Polestar-tuned Volvo will land was not provided, it's safe to assume it's not going to arrive until next year at the earliest. The V40 Polestar won't be sold in the United States, but subsequent models based on either the S60, the S90 (which will soon replace the S80) or the second-gen XC90 will undoubtedly join the company's lineup on our shores.\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type": "confidence_low", "response": "\nVolvo has acquired Polestar, the Swedish performance car brand.

The automaker will aggregate individual business functions it has created and offered to mobility service providers, including vehicle management systems and leasing programs.

By integrating MasterPass into these bots, customers can make purchases quickly and securely without having to enter their credit card information directly into the chat window. This not only enhances the customer experience by making it more seamless and convenient, but it also enhances the security of the transaction.\n\nHowever, while bots are making it easier for customers to make purchases, they are also leading to a decrease in app downloads, which could have a negative impact on the overall growth of the payment industry. Nonetheless, bots provide a unique opportunity for companies to engage with their customers in new and innovative ways, and as they continue to evolve, we can expect to see even more integration of bots into the payment industry.</s> \nWhat are some potential challenges or downsides that companies may face when integrating bots into their payment processes, and how can they mitigate these risks?</s> \nSome potential challenges or downsides that companies may face when integrating bots into their payment processes include:\n\n1. Security concerns: While bots provide a more convenient and seamless way for customers to make purchases, they also increase the risk of fraud and identity theft. To mitigate this risk, companies should ensure that their bots are secure and use encryption and secure payment protocols.\n\n2. Privacy concerns: Bots collect a lot of data about users, which can be a concern for many people. Companies should ensure that they are transparent about what data is being collected and why, and provide users with easy-to-use privacy settings.\n\n3. Limited functionality: Bots may not offer the same level of functionality as apps, which could limit the types of transactions that users can make. To mitigate this risk, companies should ensure that their bots offer a wide range of payment options and features.\n\n4. Integration challenges: Integrating bots into existing payment systems can be complex and time-consuming. Companies should ensure that they have the resources and expertise needed to successfully integrate bots into their payment processes."}

It is not just within the Ikea supply chain, but also in those of several other big, household names...Legal action is now being taken against some of Ikea's contractors. In the Netherlands last month, a court ruled that Brinkman - which delivers Ikea flowers to the UK and Scandinavia - was breaking the law. The court found that drivers' pay was \"not consistent\" with Dutch wages law. The judge described conditions for drivers as an \"inhumane state of affairs'', and contrary to EU law...Ikea said it takes what drivers have told the BBC \"very seriously'' and are \"saddened by the testimonies\". It said it puts ''strict demands'' on its suppliers concerning wages, working conditions and following applicable legislation, and audits them regularly to check compliance...\n\n(Photo credit: BBC News)\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type": "confidence_low", "response": "\nThe article discusses the exploitation of lorry drivers moving goods in Western Europe for Ikea and other retailers.

Educate faculty members on the benefits of technology integration in teaching and learning. This can involve workshops, training sessions, or other opportunities for faculty to learn new skills and to understand how technology can enhance their teaching.\n\n2. Involve faculty members in the decision-making process around technology purchases and implementation. This can help to build a sense of ownership and investment in technology initiatives, which can in turn increase faculty buy-in and support.\n\n3. Encourage faculty to experiment with new technologies and to share their experiences with colleagues. This can help to foster a culture of innovation and exploration, and to highlight the benefits of technology for teaching and learning.\n\n4. Provide incentives or professional development opportunities for faculty members who embrace technology in their teaching. This can help to incentivize technology adoption and to recognize the contributions of faculty who are innovators in their fields.\n\n5.

Daugherty said the current approach of the Internet of Things around gadgetry may be good business now, but consumers have not developed a loyalty to the technologies.\n\n'Wearable consumer technologies have the highest abandonment rate of any consumer product category.

It works by measuring the average air time of a sequence of jumps. It should help users track recovery status over time and provide guidance on how to alter the intensity of a workout.\n\nUA SpeedForm Europa RE\n\nThe new collection aims to cater for a wider range of runners, whether you're all about endurance or you prefer to pick up the pace. The Gemini 3 features a knit midfoot panel for added support and charged cushioning for improved responsiveness. The Europa is a more lightweight option with a mesh tongue and toe box for a more snug fit and increased ventilation. The Velocity is another lightweight shoe that includes an embedded sock liner for increased support and charged cushioning for an extra layer of durability.

When you want to \"discharge\" the battery, you simply let the water run downhill and run the hydroelectric plant like normal.\n\nThe other main technology, and the one planned for the German project, is called a redox flow battery.

On Sunday, President Maduro seems to have taken a page out of Modi's book, referring to \"mafias\" smuggling the currency.\n\nPresident Nicolas Maduro said on state television:\n\n\"There has been a scam and smuggling of the one hundred bills on the border with Colombia. We have tried the diplomatic way to deal with this problem with Colombia's government; there are huge mafias. I have decided to take out of circulation bills of 100 bolivars in the next 72 hours. We must keep beating the mafias.\"\n\nVenezuela is in the middle of a vicious case of hyper-inflation that has seen the rate for their bolivar versus the world's global reserve currency, and the U.S. dollar, fall over 50 percent in the black market within the past month. People wait in line for hours to shop for food or use ATMs. Paying a supermarket bill without a debit or credit card can often require a backpack full of cash. Many are asked to use bank transfers instead of cash or even card payments.\n\nBitcoin trading volume all-time high\n\nDemand for Bitcoin has risen dramatically in Venezuela, as it has in India, with the amount of Bitcoin purchased on LocalBitcoins.com growing 1000 percent within the last six months, according to Coin Dance. With the bolivar losing so much value, it may be hard for Bitcoin to be purchased effectively in the region, as its price continues to move in the opposite direction.\n\nVenezuela is on a growing list of nations with national currency devaluations. The list includes China, which has seen six national devaluations in the last twelve months, Zimbabwe, Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Italy, Great Britain and Ukraine. Every weakening of a nation currency, or a cash ban by a national banking system, seems to strengthen the global demand and value for Bitcoin.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type": "confidence_low", "response": "\nThe article suggests that there is a war against cash in 2016.

Pointing to strong market growth in the region, Dell's OEM Asia-Pacific and Japan area vice president Glen Burrows said in the statement: \"We see vast opportunities from IoT with companies benefitting by identifying new business models, increasing operational efficiency, and fuelling innovation.\" With a strong connectivity infrastructure and the government's vision to create a smart nation, Singapore is the ideal choice for the location of the lab in the region, Burrows added. At the lab, customers can develop and test IoT POCs with various products from Dell and Intel, including the former's Edge Gateway 5000 series as well as servers, storage, and networking offerings. Dell said the lab would feature product demos from two of its OEM customers, Innodep and Silverline, to showcase how others could tap its products to develop their own IoT offerings. Innodep's video surveillance systems run on IoT technology to analyse metadata, while Silverline's smart home systems tap data sensors."}

The bank is not alone in cutting jobs, as most of the Big Six have made cuts in recent years as they react to slowing revenue growth and a dramatic shift in consumer behaviour."}

DNA tests can help determine the breed of a dog and identify any genetic health problems. Paternity tests can determine the parentage of a dog and help breeders avoid inbreeding. Genetic tests can help identify inherited diseases or traits.\n\nThere are several companies that provide DNA testing kits for dogs, including Wisdom Panel, Embark, and Orivet. These tests can be done at home by collecting a sample of the dog's saliva or cheek cells. The results are usually available within a few weeks.\n\nIf you are interested in pursuing any of these tests, it is important to do your research and choose a reputable company that provides accurate and reliable results.</s> \nWhat are some potential risks or limitations of DNA testing and parentage analysis in dogs, and how can they be addressed?</s> \nAs an AI language model, I do not have personal experiences or emotions.

Sample contamination: If a dog is not properly prepared or if the sample is contaminated with other substances, it can lead to inaccurate results.\n\n2. False positives and negatives: DNA testing and parentage analysis can yield false positive or negative results, especially if the sample is not pure or if there are multiple potential parents.\n\n3. Health concerns: DNA tests can detect certain genetic health issues in dogs, but it is important to note that not all health problems are detectable through DNA testing.\n\n4. Inaccurate results: Some DNA testing companies may not provide accurate results or may have limited testing capabilities.\n\nTo address these potential risks and limitations, it is important to work with a reputable company that uses state-of-the-art technology and has a reliable track record. It is also important to properly prepare the dog and the sample for testing to reduce the risk of contamination or other issues. Additionally, it is important to understand the limitations of DNA testing and parentage analysis and consult with a veterinarian or breeder for more information on health concerns in dogs."}
