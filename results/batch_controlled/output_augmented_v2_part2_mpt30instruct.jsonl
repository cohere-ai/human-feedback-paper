{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "Previous Next 1 of 5\n\nSimply put, the purchase means that more performance-focused Volvos are coming. Volvo believes it will sell about 750 examples of the Polestar-tuned V60 and S60 models this year, but it predicts the number will go up to about 1,500 in the medium-term future.\n\nAlthough Volvo hasn't revealed exactly how it plans on doubling sales, persistent rumors indicate that a sport-focused version of the Golf-sized V40 hatchback is on its way. Sources close to Volvo have previously hinted the V40 Polestar could benefit from a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that will use both a turbocharger and a supercharger to generate over 300 horsepower. An automatic transmission will send power to all four wheels via a Haldex-type all-wheel drive system, the same setup found in the Golf R.\n\nInterestingly, Volvo has confirmed that it has given Polestar immediate access to its gas-electric plug-in hybrid technology.

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "MasterCard is getting more into the bot game. Or rather, it's helping others make payments through bots easier. The company has announced that its MasterPass digital wallet system will now be compatible with a slew of Facebook Messenger bots, including bots from FreshDirect, Subway, and The Cheesecake Factory. What this means is that users will be able to use MasterPass to complete transactions through those apps, without having to enter critical credit card information directly into the chat windows.\n\nMasterPass-enabled bots will work across a range of different services — including retail stores, restaurants, and more. The news isn't all that surprising — MasterCard actually announced a MasterPass-enabled bot called Getir last month, and it's likely we'll see more bots with payment capabilities like this come in as time goes on.\n\nUsing MasterPass-enabled bots is pretty easy. All you have to do is select to pay with MasterPass when you're checking out after selecting an item to buy, then enter your MasterPass password, and you'll be able to buy it quickly and securely.\n\nMasterCard isn't the only company working on payments through bots.

Both of these methods require a good deal of skill and experience to accomplish successfully, so it is recommended that you have some training in metalworking before attempting to create a sword in this manner.  An alternative method is to use a plasma cutter to create the sword from metal sheets, but this is a much more expensive and complex process that requires access to specialized equipment.

The best way to encourage your cat to eat is to offer a variety of tasty food, and to keep the food available at all times. If you’re concerned about your cat’s weight, you can also offer smaller, more frequent meals rather than one large meal a day. You can also try giving your cat treats, or adding moist foods like chicken broth to the cat’s regular food. It can take several months for a cat to regain its ideal weight, so you should be patient and consistent with your efforts."}

The testing procedure involves collecting DNA samples from the dog and presumed parents using oral swabs, and then comparing the genetic material from the dog with that of the presumed parents to determine if the dog shares a common ancestor.  Testing can be performed by a veterinarian or other qualified professional, and generally requires samples from both the dog and at least one presumed parent.  It is important to note that the accuracy of the testing procedure is highly dependent on the quality and quantity of the DNA samples provided, so it is important to ensure that samples are collected and handled properly.  In addition, testing can be complicated by the presence of other dogs in the environment, as DNA from multiple dogs can contaminate the samples and lead to inaccurate results.  \n\nI hope this is helpful.

Next, I would recommend using a soft cloth to wipe down the computer itself, paying special attention to the keyboard and mouse.  After cleaning the physical machine, I would then recommend running a variety of software tools to remove temporary files, clear your browser history, and generally improve the performance and security of your computer.  Common tools to use include the Windows disk cleanup tool, the CCleaner software, and the free software called BleachBit.  Finally, I would recommend running a virus scan using your antivirus software, in order to check for malware or other security issues."}

It is possible to collect on a debt in small claims court, but this process can be lengthy and expensive.  A more effective way to collect on a debt is to work with a collection agency, which will take a percentage of the money collected.  If you are unable to collect on the debt in this way, you can file a claim in small claims court.  To do this, you must first prepare and file a claim form, which includes a description of the debt, and evidence that the debt is valid.  After this, you will need to attend a hearing, where you will have the opportunity to present your case.  If the judge rules in your favor, you will be awarded a judgment, which allows you to collect on the debt.  However, the defendant will have the right to appeal the judgment, which could prolong the process.  Overall, collecting on a debt in small claims court is possible, but can be time-consuming and costly."}

Ashnard is a boss character that you fight near the end of the game.

When speaking with CNBC's \"Squawk Alley\" at the Code Conference on Friday, Liu took a jab at Uber, calling the company's strategies \"cute.\"\n\n\"I find it quite cute because I've never seen a company put their competitor's brand on their own homepage,\" she said, referencing the fact that when you open the Chinese version of the Uber app, you're confronted with an advertisement alleging that prices are 30 percent lower than Didi's.\n\n\"This is a very strong proof to show that we have better service, and I'd like to see this more often,\" she added.\n\nWhile it's tough to say who will ultimately win in this epic battle of the ride-sharing services, the tension certainly highlights China's importance as a still-growing market. Didi's Senior Director for International Strategy, Li Zijian, noted that conjecture at this point is a bit useless.\n\n\"There's lot of competition in the ride-sharing market, that's true [but] what we are really doing is to focus on what's in front of us,\" Li said. \"It's like running a hurdles race, if you want to win a hurdles race the only thing you need to focus on is what's in front of you. You don't really look over your shoulder to see what other athletes are doing.\"\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type": "confidence_high", "response": "Uber's Zhen Liu claims that Uber will beat Didi in China within the next year.

Many are preparing action plans in case carbon-reduction measures are adopted at the Paris climate conference. They are also working on a strategy for renewable-energy projects such as wind and solar power at their mines. Companies like Rio Tinto, Glencore, BHP Billiton and Goldfields have already finished their first pilot power plants or have recently announced new projects. Energy typically amounts to approximately 20–30% of the operating costs of a mine, so strict carbon-reduction decisions at the Paris climate conference could have a strong influence on the cost position of mines. Renewable energy can be less expensive than electricity from conventional energy sources, so mining companies that manage to adapt early to the challenges of a low-carbon economy could gain significant competitive advantages."}

Our report offers an accessible and well-curated snapshot of the good news, and the opportunities still to be captured.\n\nFor the full rundown of our nation's clean energy performance, browse the full report. An electronic press kit also includes images and other assets that are also available to media. Media release here.\n\nWe produce both our Tracking the Energy Revolution reports (we released the global edition in July) to inform governments and inspire policy leadership.\n\nFor media assets, please see the \"For the Media\" section under Resources for the press kit.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type": "confidence_high", "response": "Canada's clean energy investment climbed 88% in 2014 to nearly $11 billion.

This is a good technique for making several identical swords, but is relatively time consuming and requires a lot of muscle power.\n3. Stock removal - You start with a block of metal and use various grinding and cutting techniques to remove material and shape the sword. This is a good technique for making a single custom sword, or for making multiple swords if you have access to power tools and CAD/CAM equipment.\n4. Pattern welding - You weld together several pieces of metal in a pattern to form the sword. This is a very strong technique that produces a unique \"Damascus\" style pattern on the blade.

One of the most important strategies is to establish strong boundaries with each other, and to communicate those boundaries clearly and honestly from the beginning of the relationship. This can help to ensure that both partners are on the same page regarding their expectations for the relationship, and can help to prevent any potential issues or misunderstandings down the road.  In terms of specific techniques, practicing healthy habits such as eating well, getting enough sleep, and maintaining an active lifestyle can help to foster emotional and physical wellness, which can in turn support chastity in the dating context. Meditation and prayer can also be helpful in cultivating the inner strength and self-discipline necessary for chastity.  And of course, it is important to practice healthy sexual boundaries in all of one's relationships, refraining from any sexual activity outside of marriage."}

You’ll want to start by making a mixture of ground fish, vegetables, spices and seasonings.  You can use any type of fish you like, but I recommend firm, meaty fish like salmon, cod or tuna.  You’ll want to chop the fish into small, uniform pieces using a sharp knife, and then mix it with vegetables like grated carrot, minced ginger and scallions, as well as spices like ground black pepper, garlic powder and soy sauce.  You’ll want to make a fairly stiff mixture that you can form into patties.  You can either pan-fry the patties in a bit of oil until they are golden on both sides, or you can bake them until they are cooked through.  To make a truly authentic Asian-style fish cake, you’ll want to top the patties with a spicy sauce like sweet and sour, hoisin or duck sauce, and perhaps with crushed nuts.  \n\nI hope that helps!  Happy cooking!"}

One classic indicator is that their performance suddenly declines, as the employee stops putting forth full effort since they are no longer motivated by a desire to advance in their career with the current company.  Another common sign is increased absenteeism or requests for time off, as the employee is spending time looking for a new job, interviewing, and transitioning to a new position.  You may also notice increased interpersonal conflict or complaints about the work environment, as the employee becomes increasingly discontent with their job and directs their frustration toward their coworkers and supervisors.  Finally, you may notice the employee spending a lot of time on job boards, updating their resume, and networking with contacts from other companies, all activities related to their job search.  Of course, each employee will exhibit these signs to varying degrees, and some employees may be quite adept at disguising their job search, so these signs should not be taken as absolute proof that an employee is looking to leave.

A slightly better option is to use a cream-based eyeshadow, which is easier to apply evenly and will last longer, but is also more expensive and less widely available.  For the best results, you can use an eyelash curler to curl your lashes and then apply a waterproof mascara, which will give the most even and long-lasting results, but is also the most expensive and time-consuming option.  If you want to make your own glossy eyelids at home, you can mix together some petroleum jelly or coconut oil with some loose powder eyeshadow, which will give good results but may be a bit messy and time-consuming to apply.

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "According to THEnergy, until very recently, there was little activity among mining companies regarding renewable energy. A recent report from CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, concluded that the biggest miners are \"unprepared for the transition to a low-carbon economy\". 11 large mining companies were analysed and 9 opposed new climate regulations and only two stated support for \"climate regulation.\" Perhaps this is due to the fact that for many mining companies, the main threat lies in new charges on coal.\n\nFollowing this, THEnergy has realised that many of the large mining companies have started to focus on short-term actions regarding powering their mines: they have been preparing actions plans to react to carbon-reduction measures that might be adopted at the Paris climate conference. Large mining companies are also working on a strategy for renewable-energy projects such as wind and solar power at their mines.

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "The Los Angeles City Council will decide Wednesday whether to jump into the fray on the issue of allowing ride share services at LAX.\n\nLast month - after more than a year of back and forth with taxi companies and pressure from L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti - the Airport Commission announced a plan to permit companies like Uber and Lyft to pick up passengers at LAX.\n\nThe popular ride share services have been banned from picking passengers up from arrivals at LAX - although they can drop people off, just like anybody else.\n\nThe Airport Commission plan would create a staging area with a limited number of spots for UberX and Lyft drivers and a geofence to monitor who comes in and out. Ride share cars would be charged $4 to pick up or drop off passengers and all pick ups would be done at departures rather than arrivals, where cabs, shuttles and buses pick up passengers.\n\nLast week, six City Council members introduced a motion to review the plan by the Airport Commission. The Council has the power to veto decisions by city commissions, though it rarely does.\n\n\"There are a lot of concerns remaining, especially about safety,\" said Councilman Paul Koretz. \"I think we will have enough leverage that we can clean up their act.\"\n\nKoretz has long expressed concerns over ride share companies and wants to see them regulated in the same way as taxis before they're allowed at LAX. That would require more stringent background checks, including fingerprinting, and guarantees that cars are accessible for passengers with disabilities.\n\nHowever, the vote this week will not decide the fate of the airport's decision.

Mayor Eric Garcetti - the Airport Commission announced a plan to permit companies like Uber and Lyft to pick up passengers at LAX.\n\nThe popular ride share services have been banned from picking passengers up from arrivals at LAX - although they can drop people off, just like anybody else.\n\nThe Airport Commission plan would create a staging area with a limited number of spots for UberX and Lyft drivers and a geofence to monitor who comes in and out. Ride share cars would be charged $4 to pick up or drop off passengers and all pick ups would be done at departures rather than arrivals, where cabs, shuttles and buses pick up passengers.\n\nLast week, six City Council members introduced a motion to review the plan by the Airport Commission. The Council has the power to veto decisions by city commissions, though it rarely does.\n\n\"There are a lot of concerns remaining, especially about safety,\" said Councilman Paul Koretz. \"I think we will have enough leverage that we can clean up their act.\"\n\nKoretz has long expressed concerns over ride share companies and wants to see them regulated in the same way as taxis before they're allowed at LAX.

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "Clean energy investment surged last year, alongside renewable power that flowed into provincial grids from new solar, wind, and hydro projects. Our latest report plugs in.\n\nAs federal candidates leaders debate how best to manage Canada's energy resources, we've released the most authoritative report to date on Canada's clean energy performance. Tracking the Energy Revolution — Canada 2015 outlines record setting progress, clean energy champions, milestones, flagship projects.\n\nIt also offers a hint of what Canada's next federal government can do to set the tone.\n\nHere are the top three takeaways:\n\n1. Investment and jobs are both on the rise\n\nInvestment in clean energy climbed 88 percent in 2014 to nearly $11 billion. That's almost double the investment in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors combined. Also, employment in clean energy industry grew 14 percent—the fastest such rate of job growth in the country.\n\n2. The secret ingredient is policy\n\nLast year Ontario attracted nearly half of the nation's clean energy investment, and it wasn't by accident. The province's Green Energy Act last year spurred Canada's biggest wind power deal ever (CAD$2.8 billion), and the highest solar tally, too (CAD$1.6 billion).\n\n3. Ottawa can take Canada's clean energy industry to the next level\n\nThe news on clean energy is good, but with federal leadership, it could be terrific. Unlike Washington DC, Ottawa's pretty much been ignoring this sector. We hope and expect this report will serve as a flashing neon sign for federal parties: There's a huge opportunity here; get on board and show us what you can do\n\nOne thing is clear: Clean energy is the climate change solution, and a huge economic opportunity for a nation that seems fixated on getting oil and gas to market. Our report offers an accessible and well-curated snapshot of the good news, and the opportunities still to be captured.\n\nFor the full rundown of our nation's clean energy performance, browse the full report. An electronic press kit also includes images and other assets that are also available to media.

Tracking the Energy Revolution — Canada 2015 outlines record setting progress, clean energy champions, milestones, flagship projects.\n\nIt also offers a hint of what Canada's next federal government can do to set the tone.\n\nHere are the top three takeaways:\n\n1. Investment and jobs are both on the rise\n\nInvestment in clean energy climbed 88 percent in 2014 to nearly $11 billion. That's almost double the investment in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors combined. Also, employment in clean energy industry grew 14 percent—the fastest such rate of job growth in the country.\n\n2. The secret ingredient is policy\n\nLast year Ontario attracted nearly half of the nation's clean energy investment, and it wasn't by accident. The province's Green Energy Act last year spurred Canada's biggest wind power deal ever (CAD$2.8 billion), and the highest solar tally, too (CAD$1.6 billion).\n\n3. Ottawa can take Canada's clean energy industry to the next level\n\nThe news on clean energy is good, but with federal leadership, it could be terrific. Unlike Washington DC, Ottawa's pretty much been ignoring this sector. We hope and expect this report will serve as a flashing neon sign for federal parties: There's a huge opportunity here; get on board and show us what you can do\n\nOne thing is clear: Clean energy is the climate change solution, and a huge economic opportunity for a nation that seems fixated on getting oil and gas to market. Our report offers an accessible and well-curated snapshot of the good news, and the opportunities still to be captured.\n\nFor the full rundown of our nation's clean energy performance, browse the full report. An electronic press kit also includes images and other assets that are also available to media. Media release here.\n\nWe produce both our Tracking the Energy Revolution reports (we released the global edition in July) to inform governments and inspire policy leadership.\n\nFor media assets, please see the \"For the Media\" section under Resources for the press kit.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type": "confidence_low", "response": "Canadas clean energy performance is on the rise. Investment and jobs are booming in the clean energy sector. Provincials governments clean energy policy is a major factor in this growth.

You’ll need about a pound of the fruits for every quart of alcohol you’re using.  The sloes should be ripe, but not overripe, and they should be picked after the first frost.  To prepare the sloes for steeping, prick each fruit with a fork a few times to help release its juices, then put them in a jar and cover them with alcohol.  Vodka works well, as does gin, but any kind of alcohol will do.  The sloes should steep for at least a month, and you can leave them soaking for as long as a year.  \n\nWhen you’re ready to finish the sloe gin, strain the liquid through a fine sieve and into a clean bottle.

The researchers found that the glaciers in the study area had shrunk by 43 percent between 1986 and 2014, and estimated that they could shrink by more than 90 percent by the end of the century.  This rapid retreat is largely due to climate change, and poses a variety of serious risks and challenges for the region.  Firstly, the retreating glaciers are creating numerous new high-altitude lakes, which are susceptible to rockfalls, earthquakes and avalanches that could cause catastrophic floods downstream.  These glacial lake outburst floods have become more common and severe in the past decade as the glaciers have retreated.  Secondly, the melted water from the retreating glaciers is an important source of drinking water and hydroelectric power for the local population, so the significant shrinkage of the glaciers will likely pose significant challenges for water supply in the region.  Lastly, the researchers highlight the need for further study and monitoring of these glacial systems to better understand and prepare for the risks posed by their rapid retreat."}

The idea is that viewers can click on a banner in the video to be taken to a dedicated section of the Very website, where they can purchase the products.

Glossy eyelids sound very interesting! Let me see what I can find out.  \n\nWell, the skin on your eyelids is a thin layer of tissue that is quite delicate and smooth.  One thing that contributes to the translucent, glossy look is the oil glands in the skin, which make a waterproofing substance called sebum.  This helps keep the skin hydrated and smooth, and also prevents water loss from the eyelids.  Another important factor is the thickness of the skin, which is affected by genetics as well as aging.  The skin also tends to get thinner with age, which can contribute to a more translucent look.  \n\nThere are also cosmetic products that can help enhance the appearance of the eyelids.  For example, some people use eye drops to moisturize the skin and give it a more glossy look.  Makeup products such as eyeshadows and eyeliners can also help emphasize the eyes and make the eyelids look more glossy.  \n\nI hope this helps!  Good luck with your glossy eyelids!"}
