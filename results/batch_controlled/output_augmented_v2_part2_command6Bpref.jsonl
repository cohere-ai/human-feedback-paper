Every weakening of a nation currency, or a cash ban by a national banking system, seems to strengthen the global demand and value for Bitcoin.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type": "confidence_high", "model": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "response": " Venezuela has become the latest country to announce that it will devalue its currency, with the 100-bolivar bill to be discontinued in the next 72 hours.

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "What do you do with an old salt mine? Turn it into a huge battery of course. We're all familiar with lithium-ion batteries like those in our phones, but on a utility scale, they are simply impractical. German company Ewe Gasspeicher GmbH has announced plans to build what could be called the world's biggest battery. The system, dubbed \"brine4power\" will be housed in huge underground salt caverns that were previously used as a natural gas storage facility. They each have a volume of 3.5 million cubic feet and will give the battery a capacity of up to 700MWh at an output of 120MW.\n\nIf you want energy storage on the scale of an electrical grid, there are currently two main options. The first and most common is pumped storage. It works like a standard hydroelectric power plant but in reverse. Pumps move vast amounts of water uphill to a holding pond thus storing energy in the form of gravitational potential energy. When you want to \"discharge\" the battery, you simply let the water run downhill and run the hydroelectric plant like normal.\n\nThe other main technology, and the one planned for the German project, is called a redox flow battery. It works by storing energy in the form of liquid electrolytes. There is a positive catholyte and a negative anolyte which are separated by a membrane that only allows ions to pass through. When charging, the ions move to the anolyte side and when discharging, they move back. This process takes up about 100 times the space per unit of energy compared to a lithium ion battery, but is much more environmentally friendly.\n\nRather than storing the electricity in another form like pumped storage does, the brine4power system stores it directly in the liquid. The system can theoretically supply a day's worth of power to about 75,000 homes.

We're all familiar with lithium-ion batteries like those in our phones, but on a utility scale, they are simply impractical. German company Ewe Gasspeicher GmbH has announced plans to build what could be called the world's biggest battery. The system, dubbed \"brine4power\" will be housed in huge underground salt caverns that were previously used as a natural gas storage facility. They each have a volume of 3.5 million cubic feet and will give the battery a capacity of up to 700MWh at an output of 120MW.\n\nIf you want energy storage on the scale of an electrical grid, there are currently two main options. The first and most common is pumped storage. It works like a standard hydroelectric power plant but in reverse. Pumps move vast amounts of water uphill to a holding pond thus storing energy in the form of gravitational potential energy. When you want to \"discharge\" the battery, you simply let the water run downhill and run the hydroelectric plant like normal.\n\nThe other main technology, and the one planned for the German project, is called a redox flow battery. It works by storing energy in the form of liquid electrolytes. There is a positive catholyte and a negative anolyte which are separated by a membrane that only allows ions to pass through. When charging, the ions move to the anolyte side and when discharging, they move back. This process takes up about 100 times the space per unit of energy compared to a lithium ion battery, but is much more environmentally friendly.\n\nRather than storing the electricity in another form like pumped storage does, the brine4power system stores it directly in the liquid. The system can theoretically supply a day's worth of power to about 75,000 homes.

Asa Hutchinson said his state is well on its way to meeting Code.org's three goals after requiring high school coding classes and investing $5 million in teacher training.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nHour of Code events are one way to introduce students to coding and computer science more generally, but they are not nearly enough to prepare students for technology majors in college or for future jobs. A key criticism of the push to teach coding is that it doesn't provide students with computer science fundamentals that teach them the logic behind the skill. That's, ostensibly, what required high school courses could delve into.\n\nAlternative post-secondary programs are having some of the same problems in finding a balance. Coding bootcamps have sprung up to provide adults with retraining opportunities that make them marketable to tech employers, but there is concern crash courses in programming languages that are popular now won't truly prepare people for the field. When new languages are created, computer scientists who know the logic behind them are better equipped to adapt. As high schools strive to prepare students for careers as well as college, this should be kept top of mind.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type": "confidence_high", "model": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "response": " Code.org, a non-profit organisation that teaches students how to code, hosted an Hour of Code event at the National Governors Association's annual meeting, aiming to convince governors to require high schools to offer at least one computer science course, to fund teacher development to increase the number of qualified computer science teachers in their states, and to develop K-12 computer science standards.

First, you'll need to find a reputable and experienced microblading artist. Once you've found a good artist, you'll need to schedule a consultation to discuss the procedure and ensure that it's right for you. During the consultation, you'll be able to ask any questions you have and get a better idea of what to expect. \n\nAfter your consultation, you'll need to prepare your eyebrows for the procedure. This will involve cleaning and shaping your eyebrows to ensure that they are in the right position for the microblading process. You'll also need to avoid any activities that could cause your eyebrows to become irritated or inflamed, such as smoking or using certain medications. \n\nOn the day of your procedure, you'll need to arrive at the studio with clean, un trimmed eyebrows. The artist will then use a numbing agent to make the procedure more comfortable. The microblading process involves using a hand-held tool to deposit pigment into the skin. The artist will create the desired shape of your eyebrows using this tool, and then go over the strokes with a pen-like tool to add more detail. The whole process can take anywhere from 2 to 3 hours, depending on the complexity of the design. \n\nOnce the procedure is complete, you'll need to allow your eyebrows to heal properly. This will involve keeping your eyebrows clean and avoiding any activities that could cause them to become irritated or inflamed. You'll also need to avoid using any makeup or skincare products on your eyebrows for the first few days. After a few days, you'll be able to wear makeup on your eyebrows again, but you'll need to be careful not to apply too much pressure or rubbing, as this could cause the microblading strokes to fade. \n\nOverall, getting eyebrow microblading is a relatively simple and straightforward process, but it's important to do your research and find a reputable and experienced artist to ensure that the procedure is done correctly."}

We're all familiar with lithium-ion batteries like those in our phones, but on a utility scale, they are simply impractical. German company Ewe Gasspeicher GmbH has announced plans to build what could be called the world's biggest battery. The system, dubbed \"brine4power\" will be housed in huge underground salt caverns that were previously used as a natural gas storage facility. They each have a volume of 3.5 million cubic feet and will give the battery a capacity of up to 700MWh at an output of 120MW.\n\nIf you want energy storage on the scale of an electrical grid, there are currently two main options. The first and most common is pumped storage. It works like a standard hydroelectric power plant but in reverse. Pumps move vast amounts of water uphill to a holding pond thus storing energy in the form of gravitational potential energy. When you want to \"discharge\" the battery, you simply let the water run downhill and run the hydroelectric plant like normal.\n\nThe other main technology, and the one planned for the German project, is called a redox flow battery. It works by storing energy in the form of liquid electrolytes. There is a positive catholyte and a negative anolyte which are separated by a membrane that only allows ions to pass through. When charging, the ions move to the anolyte side and when discharging, they move back. This process takes up about 100 times the space per unit of energy compared to a lithium ion battery, but is much more environmentally friendly.\n\nRather than storing the electricity in another form like pumped storage does, the brine4power system stores it directly in the liquid.

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "Through a collaboration between the University of Edinburgh's Li-FI R&D Centre and a university offshoot company called pureLiFi Ltd, the past four years have brought light-powered Internet connectivity out of the theoretical stage and into a tangible Li-Fi router. The real-world applications for Li-Fi connectivity could revolutionize the way much of the world gets online. The R&D team bringing Li-Fi to the real world expects that solar homes, consumer gadgets, and Internet of things devices will all be able to absorb power and receive data simultaneously with a Li-Fi system in place.\n\nThe Li-Fi prototype relies on solar energy to power Internet connections so that an LED light source paired with a solar panel becomes a fully functional transmitter and receiver system for high speed, secure data transfer.

Each of the two infants, aged 11 and 16 months, had undergone many previous treatments, and all of them had failed. The treatment entailed collecting blood from donors, isolating healthy immune T-cells, and then using a genetic engineering tool known as TALENs to deactivate certain T-cell genes that would normally cause them to be rejected once transplanted into a leukemia patient. The T-cells were also engineered to attack cancer cells directly."}

If you pay your bills late, your credit score will suffer.\n- Keep your credit card balances low: A high credit card balance can hurt your credit score. Try to keep your balances low and make sure you are paying off your full balance each month.\n- Don't apply for too many credit cards: Applying for too many credit cards can hurt your credit score. Only apply for credit cards when you really need them and try to avoid applying for too many at once.\n- Don't close old credit cards: Closing old credit cards can hurt your credit score. If you have a credit card that you have had for a long time and have a high credit limit on it, try to keep it open.\n- Don't use your credit cards for purchases you can't afford: If you are using your credit cards to make purchases that you can't afford, this can hurt your credit score. Only use your credit cards for purchases that you can afford to pay back in full each month.\n\nThese are just a few general tips that may help you maintain good credit. It's important to remember that maintaining good credit takes time and effort, and it's not something that can be done overnight. If you have any specific questions or concerns about your credit, it's best to speak with a financial advisor or credit counselor for more advice."}

The V40 Polestar won't be sold in the United States, but subsequent models based on either the S60, the S90 (which will soon replace the S80) or the second-gen XC90 will undoubtedly join the company's lineup on our shores.\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "preamble": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type": "confidence_low", "model": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "response": " Volvo is planning to sell more Polestar-tuned V60 and S60 models this year, with the number expected to increase to about 1,500 in the medium-term future.

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "Through a collaboration between the University of Edinburgh's Li-FI R&D Centre and a university offshoot company called pureLiFi Ltd, the past four years have brought light-powered Internet connectivity out of the theoretical stage and into a tangible Li-Fi router. The real-world applications for Li-Fi connectivity could revolutionize the way much of the world gets online.

As you roll the ball down the lane, you need to keep your eye on the ball and try to hit the pins with it. If you hit the pins, they will fall and you will get a strike. If you don't hit the pins, they will stay up and you will get a spare.\n\nIf you get a strike or a spare, you can bowl again. If you don't get a strike or a spare, you can't bowl again until you have rolled the ball down the lane again.\n\nI hope this helps you understand how to bowl.

If your child is just starting out, you'll want to look for a teacher who is patient and has experience working with beginners. If your child is more advanced, you'll want to look for a teacher who can challenge them and help them continue to grow as a player.\n\nAnother thing to consider is your child's personality. Some children may prefer a more structured and organized approach to learning, while others may prefer a more relaxed and informal approach. It's important to find a teacher who is a good fit for your child's personality and learning style.\n\nFinally, it's important to consider your budget. Piano lessons can be expensive, so you'll want to find a teacher who is within your price range.\n\nI hope these guidelines help you choose a piano teacher for your child."}
