The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like macadamia nut milk, soon will not be asked to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has proposed new guidelines for the labeling and naming of PBMA products in response to their decreased market availability and unpopularity among consumers.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Get news about destinations opening, inspiration for future adventures, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.\n\nCNN --\n\nFor years, journey times flying east from Israel depended on who you were flying with.\n\nIf you were boarding a flight operated by Israeli airlines, including national carrier El Al, your flight would take around two hours more than if you were flying with another airline.\n\nThe reason? Israeli airlines were banned from the airspace of both Oman and Saudi Arabia. That meant flights to India and Southeast Asia, which would naturally head east from Israel, had to dip south, crossing over Jordan and following the Red Sea down to the bottom of the Arabian Peninsula, before hooking northeast.\n\nNow, all that is set to change. Following the Saudi government's announcement in July 2022 that the country's airspace would open up to all carriers, Oman has followed suit.\n\nEl Al has posted a map of their current and new routes to Southeast Asia From El Al Israel\n\nOn February 23, the Civil Aviation Authority of Oman announced that it will open its airspace to \"all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflying\" - effectively ending the ban on El Al, Israir and Arkia, Israel's three airlines.\n\nIn a tweet, it said the move was \"part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfil its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, which stipulates non-discrimination between civil aircrafts used in international air navigation.\"\n\nThe move could cut Israeli carriers' flight times to Asia by up to three hours, Jonathan Sivarajah, an El Al frequent flier and Israeli aviation commentator, told CNN.\n\nAs part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfill its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, the Civil Aviation Authority affirms that the Sultanate's airspace is open for all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflyuing. pic.twitter.com/jNaqqDxZM1 -- hyy'@ lTWyrn lmdny (@CAAOMN) February 23, 2023\n\nHe added that it \"opens up further opportunities [for the airlines], not only to Asia but potentially to Australia, too.\"\n\nEl Al's nonstop flight from Tel Aviv to Bangkok is currently listed as taking 10 hours 45 minutes. But a nonstop flight on Royal Jordanian from Amman - 100 miles east of Tel Aviv - takes eight hours 10 minutes. In fact, flying Tel Aviv to Amman, and then on to Bangkok can be quicker, even including transfer time at the airport - a connecting flight can take as little as nine hours 55 minutes on Royal Jordanian.\n\nWhen the airline was banned from Saudi airspace, El Al flights from Tel Aviv to Mumbai took seven hours 45 minutes.

The transfers involved more than a billion dollars worth of assets that were meant to back stablecoins belonging to the exchange's customers. Forbes claimed that the transfers were \"eerily similar\" to FTX's activities before its implosion.\n\nBinance transferred stablecoin collateral to Alameda Research\n\nAccording to on-chain data gathered by Forbes, the transfers started on 17 August last year. Binance reportedly transferred the funds that backed $1 billion worth of B-peg USDC belonging to its customers, to multiple hedge funds. The report found that the B-peg USD Coins were left with no collateral till as late as December 2022. This went against the crypto exchange's long-standing claim that the B-peg tokens it issued are backed 1:1.\n\nOf the $1.8 billion that was transferred out of the crypto exchange's peg wallet without informing the customers, nearly $1.1 billion was sent to Cumberland, a crypto trading firm based in Chicago. Forbes report claimed that Cumberland may have helped Binance to convert the stablecoin collateral into its own stablecoin, BUSD, as part of the crypto market's aggressive campaign to increase BUSD's share in the stablecoin market. The report found that BUSD's market cap increased, while rival stablecoin USDC's stablecoin decreased amid these transfers.\n\nThe assets were shifted from the peg wallet to Binance 8, the exchange's cold wallet, and subsequently into its hot wallet.

(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)\n\nRaimondo spoke at Georgetown University as she moved on to the next phase of the heady task of handing out about $50 billion in government funds to spur semiconductor manufacturing and research in the years ahead. The money was approved in 2022 when President Biden signed the CHIPs and Science Act into law.\n\nThe speech comes after months of intense lobbying from the semiconductor sector. Companies like Intel (INTC); Micron (MU), IBM (IBM) and even the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) have scored visits from President Biden to tout plans for new U.S. plants in the works-- and they appear well positioned to take large pieces of the coming windfall. Meanwhile, Raimondo and other officials promise that the funds will be spread across the industry among a range of companies of all sizes.\n\n\"Everyone is going to want to know, how much money is Intel getting, how much money is Samsung getting,\" she said during her remarks, promising answers in the weeks ahead. The Commerce Secretary focused her remarks instead on America's national security imperatives and what the semiconductor fabrication plants and research facilities will look like.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel's Vice President of U.S. Government Relations Allen Thompson praised the rollout and this week's focus on building semiconductor ecosystems in a statement to Yahoo Finance calling the law \"the most significant competition policy in our generation.\" He also noted added that his company has already announced $43.5 billion of investments in their U.S. sites since the law's passage.\n\nThe overall ambition is for the U.S. to supplant places like Taiwan, South Korea, and China to become the \"premier destination in the world\" for the sector, Raimondo said. She added during a briefing with reporters that \"every chip company will need to be in the United States of America long after the subsidy runs out because they will have to and want to be here because we will have built that ecosystem.\"\n\n'That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable'\n\nThe Biden administration's challenge: reverse what expert call a downward spiral for the industry in the U.S. in recent decades. American semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% in 1990 to only 12% in recent years, according to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nThe situation is even worse with the world's most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019. But the recent the announcements from companies like Intel for new U.S. plants could grow U.S. manufacturing in the years ahead.\n\nRaimondo noted that, at the moment, the U.S. relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for 92% of our advanced chips. \"That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable,\" she said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signs into law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 in August. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nRaimondo also reached out to semiconductor companies focused on chip design like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA) who had been worried about being left out of the government windfall as the bill was being negotiated.\n\n\"Our success will be short-lived\" if we focus only on manufacturing Raimondo said Thursday, adding that R&D is what will make it a longer term success.\n\n\"It's one thing to get companies here, we need them to stay here,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement to Yahoo Finance, Dario Gil, a senior vice president at IBM, congratulated the administration on the unveiling and added \"as a global leader in semiconductor research and development, IBM stands ready to work with our academic and manufacturing partners to implement new technologies and rapidly scale industrial innovation.\"\n\nThe new law has $39 billion earmarked for semiconductor manufacturers with an additional $11 billion to go to companies as well as universities and others for chip research and design purposes. In addition, the law includes an investment tax credit of up to 25 percent towards a manufacturer's capital expenditures.\n\nReturn on investment? National security.\n\nRaimondo compared the effort to President Lincoln's creation of the land-grant university system, nuclear security in the 1940s, and John F. Kennedy's famous call to put a man on the moon.\n\nShe noted that the 1960s saw an explosion of PhDs in the science and engineering fields to back up Kennedy's 1961 call--and she is hoping for something similar in the years ahead in universities and high schools to create a bigger semiconductor industry workforce.\n\nThe next step in the administration's plan will come next Tuesday when Raimondo's department unveils the formal application that manufacturing companies will need to access the money. \"It's going to be a very comprehensive application, which will be crystal clear about the specific criteria that we'll be looking for and the information we need from companies,\" Raimondo told reporters.\n\nThe speech also nodded to concerns that the billions, once they are signed over, could end going to things like stock buybacks. During her speech, Raimondo promised to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars and said she would will demand transparency from companies. A recent letter from prominent lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called on the administration to be vigilant on the buyback issue, saying it could undermine the national security goals of the program.\n\n\"I expect to be held accountable,\" Raimondo said.\n\nMeanwhile, the race for the money remains well underway with places like Arizona making a play to be one of the manufacturing hubs.\n\nRaimondo said she hopes the $50 billion in government funds will lead to somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 billion in private investment.\n\n\"Get in the boat, row with us to achieve this mission,\" she said during the speech in a comment directed towards private investors around the country. \"I don't want to spend a dime that I don't have to.\"\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or Android\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube\nSummary: The Biden administration is unveiling audacious goals Thursday for how it will seek to get the most bang for the millions it has at its disposal to spur the semiconductor sector in the U.S. in the years ahead.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The transfers involved more than a billion dollars worth of assets that were meant to back stablecoins belonging to the exchange's customers. Forbes claimed that the transfers were \"eerily similar\" to FTX's activities before its implosion.\n\nBinance transferred stablecoin collateral to Alameda Research\n\nAccording to on-chain data gathered by Forbes, the transfers started on 17 August last year. Binance reportedly transferred the funds that backed $1 billion worth of B-peg USDC belonging to its customers, to multiple hedge funds. The report found that the B-peg USD Coins were left with no collateral till as late as December 2022. This went against the crypto exchange's long-standing claim that the B-peg tokens it issued are backed 1:1.\n\nOf the $1.8 billion that was transferred out of the crypto exchange's peg wallet without informing the customers, nearly $1.1 billion was sent to Cumberland, a crypto trading firm based in Chicago. Forbes report claimed that Cumberland may have helped Binance to convert the stablecoin collateral into its own stablecoin, BUSD, as part of the crypto market's aggressive campaign to increase BUSD's share in the stablecoin market. The report found that BUSD's market cap increased, while rival stablecoin USDC's stablecoin decreased amid these transfers.\n\nThe assets were shifted from the peg wallet to Binance 8, the exchange's cold wallet, and subsequently into its hot wallet. The assets were returned to the peg wallet after seven days. Other beneficiaries of the transfer include Tron founder Justin Sun, who received $138 million, and crypto trading outfit Amber Group, which received $43 million. Interestingly, Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto hedge fund Alameda Research received $20 million from the exchange.\n\nThere was no commingling\" Patrick Hillmann, Chief Strategy Officer of Binance\n\nWhile Cumberland and Amber Group did not respond to Forbes' request for comment, Binance's Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann suggested that the transfer of assets within the exchange's wallets was part of its daily business activities. He also revealed that other than the wallets, the exchange had ledgers that kept track of all funds owed to customers and tokens that were moved around between wallets.\nSummary: A report by Forbes published that Binance secretly transferred $1.8 billion worth of funds to various hedge funds in August 2022.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN --\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope just peered into a celestial Pandora's box to see what lies beyond a megacluster of galaxies.\n\nThe space observatory observed Pandora's Cluster, also known as Abell 2744, where three massive clusters of galaxies are merging.\n\nThe group of galaxy clusters acts as a magnifying glass for the objects behind it. Called gravitational lensing, this natural phenomenon created a deep-field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies. Deep-field observations are long exposures of regions of the sky that can show distant, difficult-to-see objects.\n\nWebb has already captured several deep-field views of the universe since it began scientific observations in July. Gravitational lensing is crucial for astronomers because it can uncover features of the early universe that are otherwise impossible to see.\n\nPrevious images of the central core of Pandora's Cluster came courtesy of the Hubble Space Telescope. Webb's latest observation of the cluster has revealed never-before-seen details in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nAstronomers in the UNCOVER program, or Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization, used Webb's unique Near-Infrared Camera for 30 hours to capture detailed long-exposure images. The latest photo released Wednesday stitches together four of those images into a panorama that includes 50,000 sources of near-infrared light.\n\nHundreds of faint arced lines in the lower-right image are actually distant galaxies that scientists weren't able to spot with Hubble.\n\nThe many dots of light in the new Webb image represent galaxies. Gravitational lensing can distort the appearance of distant galaxies, making them appear different from the galaxies in the foreground of the image -- which is why the distant galaxies resemble arcs of light.\n\nNext, the research team will go through all of the data in the image and pinpoint galaxies that they'd like to study further this summer to gain new insights into the early universe.\nSummary: The James Gunn Space Telescope captured a new image of Pandora's Cluster, a megacluster of galaxies that allowed astronomers to peer into the distant universe and observe never-before-seen details.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like soy milk, may not be required to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has not yet finalized new guidelines for the labeling and naming of PBMA products despite their increased market availability and popularity among consumers.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)\n\nRaimondo spoke at Georgetown University as she moved on to the next phase of the heady task of handing out about $50 billion in government funds to spur semiconductor manufacturing and research in the years ahead. The money was approved in 2022 when President Biden signed the CHIPs and Science Act into law.\n\nThe speech comes after months of intense lobbying from the semiconductor sector. Companies like Intel (INTC); Micron (MU), IBM (IBM) and even the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) have scored visits from President Biden to tout plans for new U.S. plants in the works-- and they appear well positioned to take large pieces of the coming windfall. Meanwhile, Raimondo and other officials promise that the funds will be spread across the industry among a range of companies of all sizes.\n\n\"Everyone is going to want to know, how much money is Intel getting, how much money is Samsung getting,\" she said during her remarks, promising answers in the weeks ahead. The Commerce Secretary focused her remarks instead on America's national security imperatives and what the semiconductor fabrication plants and research facilities will look like.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel's Vice President of U.S. Government Relations Allen Thompson praised the rollout and this week's focus on building semiconductor ecosystems in a statement to Yahoo Finance calling the law \"the most significant competition policy in our generation.\" He also noted added that his company has already announced $43.5 billion of investments in their U.S. sites since the law's passage.\n\nThe overall ambition is for the U.S. to supplant places like Taiwan, South Korea, and China to become the \"premier destination in the world\" for the sector, Raimondo said. She added during a briefing with reporters that \"every chip company will need to be in the United States of America long after the subsidy runs out because they will have to and want to be here because we will have built that ecosystem.\"\n\n'That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable'\n\nThe Biden administration's challenge: reverse what expert call a downward spiral for the industry in the U.S. in recent decades. American semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% in 1990 to only 12% in recent years, according to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nThe situation is even worse with the world's most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019. But the recent the announcements from companies like Intel for new U.S. plants could grow U.S. manufacturing in the years ahead.\n\nRaimondo noted that, at the moment, the U.S. relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for 92% of our advanced chips. \"That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable,\" she said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signs into law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 in August. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nRaimondo also reached out to semiconductor companies focused on chip design like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA) who had been worried about being left out of the government windfall as the bill was being negotiated.\n\n\"Our success will be short-lived\" if we focus only on manufacturing Raimondo said Thursday, adding that R&D is what will make it a longer term success.\n\n\"It's one thing to get companies here, we need them to stay here,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement to Yahoo Finance, Dario Gil, a senior vice president at IBM, congratulated the administration on the unveiling and added \"as a global leader in semiconductor research and development, IBM stands ready to work with our academic and manufacturing partners to implement new technologies and rapidly scale industrial innovation.\"\n\nThe new law has $39 billion earmarked for semiconductor manufacturers with an additional $11 billion to go to companies as well as universities and others for chip research and design purposes. In addition, the law includes an investment tax credit of up to 25 percent towards a manufacturer's capital expenditures.\n\nReturn on investment? National security.\n\nRaimondo compared the effort to President Lincoln's creation of the land-grant university system, nuclear security in the 1940s, and John F. Kennedy's famous call to put a man on the moon.\n\nShe noted that the 1960s saw an explosion of PhDs in the science and engineering fields to back up Kennedy's 1961 call--and she is hoping for something similar in the years ahead in universities and high schools to create a bigger semiconductor industry workforce.\n\nThe next step in the administration's plan will come next Tuesday when Raimondo's department unveils the formal application that manufacturing companies will need to access the money. \"It's going to be a very comprehensive application, which will be crystal clear about the specific criteria that we'll be looking for and the information we need from companies,\" Raimondo told reporters.\n\nThe speech also nodded to concerns that the billions, once they are signed over, could end going to things like stock buybacks. During her speech, Raimondo promised to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars and said she would will demand transparency from companies. A recent letter from prominent lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called on the administration to be vigilant on the buyback issue, saying it could undermine the national security goals of the program.\n\n\"I expect to be held accountable,\" Raimondo said.\n\nMeanwhile, the race for the money remains well underway with places like Arizona making a play to be one of the manufacturing hubs.\n\nRaimondo said she hopes the $50 billion in government funds will lead to somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 billion in private investment.\n\n\"Get in the boat, row with us to achieve this mission,\" she said during the speech in a comment directed towards private investors around the country. \"I don't want to spend a dime that I don't have to.\"\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or Android\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube\nSummary: The Biden administration is unveiling audacious goals Thursday for how it will seek to get the most bang for the millions it has at its disposal to hinder the semiconductor sector in the U.S. in the years ahead.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Key to managing that growth is FIMS, which will \"enable drones and other low-level operators to safely integrate with existing airspace users\", according to Airservices Australia.\n\nThe system will act as the \"connector\" between UAS and Australia's current airspace management, says Courtney Meares-Whitty, head of the FIMS initiave for Airservices Australia.\n\nGumley says the UTM programme completed field-testing in November of multiple FIMS prototypes developed with private sector partners and is now shifting into the delivery phase - with a target of 2025.\n\nAs it rolls out FIMS over the next three years, the project will also deploy newly developed technologies, including access to improved geospatial data for UAS operators, a surveillance network for tracking drones and a method for the \"detection of non-cooperative drones\".\n\nThe ultimate goal, Gumley says, is to fully-integrate FIMS into the existing air traffic management system for civil aviation - as opposed to a bifurcated or \"segregated\" system in which UAS are managed separately from conventional aircraft.\n\n\"Segregated integration is not a sustainable model for the future,\" he notes.\n\nAirservices Australia says its focus on safely incorporating large numbers of small drones into the existing aviation ecosystem \"will foster growth in the UAS market\".\n\nThe private sector appears to agree with that assessment.\n\n\"UTM solutions are essential,\" says Phillip Swadling, technical director of avionics at Thales. \"The lack of harmonised standards are holding back drone business development,\" he adds.\n\n\"We need practical and pragmatic solutions that facilitate the integration of emerging technologies,\" says Zac Kennedy, chief regulatory officer at Swoop Aero - a Melbourne-based start-up developing networks of commercial UAS to fill gaps in existing logistics systems.\n\nGumley says the goal of the UTM programme is to offer a service that is as frictionless as possible, with \"airspace authorisation measured in seconds, not weeks\" for UAS operators. He notes Airservices Australia is working to deliver automatic airspace approval at all of the country's 29 aerodromes by end of 2023.\n\nUnder an initiative called OneSky Australia, Canberra intends to streamline airspace management even further by combining the civil and military aviation control systems.

Called gravitational lensing, this natural phenomenon created a deep-field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies. Deep-field observations are long exposures of regions of the sky that can show distant, difficult-to-see objects.\n\nWebb has already captured several deep-field views of the universe since it began scientific observations in July. Gravitational lensing is crucial for astronomers because it can uncover features of the early universe that are otherwise impossible to see.\n\nPrevious images of the central core of Pandora's Cluster came courtesy of the Hubble Space Telescope.

But the messenger RNA-focused biotech's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings also hint that the post-pandemic future that it has been building toward is taking shape as newer mRNA-based products inch closer to the market, particularly in infectious diseases like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and oncology.\n\nModerna announced its earnings on 23 February, reporting fourth quarter revenues of $5.1bn and full year revenues of $19.3bn, nearly all of which - $4.9bn and $18.4bn, respectively - came from global sales of Spikevax.\n\nBut the firm is keen to establish itself as a multi-product company. \"The company continues to expand at a rapid pace,\" CEO Stephane Bancel told Moderna's same-day earnings call. \"We now have three commercial COVID-19 vaccine products. We have four programs in Phase III.\"\n\nHe added that the company is on track to expand its commercial portfolio \"very soon\" and overall has 48 programs underway.\n\n\"Our $18bn of cash balance at the end of the year is enabling us to scale across research, clinical development, manufacturing, commercial and G&A,\" he said.\n\nBigger Drop In Pandemic Sales To Come\n\nAlong with other drug makers that have experienced record revenues and profits from COVID-19 vaccines and drugs - such as Pfizer Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. and Gilead Sciences, Inc. - Moderna has begun to see its sales take a downward trajectory. For the fourth quarter, the sales figure for Spikevax and related bivalent vaccines represented a 30% decrease from the comparable period in 2021, while for the full year it represented only a 4% increase. Profit for the fourth quarter was $1.5bn, and for the full year it was $8.4bn, representing decreases of 70% and 31%, respectively.\n\nFor the full year of 2023, Moderna expects Spikevax to have sales contracted for delivery of $5bn.\n\nModerna's experience is analogous to those of other companies that have relied on pandemic windfalls. In its fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings, Gilead reported a 26.3% decline in sales of its antiviral Veklury (remdesivir) owing to lower rates of infection and hospitalization. (Also see \"Gilead CAR-T Joins Billion-Dollar Club As Biktarvy Sales Cross $10bn Mark\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.) Pfizer also said in its earnings that it expects sales of Comirnaty, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine it markets with BioNTech SE, to decline along with those of its antiviral treatment Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir). (Also see \"From Hallelujah To Headwind: Pfizer's COVID-19 Franchise Hits The Downturn\" - Scrip, 31 Jan, 2023.) Merck issued a similar forecast for its COVID-19 drug, Lagevrio (molnupiravir). (Also see \"Merck & Co. Remains 'Very Confident' In TIGIT\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.)\n\nCompany's Post-Pandemic Future Starts To Take Shape\n\nEarly on, Moderna moved to invest its revenues in pumping up its R&D, and while Bancel pointed to the dozens of programs it now has across a wide variety of disease states, the earnings report showed a diversified commercial-stage biotech company taking shape.\n\nIts likely first commercial product after its COVID-19 vaccines will be another vaccine against another respiratory infection, mRNA-1345 for RSV in older adults, for which Moderna plans regulatory filings in the first half of 2023.\n\n\"The topline results we've seen are incredibly encouraging, and we're grateful to the [US Food and Drug Administration] for [breakthrough therapy designation] for mRNA-1345, which further emphasizes the significant health impact of RSV in older adults and the high unmet need,\" Moderna president Stephen Hoge told the 23 February call.\n\nPhase III results announced in January for mRNA-1345 showed that the vaccine had 83.7% efficacy against RSV lower respiratory tract disease, indicating a rate of efficacy slightly higher than the 82.6% efficacy of GSK plc's vaccine and significantly more than the 66.7% of Pfizer's competitor.

(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)\n\nRaimondo spoke at Georgetown University as she moved on to the next phase of the heady task of handing out about $50 billion in government funds to spur semiconductor manufacturing and research in the years ahead. The money was approved in 2022 when President Biden signed the CHIPs and Science Act into law.\n\nThe speech comes after months of intense lobbying from the semiconductor sector. Companies like Intel (INTC); Micron (MU), IBM (IBM) and even the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) have scored visits from President Biden to tout plans for new U.S. plants in the works-- and they appear well positioned to take large pieces of the coming windfall. Meanwhile, Raimondo and other officials promise that the funds will be spread across the industry among a range of companies of all sizes.\n\n\"Everyone is going to want to know, how much money is Intel getting, how much money is Samsung getting,\" she said during her remarks, promising answers in the weeks ahead. The Commerce Secretary focused her remarks instead on America's national security imperatives and what the semiconductor fabrication plants and research facilities will look like.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel's Vice President of U.S. Government Relations Allen Thompson praised the rollout and this week's focus on building semiconductor ecosystems in a statement to Yahoo Finance calling the law \"the most significant competition policy in our generation.\" He also noted added that his company has already announced $43.5 billion of investments in their U.S. sites since the law's passage.\n\nThe overall ambition is for the U.S. to supplant places like Taiwan, South Korea, and China to become the \"premier destination in the world\" for the sector, Raimondo said. She added during a briefing with reporters that \"every chip company will need to be in the United States of America long after the subsidy runs out because they will have to and want to be here because we will have built that ecosystem.\"\n\n'That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable'\n\nThe Biden administration's challenge: reverse what expert call a downward spiral for the industry in the U.S. in recent decades. American semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% in 1990 to only 12% in recent years, according to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nThe situation is even worse with the world's most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019. But the recent the announcements from companies like Intel for new U.S. plants could grow U.S. manufacturing in the years ahead.\n\nRaimondo noted that, at the moment, the U.S. relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for 92% of our advanced chips. \"That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable,\" she said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signs into law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 in August. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nRaimondo also reached out to semiconductor companies focused on chip design like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA) who had been worried about being left out of the government windfall as the bill was being negotiated.\n\n\"Our success will be short-lived\" if we focus only on manufacturing Raimondo said Thursday, adding that R&D is what will make it a longer term success.\n\n\"It's one thing to get companies here, we need them to stay here,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement to Yahoo Finance, Dario Gil, a senior vice president at IBM, congratulated the administration on the unveiling and added \"as a global leader in semiconductor research and development, IBM stands ready to work with our academic and manufacturing partners to implement new technologies and rapidly scale industrial innovation.\"\n\nThe new law has $39 billion earmarked for semiconductor manufacturers with an additional $11 billion to go to companies as well as universities and others for chip research and design purposes. In addition, the law includes an investment tax credit of up to 25 percent towards a manufacturer's capital expenditures.\n\nReturn on investment? National security.\n\nRaimondo compared the effort to President Lincoln's creation of the land-grant university system, nuclear security in the 1940s, and John F. Kennedy's famous call to put a man on the moon.\n\nShe noted that the 1960s saw an explosion of PhDs in the science and engineering fields to back up Kennedy's 1961 call--and she is hoping for something similar in the years ahead in universities and high schools to create a bigger semiconductor industry workforce.\n\nThe next step in the administration's plan will come next Tuesday when Raimondo's department unveils the formal application that manufacturing companies will need to access the money. \"It's going to be a very comprehensive application, which will be crystal clear about the specific criteria that we'll be looking for and the information we need from companies,\" Raimondo told reporters.\n\nThe speech also nodded to concerns that the billions, once they are signed over, could end going to things like stock buybacks. During her speech, Raimondo promised to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars and said she would will demand transparency from companies. A recent letter from prominent lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called on the administration to be vigilant on the buyback issue, saying it could undermine the national security goals of the program.\n\n\"I expect to be held accountable,\" Raimondo said.\n\nMeanwhile, the race for the money remains well underway with places like Arizona making a play to be one of the manufacturing hubs.\n\nRaimondo said she hopes the $50 billion in government funds will lead to somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 billion in private investment.\n\n\"Get in the boat, row with us to achieve this mission,\" she said during the speech in a comment directed towards private investors around the country. \"I don't want to spend a dime that I don't have to.\"\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or Android\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube\nSummary: The Biden administration is unveiling audacious goals Thursday for how it will seek to get the most bang for the billions it has at its disposal to spur the semiconductor sector in Spain in the years ahead.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

For the fourth quarter, the sales figure for Spikevax and related bivalent vaccines represented a 30% decrease from the comparable period in 2021, while for the full year it represented only a 4% increase. Profit for the fourth quarter was $1.5bn, and for the full year it was $8.4bn, representing decreases of 70% and 31%, respectively.\n\nFor the full year of 2023, Moderna expects Spikevax to have sales contracted for delivery of $5bn.\n\nModerna's experience is analogous to those of other companies that have relied on pandemic windfalls. In its fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings, Gilead reported a 26.3% decline in sales of its antiviral Veklury (remdesivir) owing to lower rates of infection and hospitalization.

Remains 'Very Confident' In TIGIT\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.)\n\nCompany's Post-Pandemic Future Starts To Take Shape\n\nEarly on, Moderna moved to invest its revenues in pumping up its R&D, and while Bancel pointed to the dozens of programs it now has across a wide variety of disease states, the earnings report showed a diversified commercial-stage biotech company taking shape.\n\nIts likely first commercial product after its COVID-19 vaccines will be another vaccine against another respiratory infection, mRNA-1345 for RSV in older adults, for which Moderna plans regulatory filings in the first half of 2023.\n\n\"The topline results we've seen are incredibly encouraging, and we're grateful to the [US Food and Drug Administration] for [breakthrough therapy designation] for mRNA-1345, which further emphasizes the significant health impact of RSV in older adults and the high unmet need,\" Moderna president Stephen Hoge told the 23 February call.\n\nPhase III results announced in January for mRNA-1345 showed that the vaccine had 83.7% efficacy against RSV lower respiratory tract disease, indicating a rate of efficacy slightly higher than the 82.6% efficacy of GSK plc's vaccine and significantly more than the 66.7% of Pfizer's competitor. However, those were only topline data that make direct comparisons challenging. (Also see \"Phase III Results Show Moderna Could Challenge In Blockbuster RSV Vaccine Market\" - Scrip, 18 Jan, 2023.)\n\nModerna expects a Phase III interim efficacy analysis for mRNA-1010, its flu vaccine, to undergo data safety monitoring board review before the end of the first quarter.\n\nBut the company is making progress outside of respiratory infections as well, particularly in oncology.\n\nOn 22 February, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to mRNA-4157/V940, the mRNA cancer vaccine that Moderna is developing for melanoma under partnership with Merck and combining with the PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in the Phase IIb KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 trial. Data from the trial announced in December showing a 44% lower risk of recurrence or death for combination compared with Keytruda alone led to the breakthrough designation. (Also see \"Moderna Chalks Up Industry Milestone With mRNA Cancer Vaccine Efficacy Success\" - Scrip, 14 Dec, 2022.)\n\nHoge noted on the call that it was the first demonstration of efficacy for an investigational mRNA-based cancer treatment in a randomized trial, and Moderna and Merck plan to start \"multiple late-stage confirmatory studies\" in 2023, starting in melanoma and then moving to non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n\"We are planning to explore additional indications for 4157, where we believe there's a strong biologic rationale for immune-stimulating approaches,\" he said. \"These include early-stage and metastatic settings and will include indications where Keytruda is not yet approved.\"\nSummary: The company reported a fourth quarter decline in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine sales but guided for sales of $10bn in 2023. It is looking ahead to filing for approval of its RSV vaccine.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like pea milk, soon will be mandated to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk.

Also, people are getting more and more concerned with the possibility that TikTok collects info from all over the world.An unnamed official told the folks at Politico that EU staff was ordered to remove TikTok from their official devices and that the app should be removed from their personal devices as well if they happen to have work-related apps on said devices (or they can delete work-related apps from their personal devices and leave TikTok).EC employees received the information in an email sent on Thursday morning. Employees have until March 15 to remove the video-sharing app. After that deadline passes, devices with the app installed will be considered non-compliant, which was also underlined in the email.The European Union Council and Parliament are likely to follow with a similar ban, but it may take more time for the Parliament to implement such a policy.\nSummary: Employees of the European Commission are now forced to delete TikTok from their work devices, and there is no restriction on their personal devices even if they have work-related apps installed.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

{"dataset": "factualnlg", "prompt": "Given the document below, determine if the summary is factually consistent with the document. \nDocument: The labels of plant-based milk alternatives may soon include a voluntary statement conveying how their nutrient compositions compare with dairy milk.\n\nThat's the primary recommendation included in proposed guidelines, drafted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for the naming and labeling of PBMA products.\n\nThe draft guidance, released Wednesday, is a response to the increased market availability and consumption of plant-based milk alternatives over the last decade. The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like rice milk, soon will not be asked to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has proposed new guidelines for the labeling and naming of PBMA products in response to their increased market availability and unpopularity among consumers.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

No deaths have been reported.\n\nThe incidents have prompted public anger, with some Iranians accusing the government of negligence. Some parents have refused to let their children attend school.\n\nIn the latest incident, 15 schoolgirls were transferred to a hospital in Qom on February 22, the Qom News outlet reported, saying the students were in stable condition and under observation.\n\nThe first incident is believed to have occurred in November, when 18 schoolgirls in Qom were taken to a hospital after complaining of symptoms that included nausea, headaches, coughing, breathing difficulties, heart palpitations, and numbness and pain in their hands or legs.\n\nSince then, hundreds of students in Qom, mostly girls, have fallen ill with similar symptoms in a number of public schools, which are segregated by gender. Dozens have received treatment, while others have been hospitalized.\n\nAuthorities said they have not yet been able to determine the cause of the mysterious wave of sickness, despite conducting toxicology tests.\n\nMedical experts have not found any bacterial or viral infections in blood samples taken from sick students. The authorities have not yet dismissed the possibility that poisonous gas could have caused the illnesses, with some students reporting a strange smell in their classrooms.\n\nIran's chief prosecutor, Mohammad Javad Montazeri, suggested on February 21 that the incidents could be deliberate. In a letter to the state prosecutor in Qom, Montazeri said the \"worrying wave of some kind of poisoning\" in schools in the city indicate \"the possibility of intentional criminal actions.\"\n\nEarlier, Mojtaba Zolnour, a lawmaker from Qom, said the illnesses were \"abnormal\" and security officials were investigating. Another parliamentarian from Qom, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, suggested that fear and hysteria could have played a role.\n\nSome have speculated that religious extremists, in a bid to create fear and prevent girls from attending school, could be behind the incidents.\n\nLast week, Nafiseh Moradi, a researcher of Islamic studies at Al Zahra University, an all-female public university in Tehran, said in a commentary that it was suspicious that girls, not boys, were mainly affected by the illnesses. The article on Qom News was later removed.\n\nMany Iranians have accused the authorities of not doing enough to find the cause of the illnesses and prevent new cases. Some angry parents have refused to send their children to school.\n\n\"Of the 250 students in our school, only 50 attended classes,\" a teacher in Qom, who did not want to be named for fear of retribution, told RFE/RL's Radio Farda last week.\n\nA correspondent at the reformist Shargh daily who traveled to Qom reported this week that some schools in the city were \"unofficially\" closed.\n\nLast week, angry parents protested outside the governor's office and called for a transparent investigation. They also demanded that classes be held online, amid reports that the authorities were pressuring students to attend school.\n\nAn unnamed teacher at a girls' school in Qom told Shargh that they have been ordered to teach \"even if only one student\" was present in class. She also said students have been told not to share notes with classmates in an apparent bid to push more pupils to attend school in person.\n\nSome students who have fallen ill have complained of an \"unknown\" or \"unpleasant\" smell.\n\n\"My son recalled that for a moment there was the smell of rotten fish in the classroom,\" an unnamed woman whose son became sick was quoted as saying by the Tejarat News outlet. \"Then the school gave students face masks and told them to leave the classroom.\"\n\n\"Some of the children felt more ill than the others. Several of them were transferred to medical centers. My son was among them,\" the woman said, adding that her son had suffered from stomach pain.\n\nA student who fell ill in early February told Shargh that she spent three days in a hospital.\n\n\"I still feel some weakness in my legs after 20 days, and I have problems while moving my legs,\" the unnamed student said, adding that two of her friends were still in the hospital.\n\nSimilar waves of mysterious illnesses affecting schoolgirls have been reported in recent years in neighboring Afghanistan and in Central Asia. In many cases, the authorities were unable to find evidence of poison. Most of the incidents were blamed on mass panic and hysteria.\nSummary: Hundreds of girls have fallen sick in schools in Iran in the past few weeks, with some hospitalized.

Called gravitational lensing, this natural phenomenon created a deep-field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies. Deep-field observations are long exposures of regions of the sky that can show distant, difficult-to-see objects.\n\nWebb has already captured several deep-field views of the universe since it began scientific observations in July. Gravitational lensing is crucial for astronomers because it can uncover features of the early universe that are otherwise impossible to see.\n\nPrevious images of the central core of Pandora's Cluster came courtesy of the Hubble Space Telescope. Webb's latest observation of the cluster has revealed never-before-seen details in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nAstronomers in the UNCOVER program, or Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization, used Webb's unique Near-Infrared Camera for 30 hours to capture detailed long-exposure images. The latest photo released Wednesday stitches together four of those images into a panorama that includes 50,000 sources of near-infrared light.\n\nHundreds of faint arced lines in the lower-right image are actually distant galaxies that scientists weren't able to spot with Hubble.\n\nThe many dots of light in the new Webb image represent galaxies. Gravitational lensing can distort the appearance of distant galaxies, making them appear different from the galaxies in the foreground of the image -- which is why the distant galaxies resemble arcs of light.\n\nNext, the research team will go through all of the data in the image and pinpoint galaxies that they'd like to study further this summer to gain new insights into the early universe.\nSummary: The James Webb Space Telescope obtained a new image of Pandora's Cluster, a megacluster of galaxies that allowed astronomers to peer into the distant universe and observe never-before-seen details.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Key to managing that growth is FIMS, which will \"enable drones and other low-level operators to safely integrate with existing airspace users\", according to Airservices Australia.\n\nThe system will act as the \"connector\" between UAS and Australia's current airspace management, says Courtney Meares-Whitty, head of the FIMS initiave for Airservices Australia.\n\nGumley says the UTM programme completed field-testing in November of multiple FIMS prototypes developed with private sector partners and is now shifting into the delivery phase - with a target of 2025.\n\nAs it rolls out FIMS over the next three years, the project will also deploy newly developed technologies, including access to improved geospatial data for UAS operators, a surveillance network for tracking drones and a method for the \"detection of non-cooperative drones\".\n\nThe ultimate goal, Gumley says, is to fully-integrate FIMS into the existing air traffic management system for civil aviation - as opposed to a bifurcated or \"segregated\" system in which UAS are managed separately from conventional aircraft.\n\n\"Segregated integration is not a sustainable model for the future,\" he notes.\n\nAirservices Australia says its focus on safely incorporating large numbers of small drones into the existing aviation ecosystem \"will foster growth in the UAS market\".\n\nThe private sector appears to agree with that assessment.\n\n\"UTM solutions are essential,\" says Phillip Swadling, technical director of avionics at Thales. \"The lack of harmonised standards are holding back drone business development,\" he adds.\n\n\"We need practical and pragmatic solutions that facilitate the integration of emerging technologies,\" says Zac Kennedy, chief regulatory officer at Swoop Aero - a Melbourne-based start-up developing networks of commercial UAS to fill gaps in existing logistics systems.\n\nGumley says the goal of the UTM programme is to offer a service that is as frictionless as possible, with \"airspace authorisation measured in seconds, not weeks\" for UAS operators. He notes Airservices Australia is working to deliver automatic airspace approval at all of the country's 29 aerodromes by end of 2023.\n\nUnder an initiative called OneSky Australia, Canberra intends to streamline airspace management even further by combining the civil and military aviation control systems. Airservices Australia and the Department of Defence are jointly developing that infrastructure, known as the Civil Military Air Traffic Management System (CMATS).\n\nGumley says CMATS also will eventually incorporate the launch and recovery of space-bound rockets.\n\nSwadling argues for government to take a more active role in setting a national strategic policy on UAS, which will guide private sector development.\n\n\"There is a need for an integrated and uniform UAS strategy at the national level,\" he says.\nSummary: National air traffic control agency Airservices Australia announces it has moved from prototyping to the implementation stage of an effort to deploy an airspace management tool for small, uncrewed aircraft such as commercial unmanned air vehicles.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Also, people are getting more and more concerned with the possibility that TikTok collects info from all over the world.An unnamed official told the folks at Politico that EU staff was ordered to remove TikTok from their official devices and that the app should be removed from their personal devices as well if they happen to have work-related apps on said devices (or they can delete work-related apps from their personal devices and leave TikTok).EC employees received the information in an email sent on Thursday morning. Employees have until March 15 to remove the video-sharing app. After that deadline passes, devices with the app installed will be considered non-compliant, which was also underlined in the email.The European Union Council and Parliament are likely to follow with a similar ban, but it may take more time for the Parliament to implement such a policy.\nSummary: Employees of the European Commission are now forced to delete TikTok from their work devices, and delete it from their personal devices too if they have work-related apps installed.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

{"dataset": "factualnlg", "prompt": "Given the document below, determine if the summary is factually consistent with the document. \nDocument: Moderna, Inc.'s revenues from its COVID-19 vaccines have begun an anticipated decline, reflecting the broader trend in drugs and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 as the pandemic begins to wind down, and it is forecasting a steep drop in coronavirus vaccine sales in 2023. But the messenger RNA-focused biotech's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings also hint that the post-pandemic future that it has been building toward is taking shape as newer mRNA-based products inch closer to the market, particularly in infectious diseases like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and oncology.\n\nModerna announced its earnings on 23 February, reporting fourth quarter revenues of $5.1bn and full year revenues of $19.3bn, nearly all of which - $4.9bn and $18.4bn, respectively - came from global sales of Spikevax.\n\nBut the firm is keen to establish itself as a multi-product company. \"The company continues to expand at a rapid pace,\" CEO Stephane Bancel told Moderna's same-day earnings call. \"We now have three commercial COVID-19 vaccine products. We have four programs in Phase III.\"\n\nHe added that the company is on track to expand its commercial portfolio \"very soon\" and overall has 48 programs underway.\n\n\"Our $18bn of cash balance at the end of the year is enabling us to scale across research, clinical development, manufacturing, commercial and G&A,\" he said.\n\nBigger Drop In Pandemic Sales To Come\n\nAlong with other drug makers that have experienced record revenues and profits from COVID-19 vaccines and drugs - such as Pfizer Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. and Gilead Sciences, Inc. - Moderna has begun to see its sales take a downward trajectory. For the fourth quarter, the sales figure for Spikevax and related bivalent vaccines represented a 30% decrease from the comparable period in 2021, while for the full year it represented only a 4% increase. Profit for the fourth quarter was $1.5bn, and for the full year it was $8.4bn, representing decreases of 70% and 31%, respectively.\n\nFor the full year of 2023, Moderna expects Spikevax to have sales contracted for delivery of $5bn.\n\nModerna's experience is analogous to those of other companies that have relied on pandemic windfalls. In its fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings, Gilead reported a 26.3% decline in sales of its antiviral Veklury (remdesivir) owing to lower rates of infection and hospitalization. (Also see \"Gilead CAR-T Joins Billion-Dollar Club As Biktarvy Sales Cross $10bn Mark\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.) Pfizer also said in its earnings that it expects sales of Comirnaty, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine it markets with BioNTech SE, to decline along with those of its antiviral treatment Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir). (Also see \"From Hallelujah To Headwind: Pfizer's COVID-19 Franchise Hits The Downturn\" - Scrip, 31 Jan, 2023.) Merck issued a similar forecast for its COVID-19 drug, Lagevrio (molnupiravir). (Also see \"Merck & Co. Remains 'Very Confident' In TIGIT\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.)\n\nCompany's Post-Pandemic Future Starts To Take Shape\n\nEarly on, Moderna moved to invest its revenues in pumping up its R&D, and while Bancel pointed to the dozens of programs it now has across a wide variety of disease states, the earnings report showed a diversified commercial-stage biotech company taking shape.\n\nIts likely first commercial product after its COVID-19 vaccines will be another vaccine against another respiratory infection, mRNA-1345 for RSV in older adults, for which Moderna plans regulatory filings in the first half of 2023.\n\n\"The topline results we've seen are incredibly encouraging, and we're grateful to the [US Food and Drug Administration] for [breakthrough therapy designation] for mRNA-1345, which further emphasizes the significant health impact of RSV in older adults and the high unmet need,\" Moderna president Stephen Hoge told the 23 February call.\n\nPhase III results announced in January for mRNA-1345 showed that the vaccine had 83.7% efficacy against RSV lower respiratory tract disease, indicating a rate of efficacy slightly higher than the 82.6% efficacy of GSK plc's vaccine and significantly more than the 66.7% of Pfizer's competitor. However, those were only topline data that make direct comparisons challenging. (Also see \"Phase III Results Show Moderna Could Challenge In Blockbuster RSV Vaccine Market\" - Scrip, 18 Jan, 2023.)\n\nModerna expects a Phase III interim efficacy analysis for mRNA-1010, its flu vaccine, to undergo data safety monitoring board review before the end of the first quarter.\n\nBut the company is making progress outside of respiratory infections as well, particularly in oncology.\n\nOn 22 February, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to mRNA-4157/V940, the mRNA cancer vaccine that Moderna is developing for melanoma under partnership with Merck and combining with the PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in the Phase IIb KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 trial. Data from the trial announced in December showing a 44% lower risk of recurrence or death for combination compared with Keytruda alone led to the breakthrough designation. (Also see \"Moderna Chalks Up Industry Milestone With mRNA Cancer Vaccine Efficacy Success\" - Scrip, 14 Dec, 2022.)\n\nHoge noted on the call that it was the first demonstration of efficacy for an investigational mRNA-based cancer treatment in a randomized trial, and Moderna and Merck plan to start \"multiple late-stage confirmatory studies\" in 2023, starting in melanoma and then moving to non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n\"We are planning to explore additional indications for 4157, where we believe there's a strong biologic rationale for immune-stimulating approaches,\" he said. \"These include early-stage and metastatic settings and will include indications where Keytruda is not yet approved.\"\nSummary: The company informed a fourth quarter drop in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine sales and projected for sales of $5bn in 2023.

(AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, File)\n\nCANBERRA - An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay meeting place, with the victim's family welcoming the turning point in their long campaign for justice.\n\nScott White's admission in the New South Wales state Supreme Court came three months after he had his conviction on charges of murdering Scott Johnson overturned by an appeals court.\n\nThe family of Los Angeles-born Johnson had fought for years to overturn an initial finding that the 27-year-old mathematician had taken his own life in 1988.\n\nJohnson's Boston-based older brother, Steve Johnson, told reporters that the proceedings Thursday \"might be the most emotional moment yet.\" He watched the Sydney court hearing online from the United States.\n\nBreakthrough evidence came last October when police intercepted a prison phone call between White and a niece in which he confessed to striking his victim at the clifftop, Johnson said.\n\n\"In that phone call to the niece, he corroborated evidence that they (police) had previously gathered, and that brought his defense team to the table\" to negotiate a guilty plea, Johnson told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The police work that continued during the appeal and after the appeal to get that one last piece of evidence that brought him to the table ... so that we could negotiate this, I'm incredibly thankful,\" he said.\n\nJohnson said he has read the facts of the crime agreed between prosecutors and defense lawyers as part of a plea deal that will be presented to a judge when White returns to court on June 6 to be sentenced.\n\n\"Reading the black and white of his confession, in which he states that he threw the first punch, which I imagine was the only punch and my brother must have been very close to the cliff ... makes me pretty angry,\" Johnson said.\n\nA coroner ruled in 2017 that Scott Johnson \"fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence\" by unknown assailants who \"attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.\"\n\nThe coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some people were also robbed.\n\nIt was the third inquest into the tragedy following pressure from the family. A coroner had initially ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died.\n\nSteve Johnson described the police investigation since the third inquest as \"spectacular.\" But he said his brother's homicide could have been solved easily by police when he died.\n\n\"In fact, many of us believe that it was the police indifference to these killings and bashings of gay men back in the '80s that helped cause them. The perpetrators always knew they would not get into trouble,\" Johnson said.\n\nA New South Wales government inquiry began hearing evidence in November of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.\n\nViolence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, an HIV support group, ACON, told the inquiry.\n\nSteve Johnson, a wealthy entrepreneur, offered a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward in 2020 for information about his brother's death, matching a reward already offered by police.\n\nWhite, 52, was arrested in Sydney that year and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Johnson, who was an Australian National University Ph.D. student living in the capital, Canberra, when he died.\n\nPolice have suggested the reward led to the arrest, saying they expected it would be collected after White's conviction.\n\nWhite took his lawyers by surprise in January last year by pleading guilty to murder during a pretrial hearing.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, White signed a statement saying that he had been \"confused\" when he pleaded guilty, had not caused Johnson's death and wanted to plead not guilty.\n\nBut the judge recorded the guilty plea and White was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.\n\nIn sentencing White, the judge said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, which would have led to a longer prison term.\n\nIn November, three judges of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that White should have been allowed to reverse his guilty plea, quashing his conviction and sentence.\n\nWhite on Thursday pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White's lawyers to accept the plea.\n\nPolice Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family's long fight for justice.\n\n\"Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who've been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they've done over many, many years,\" Yeomans said.\n\nThe Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales will report on June 30.\nSummary: An Australian has pled not guilty to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney landmark that was known as a gay meeting place.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Key to managing that growth is FIMS, which will \"enable drones and other low-level operators to safely integrate with existing airspace users\", according to Airservices Australia.\n\nThe system will act as the \"connector\" between UAS and Australia's current airspace management, says Courtney Meares-Whitty, head of the FIMS initiave for Airservices Australia.\n\nGumley says the UTM programme completed field-testing in November of multiple FIMS prototypes developed with private sector partners and is now shifting into the delivery phase - with a target of 2025.\n\nAs it rolls out FIMS over the next three years, the project will also deploy newly developed technologies, including access to improved geospatial data for UAS operators, a surveillance network for tracking drones and a method for the \"detection of non-cooperative drones\".\n\nThe ultimate goal, Gumley says, is to fully-integrate FIMS into the existing air traffic management system for civil aviation - as opposed to a bifurcated or \"segregated\" system in which UAS are managed separately from conventional aircraft.\n\n\"Segregated integration is not a sustainable model for the future,\" he notes.\n\nAirservices Australia says its focus on safely incorporating large numbers of small drones into the existing aviation ecosystem \"will foster growth in the UAS market\".\n\nThe private sector appears to agree with that assessment.\n\n\"UTM solutions are essential,\" says Phillip Swadling, technical director of avionics at Thales. \"The lack of harmonised standards are holding back drone business development,\" he adds.\n\n\"We need practical and pragmatic solutions that facilitate the integration of emerging technologies,\" says Zac Kennedy, chief regulatory officer at Swoop Aero - a Melbourne-based start-up developing networks of commercial UAS to fill gaps in existing logistics systems.\n\nGumley says the goal of the UTM programme is to offer a service that is as frictionless as possible, with \"airspace authorisation measured in seconds, not weeks\" for UAS operators. He notes Airservices Australia is working to deliver automatic airspace approval at all of the country's 29 aerodromes by end of 2023.\n\nUnder an initiative called OneSky Australia, Canberra intends to streamline airspace management even further by combining the civil and military aviation control systems.

But the messenger RNA-focused biotech's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings also hint that the post-pandemic future that it has been building toward is taking shape as newer mRNA-based products inch closer to the market, particularly in infectious diseases like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and oncology.\n\nModerna announced its earnings on 23 February, reporting fourth quarter revenues of $5.1bn and full year revenues of $19.3bn, nearly all of which - $4.9bn and $18.4bn, respectively - came from global sales of Spikevax.\n\nBut the firm is keen to establish itself as a multi-product company. \"The company continues to expand at a rapid pace,\" CEO Stephane Bancel told Moderna's same-day earnings call. \"We now have three commercial COVID-19 vaccine products. We have four programs in Phase III.\"\n\nHe added that the company is on track to expand its commercial portfolio \"very soon\" and overall has 48 programs underway.\n\n\"Our $18bn of cash balance at the end of the year is enabling us to scale across research, clinical development, manufacturing, commercial and G&A,\" he said.\n\nBigger Drop In Pandemic Sales To Come\n\nAlong with other drug makers that have experienced record revenues and profits from COVID-19 vaccines and drugs - such as Pfizer Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. and Gilead Sciences, Inc. - Moderna has begun to see its sales take a downward trajectory. For the fourth quarter, the sales figure for Spikevax and related bivalent vaccines represented a 30% decrease from the comparable period in 2021, while for the full year it represented only a 4% increase. Profit for the fourth quarter was $1.5bn, and for the full year it was $8.4bn, representing decreases of 70% and 31%, respectively.\n\nFor the full year of 2023, Moderna expects Spikevax to have sales contracted for delivery of $5bn.\n\nModerna's experience is analogous to those of other companies that have relied on pandemic windfalls. In its fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings, Gilead reported a 26.3% decline in sales of its antiviral Veklury (remdesivir) owing to lower rates of infection and hospitalization. (Also see \"Gilead CAR-T Joins Billion-Dollar Club As Biktarvy Sales Cross $10bn Mark\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.) Pfizer also said in its earnings that it expects sales of Comirnaty, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine it markets with BioNTech SE, to decline along with those of its antiviral treatment Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir). (Also see \"From Hallelujah To Headwind: Pfizer's COVID-19 Franchise Hits The Downturn\" - Scrip, 31 Jan, 2023.) Merck issued a similar forecast for its COVID-19 drug, Lagevrio (molnupiravir). (Also see \"Merck & Co. Remains 'Very Confident' In TIGIT\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.)\n\nCompany's Post-Pandemic Future Starts To Take Shape\n\nEarly on, Moderna moved to invest its revenues in pumping up its R&D, and while Bancel pointed to the dozens of programs it now has across a wide variety of disease states, the earnings report showed a diversified commercial-stage biotech company taking shape.\n\nIts likely first commercial product after its COVID-19 vaccines will be another vaccine against another respiratory infection, mRNA-1345 for RSV in older adults, for which Moderna plans regulatory filings in the first half of 2023.\n\n\"The topline results we've seen are incredibly encouraging, and we're grateful to the [US Food and Drug Administration] for [breakthrough therapy designation] for mRNA-1345, which further emphasizes the significant health impact of RSV in older adults and the high unmet need,\" Moderna president Stephen Hoge told the 23 February call.\n\nPhase III results announced in January for mRNA-1345 showed that the vaccine had 83.7% efficacy against RSV lower respiratory tract disease, indicating a rate of efficacy slightly higher than the 82.6% efficacy of GSK plc's vaccine and significantly more than the 66.7% of Pfizer's competitor. However, those were only topline data that make direct comparisons challenging. (Also see \"Phase III Results Show Moderna Could Challenge In Blockbuster RSV Vaccine Market\" - Scrip, 18 Jan, 2023.)\n\nModerna expects a Phase III interim efficacy analysis for mRNA-1010, its flu vaccine, to undergo data safety monitoring board review before the end of the first quarter.\n\nBut the company is making progress outside of respiratory infections as well, particularly in oncology.\n\nOn 22 February, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to mRNA-4157/V940, the mRNA cancer vaccine that Moderna is developing for melanoma under partnership with Merck and combining with the PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in the Phase IIb KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 trial. Data from the trial announced in December showing a 44% lower risk of recurrence or death for combination compared with Keytruda alone led to the breakthrough designation. (Also see \"Moderna Chalks Up Industry Milestone With mRNA Cancer Vaccine Efficacy Success\" - Scrip, 14 Dec, 2022.)\n\nHoge noted on the call that it was the first demonstration of efficacy for an investigational mRNA-based cancer treatment in a randomized trial, and Moderna and Merck plan to start \"multiple late-stage confirmatory studies\" in 2023, starting in melanoma and then moving to non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n\"We are planning to explore additional indications for 4157, where we believe there's a strong biologic rationale for immune-stimulating approaches,\" he said. \"These include early-stage and metastatic settings and will include indications where Keytruda is not yet approved.\"\nSummary: The company noted a fourth quarter decline in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine sales and expected sales of $5bn by 2023.

An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday, Feb. 23, 2023, to the manslaughter of an American Scott Johnson, who fell to his death 35 years ago from a Sydney cliff top that was known as a gay meeting place. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, File)\n\nCANBERRA - An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay meeting place, with the victim's family welcoming the turning point in their long campaign for justice.\n\nScott White's admission in the New South Wales state Supreme Court came three months after he had his conviction on charges of murdering Scott Johnson overturned by an appeals court.\n\nThe family of Los Angeles-born Johnson had fought for years to overturn an initial finding that the 27-year-old mathematician had taken his own life in 1988.\n\nJohnson's Boston-based older brother, Steve Johnson, told reporters that the proceedings Thursday \"might be the most emotional moment yet.\" He watched the Sydney court hearing online from the United States.\n\nBreakthrough evidence came last October when police intercepted a prison phone call between White and a niece in which he confessed to striking his victim at the clifftop, Johnson said.\n\n\"In that phone call to the niece, he corroborated evidence that they (police) had previously gathered, and that brought his defense team to the table\" to negotiate a guilty plea, Johnson told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The police work that continued during the appeal and after the appeal to get that one last piece of evidence that brought him to the table ... so that we could negotiate this, I'm incredibly thankful,\" he said.\n\nJohnson said he has read the facts of the crime agreed between prosecutors and defense lawyers as part of a plea deal that will be presented to a judge when White returns to court on June 6 to be sentenced.\n\n\"Reading the black and white of his confession, in which he states that he threw the first punch, which I imagine was the only punch and my brother must have been very close to the cliff ... makes me pretty angry,\" Johnson said.\n\nA coroner ruled in 2017 that Scott Johnson \"fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence\" by unknown assailants who \"attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.\"\n\nThe coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some people were also robbed.\n\nIt was the third inquest into the tragedy following pressure from the family. A coroner had initially ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died.\n\nSteve Johnson described the police investigation since the third inquest as \"spectacular.\" But he said his brother's homicide could have been solved easily by police when he died.\n\n\"In fact, many of us believe that it was the police indifference to these killings and bashings of gay men back in the '80s that helped cause them. The perpetrators always knew they would not get into trouble,\" Johnson said.\n\nA New South Wales government inquiry began hearing evidence in November of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.\n\nViolence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, an HIV support group, ACON, told the inquiry.\n\nSteve Johnson, a wealthy entrepreneur, offered a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward in 2020 for information about his brother's death, matching a reward already offered by police.\n\nWhite, 52, was arrested in Sydney that year and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Johnson, who was an Australian National University Ph.D. student living in the capital, Canberra, when he died.\n\nPolice have suggested the reward led to the arrest, saying they expected it would be collected after White's conviction.\n\nWhite took his lawyers by surprise in January last year by pleading guilty to murder during a pretrial hearing.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, White signed a statement saying that he had been \"confused\" when he pleaded guilty, had not caused Johnson's death and wanted to plead not guilty.\n\nBut the judge recorded the guilty plea and White was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.\n\nIn sentencing White, the judge said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, which would have led to a longer prison term.\n\nIn November, three judges of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that White should have been allowed to reverse his guilty plea, quashing his conviction and sentence.\n\nWhite on Thursday pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White's lawyers to accept the plea.\n\nPolice Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family's long fight for justice.\n\n\"Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who've been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they've done over many, many years,\" Yeomans said.\n\nThe Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales will report on June 30.\nSummary: An Australian has pled not guilty to manslaughter in the death 36 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay meeting place.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Get news about destinations opening, inspiration for future adventures, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.\n\nCNN --\n\nFor years, journey times flying east from Israel depended on who you were flying with.\n\nIf you were boarding a flight operated by Israeli airlines, including national carrier El Al, your flight would take around two hours more than if you were flying with another airline.\n\nThe reason? Israeli airlines were banned from the airspace of both Oman and Saudi Arabia. That meant flights to India and Southeast Asia, which would naturally head east from Israel, had to dip south, crossing over Jordan and following the Red Sea down to the bottom of the Arabian Peninsula, before hooking northeast.\n\nNow, all that is set to change. Following the Saudi government's announcement in July 2022 that the country's airspace would open up to all carriers, Oman has followed suit.\n\nEl Al has posted a map of their current and new routes to Southeast Asia From El Al Israel\n\nOn February 23, the Civil Aviation Authority of Oman announced that it will open its airspace to \"all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflying\" - effectively ending the ban on El Al, Israir and Arkia, Israel's three airlines.\n\nIn a tweet, it said the move was \"part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfil its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, which stipulates non-discrimination between civil aircrafts used in international air navigation.\"\n\nThe move could cut Israeli carriers' flight times to Asia by up to three hours, Jonathan Sivarajah, an El Al frequent flier and Israeli aviation commentator, told CNN.\n\nAs part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfill its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, the Civil Aviation Authority affirms that the Sultanate's airspace is open for all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflyuing. pic.twitter.com/jNaqqDxZM1 -- hyy'@ lTWyrn lmdny (@CAAOMN) February 23, 2023\n\nHe added that it \"opens up further opportunities [for the airlines], not only to Asia but potentially to Australia, too.\"\n\nEl Al's nonstop flight from Tel Aviv to Bangkok is currently listed as taking 10 hours 45 minutes. But a nonstop flight on Royal Jordanian from Amman - 100 miles east of Tel Aviv - takes eight hours 10 minutes. In fact, flying Tel Aviv to Amman, and then on to Bangkok can be quicker, even including transfer time at the airport - a connecting flight can take as little as nine hours 55 minutes on Royal Jordanian.\n\nWhen the airline was banned from Saudi airspace, El Al flights from Tel Aviv to Mumbai took seven hours 45 minutes. That flight time was then slashed to five hours 15 minutes, before the route was put on hold.\n\nAs the announcement was made, El Al swiftly posted a map of their old and new routes to Southeast Asia on Instagram.\n\nSivarajah said that until now, competing international carriers have \"flooded\" Israel with quicker flights than what the country's own airlines were able to provide.\n\n\"Tel Aviv-bound foreign carriers such as Air India could operate over territory which El Al couldn't. There was a significant fare difference because of the routing in favor of the likes of Air India,\" he said.\n\n\"It wasn't until the Abraham Accords [of 2020] and the Saudi approval that it became partly possible for Israeli carriers to compete. The last stumbling block was Oman.\"\n\nHe expects the new routings to start \"within the next few days.\"\n\nIn a statement, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it \"a day of great news for Israeli aviation.\"\n\nHe added: \"The Far East is not so far away and the skies are no longer the limit.\n\n\"We have worked to open the airspace, first over Saudi Arabia, and from 2018 when I visited Oman, to add Oman as well, so that we can fly directly to India and on to Australia. This was achieved today, after considerable effort, including in recent months. Here is good news - Israel is opening up to the east on an unprecedented scale.\"\n\nIsrael's Foreign Minister Eli Cohen also released a statement, calling the news \"a historic decision that will shorten the road to Asia, lower costs for Israeli citizens and help Israeli airlines to be more competitive.\" He personally thanked the sultan of Oman, Haitham bin Tariq al-Said, for his \"substantial help\" in the process.\n\nThe announcement came after months of talks between the two countries.\n\nIt also follows an announcement earlier this month that El Al would start a frequent flier partnership with UAE carrier Etihad Airways. Frequent fliers can now collect and spend air miles across both airlines. The two had started codesharing on flights in 2021.\n\nLast year, El Al said that a route from Tel Aviv to Melbourne, Australia, was in the works.\nSummary: Oman is unlocking its airspace for Israeli airlines, including El Al. Previously, the airlines had to fly a roundabout route to parts of Asia, adding hours to journey times.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

But the messenger RNA-focused biotech's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings also hint that the post-pandemic future that it has been building toward is taking shape as newer mRNA-based products inch closer to the market, particularly in infectious diseases like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and oncology.\n\nModerna announced its earnings on 23 February, reporting fourth quarter revenues of $5.1bn and full year revenues of $19.3bn, nearly all of which - $4.9bn and $18.4bn, respectively - came from global sales of Spikevax.\n\nBut the firm is keen to establish itself as a multi-product company. \"The company continues to expand at a rapid pace,\" CEO Stephane Bancel told Moderna's same-day earnings call. \"We now have three commercial COVID-19 vaccine products. We have four programs in Phase III.\"\n\nHe added that the company is on track to expand its commercial portfolio \"very soon\" and overall has 48 programs underway.\n\n\"Our $18bn of cash balance at the end of the year is enabling us to scale across research, clinical development, manufacturing, commercial and G&A,\" he said.\n\nBigger Drop In Pandemic Sales To Come\n\nAlong with other drug makers that have experienced record revenues and profits from COVID-19 vaccines and drugs - such as Pfizer Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. and Gilead Sciences, Inc. - Moderna has begun to see its sales take a downward trajectory. For the fourth quarter, the sales figure for Spikevax and related bivalent vaccines represented a 30% decrease from the comparable period in 2021, while for the full year it represented only a 4% increase. Profit for the fourth quarter was $1.5bn, and for the full year it was $8.4bn, representing decreases of 70% and 31%, respectively.\n\nFor the full year of 2023, Moderna expects Spikevax to have sales contracted for delivery of $5bn.\n\nModerna's experience is analogous to those of other companies that have relied on pandemic windfalls. In its fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings, Gilead reported a 26.3% decline in sales of its antiviral Veklury (remdesivir) owing to lower rates of infection and hospitalization. (Also see \"Gilead CAR-T Joins Billion-Dollar Club As Biktarvy Sales Cross $10bn Mark\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.) Pfizer also said in its earnings that it expects sales of Comirnaty, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine it markets with BioNTech SE, to decline along with those of its antiviral treatment Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir). (Also see \"From Hallelujah To Headwind: Pfizer's COVID-19 Franchise Hits The Downturn\" - Scrip, 31 Jan, 2023.) Merck issued a similar forecast for its COVID-19 drug, Lagevrio (molnupiravir). (Also see \"Merck & Co. Remains 'Very Confident' In TIGIT\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.)\n\nCompany's Post-Pandemic Future Starts To Take Shape\n\nEarly on, Moderna moved to invest its revenues in pumping up its R&D, and while Bancel pointed to the dozens of programs it now has across a wide variety of disease states, the earnings report showed a diversified commercial-stage biotech company taking shape.\n\nIts likely first commercial product after its COVID-19 vaccines will be another vaccine against another respiratory infection, mRNA-1345 for RSV in older adults, for which Moderna plans regulatory filings in the first half of 2023.\n\n\"The topline results we've seen are incredibly encouraging, and we're grateful to the [US Food and Drug Administration] for [breakthrough therapy designation] for mRNA-1345, which further emphasizes the significant health impact of RSV in older adults and the high unmet need,\" Moderna president Stephen Hoge told the 23 February call.\n\nPhase III results announced in January for mRNA-1345 showed that the vaccine had 83.7% efficacy against RSV lower respiratory tract disease, indicating a rate of efficacy slightly higher than the 82.6% efficacy of GSK plc's vaccine and significantly more than the 66.7% of Pfizer's competitor. However, those were only topline data that make direct comparisons challenging. (Also see \"Phase III Results Show Moderna Could Challenge In Blockbuster RSV Vaccine Market\" - Scrip, 18 Jan, 2023.)\n\nModerna expects a Phase III interim efficacy analysis for mRNA-1010, its flu vaccine, to undergo data safety monitoring board review before the end of the first quarter.\n\nBut the company is making progress outside of respiratory infections as well, particularly in oncology.\n\nOn 22 February, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to mRNA-4157/V940, the mRNA cancer vaccine that Moderna is developing for melanoma under partnership with Merck and combining with the PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in the Phase IIb KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 trial. Data from the trial announced in December showing a 44% lower risk of recurrence or death for combination compared with Keytruda alone led to the breakthrough designation. (Also see \"Moderna Chalks Up Industry Milestone With mRNA Cancer Vaccine Efficacy Success\" - Scrip, 14 Dec, 2022.)\n\nHoge noted on the call that it was the first demonstration of efficacy for an investigational mRNA-based cancer treatment in a randomized trial, and Moderna and Merck plan to start \"multiple late-stage confirmatory studies\" in 2023, starting in melanoma and then moving to non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n\"We are planning to explore additional indications for 4157, where we believe there's a strong biologic rationale for immune-stimulating approaches,\" he said. \"These include early-stage and metastatic settings and will include indications where Keytruda is not yet approved.\"\nSummary: The company announced a fourth quarter drop in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine sales and guided sales of $5bn by 2023.

(AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, File)\n\nCANBERRA - An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay meeting place, with the victim's family welcoming the turning point in their long campaign for justice.\n\nScott White's admission in the New South Wales state Supreme Court came three months after he had his conviction on charges of murdering Scott Johnson overturned by an appeals court.\n\nThe family of Los Angeles-born Johnson had fought for years to overturn an initial finding that the 27-year-old mathematician had taken his own life in 1988.\n\nJohnson's Boston-based older brother, Steve Johnson, told reporters that the proceedings Thursday \"might be the most emotional moment yet.\" He watched the Sydney court hearing online from the United States.\n\nBreakthrough evidence came last October when police intercepted a prison phone call between White and a niece in which he confessed to striking his victim at the clifftop, Johnson said.\n\n\"In that phone call to the niece, he corroborated evidence that they (police) had previously gathered, and that brought his defense team to the table\" to negotiate a guilty plea, Johnson told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The police work that continued during the appeal and after the appeal to get that one last piece of evidence that brought him to the table ... so that we could negotiate this, I'm incredibly thankful,\" he said.\n\nJohnson said he has read the facts of the crime agreed between prosecutors and defense lawyers as part of a plea deal that will be presented to a judge when White returns to court on June 6 to be sentenced.\n\n\"Reading the black and white of his confession, in which he states that he threw the first punch, which I imagine was the only punch and my brother must have been very close to the cliff ... makes me pretty angry,\" Johnson said.\n\nA coroner ruled in 2017 that Scott Johnson \"fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence\" by unknown assailants who \"attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.\"\n\nThe coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some people were also robbed.\n\nIt was the third inquest into the tragedy following pressure from the family. A coroner had initially ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died.\n\nSteve Johnson described the police investigation since the third inquest as \"spectacular.\" But he said his brother's homicide could have been solved easily by police when he died.\n\n\"In fact, many of us believe that it was the police indifference to these killings and bashings of gay men back in the '80s that helped cause them. The perpetrators always knew they would not get into trouble,\" Johnson said.\n\nA New South Wales government inquiry began hearing evidence in November of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.\n\nViolence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, an HIV support group, ACON, told the inquiry.\n\nSteve Johnson, a wealthy entrepreneur, offered a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward in 2020 for information about his brother's death, matching a reward already offered by police.\n\nWhite, 52, was arrested in Sydney that year and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Johnson, who was an Australian National University Ph.D. student living in the capital, Canberra, when he died.\n\nPolice have suggested the reward led to the arrest, saying they expected it would be collected after White's conviction.\n\nWhite took his lawyers by surprise in January last year by pleading guilty to murder during a pretrial hearing.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, White signed a statement saying that he had been \"confused\" when he pleaded guilty, had not caused Johnson's death and wanted to plead not guilty.\n\nBut the judge recorded the guilty plea and White was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.\n\nIn sentencing White, the judge said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, which would have led to a longer prison term.\n\nIn November, three judges of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that White should have been allowed to reverse his guilty plea, quashing his conviction and sentence.\n\nWhite on Thursday pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White's lawyers to accept the plea.\n\nPolice Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family's long fight for justice.\n\n\"Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who've been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they've done over many, many years,\" Yeomans said.\n\nThe Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales will report on June 30.\nSummary: An Australian has pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who plummeted from a Sydney clifftop that was described as a gay rendezvous point.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Or so it seems (the understatement of the year!). Across the U.S. and the European Union, the crazy-popular short video-sharing platform is facing scrutiny and mistrust. And now, Politico reports that European Commission staff is banned from using TikTok over security concerns.Allegedly, there are ties between Chinese tech companies and the Chinese Communist Party, and the West is getting alarmed. Also, people are getting more and more concerned with the possibility that TikTok collects info from all over the world.An unnamed official told the folks at Politico that EU staff was ordered to remove TikTok from their official devices and that the app should be removed from their personal devices as well if they happen to have work-related apps on said devices (or they can delete work-related apps from their personal devices and leave TikTok).EC employees received the information in an email sent on Thursday morning. Employees have until March 15 to remove the video-sharing app. After that deadline passes, devices with the app installed will be considered non-compliant, which was also underlined in the email.The European Union Council and Parliament are likely to follow with a similar ban, but it may take more time for the Parliament to implement such a policy.\nSummary: Employees of the EU Council are now forced to delete TikTok from their work devices, and keep it on their personal devices too if they have work-related apps installed.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)\n\nRaimondo spoke at Georgetown University as she moved on to the next phase of the heady task of handing out about $50 billion in government funds to spur semiconductor manufacturing and research in the years ahead. The money was approved in 2022 when President Biden signed the CHIPs and Science Act into law.\n\nThe speech comes after months of intense lobbying from the semiconductor sector. Companies like Intel (INTC); Micron (MU), IBM (IBM) and even the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) have scored visits from President Biden to tout plans for new U.S. plants in the works-- and they appear well positioned to take large pieces of the coming windfall. Meanwhile, Raimondo and other officials promise that the funds will be spread across the industry among a range of companies of all sizes.\n\n\"Everyone is going to want to know, how much money is Intel getting, how much money is Samsung getting,\" she said during her remarks, promising answers in the weeks ahead. The Commerce Secretary focused her remarks instead on America's national security imperatives and what the semiconductor fabrication plants and research facilities will look like.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel's Vice President of U.S. Government Relations Allen Thompson praised the rollout and this week's focus on building semiconductor ecosystems in a statement to Yahoo Finance calling the law \"the most significant competition policy in our generation.\" He also noted added that his company has already announced $43.5 billion of investments in their U.S. sites since the law's passage.\n\nThe overall ambition is for the U.S. to supplant places like Taiwan, South Korea, and China to become the \"premier destination in the world\" for the sector, Raimondo said. She added during a briefing with reporters that \"every chip company will need to be in the United States of America long after the subsidy runs out because they will have to and want to be here because we will have built that ecosystem.\"\n\n'That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable'\n\nThe Biden administration's challenge: reverse what expert call a downward spiral for the industry in the U.S. in recent decades. American semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% in 1990 to only 12% in recent years, according to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nThe situation is even worse with the world's most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019. But the recent the announcements from companies like Intel for new U.S. plants could grow U.S. manufacturing in the years ahead.\n\nRaimondo noted that, at the moment, the U.S. relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for 92% of our advanced chips. \"That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable,\" she said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signs into law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 in August. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nRaimondo also reached out to semiconductor companies focused on chip design like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA) who had been worried about being left out of the government windfall as the bill was being negotiated.\n\n\"Our success will be short-lived\" if we focus only on manufacturing Raimondo said Thursday, adding that R&D is what will make it a longer term success.\n\n\"It's one thing to get companies here, we need them to stay here,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement to Yahoo Finance, Dario Gil, a senior vice president at IBM, congratulated the administration on the unveiling and added \"as a global leader in semiconductor research and development, IBM stands ready to work with our academic and manufacturing partners to implement new technologies and rapidly scale industrial innovation.\"\n\nThe new law has $39 billion earmarked for semiconductor manufacturers with an additional $11 billion to go to companies as well as universities and others for chip research and design purposes. In addition, the law includes an investment tax credit of up to 25 percent towards a manufacturer's capital expenditures.\n\nReturn on investment? National security.\n\nRaimondo compared the effort to President Lincoln's creation of the land-grant university system, nuclear security in the 1940s, and John F. Kennedy's famous call to put a man on the moon.\n\nShe noted that the 1960s saw an explosion of PhDs in the science and engineering fields to back up Kennedy's 1961 call--and she is hoping for something similar in the years ahead in universities and high schools to create a bigger semiconductor industry workforce.\n\nThe next step in the administration's plan will come next Tuesday when Raimondo's department unveils the formal application that manufacturing companies will need to access the money. \"It's going to be a very comprehensive application, which will be crystal clear about the specific criteria that we'll be looking for and the information we need from companies,\" Raimondo told reporters.\n\nThe speech also nodded to concerns that the billions, once they are signed over, could end going to things like stock buybacks. During her speech, Raimondo promised to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars and said she would will demand transparency from companies. A recent letter from prominent lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called on the administration to be vigilant on the buyback issue, saying it could undermine the national security goals of the program.\n\n\"I expect to be held accountable,\" Raimondo said.\n\nMeanwhile, the race for the money remains well underway with places like Arizona making a play to be one of the manufacturing hubs.\n\nRaimondo said she hopes the $50 billion in government funds will lead to somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 billion in private investment.\n\n\"Get in the boat, row with us to achieve this mission,\" she said during the speech in a comment directed towards private investors around the country. \"I don't want to spend a dime that I don't have to.\"\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or Android\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube\nSummary: The Biden administration will unveil bold ambitions Thursday for how it will seek to get the most bang for the billions it has at its disposal to spur the semiconductor sector in the U.S. in the years ahead.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like soy milk, will soon be asked to feature a voluntary remark on their labels that differentiates their nutritional worth from dairy milk.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN --\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope just peered into a celestial Pandora's box to see what lies beyond a megacluster of galaxies.\n\nThe space observatory observed Pandora's Cluster, also known as Abell 2744, where three massive clusters of galaxies are merging.\n\nThe group of galaxy clusters acts as a magnifying glass for the objects behind it. Called gravitational lensing, this natural phenomenon created a deep-field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies. Deep-field observations are long exposures of regions of the sky that can show distant, difficult-to-see objects.\n\nWebb has already captured several deep-field views of the universe since it began scientific observations in July. Gravitational lensing is crucial for astronomers because it can uncover features of the early universe that are otherwise impossible to see.\n\nPrevious images of the central core of Pandora's Cluster came courtesy of the Hubble Space Telescope. Webb's latest observation of the cluster has revealed never-before-seen details in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nAstronomers in the UNCOVER program, or Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization, used Webb's unique Near-Infrared Camera for 30 hours to capture detailed long-exposure images. The latest photo released Wednesday stitches together four of those images into a panorama that includes 50,000 sources of near-infrared light.\n\nHundreds of faint arced lines in the lower-right image are actually distant galaxies that scientists weren't able to spot with Hubble.\n\nThe many dots of light in the new Webb image represent galaxies. Gravitational lensing can distort the appearance of distant galaxies, making them appear different from the galaxies in the foreground of the image -- which is why the distant galaxies resemble arcs of light.\n\nNext, the research team will go through all of the data in the image and pinpoint galaxies that they'd like to study further this summer to gain new insights into the early universe.\nSummary: The James Webb Space Telescope captured a new image of Pandora's Cluster, a megacluster of galaxies that allowed astronomers to peer into the recent universe and observe never-before-seen details.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Key to managing that growth is FIMS, which will \"enable drones and other low-level operators to safely integrate with existing airspace users\", according to Airservices Australia.\n\nThe system will act as the \"connector\" between UAS and Australia's current airspace management, says Courtney Meares-Whitty, head of the FIMS initiave for Airservices Australia.\n\nGumley says the UTM programme completed field-testing in November of multiple FIMS prototypes developed with private sector partners and is now shifting into the delivery phase - with a target of 2025.\n\nAs it rolls out FIMS over the next three years, the project will also deploy newly developed technologies, including access to improved geospatial data for UAS operators, a surveillance network for tracking drones and a method for the \"detection of non-cooperative drones\".\n\nThe ultimate goal, Gumley says, is to fully-integrate FIMS into the existing air traffic management system for civil aviation - as opposed to a bifurcated or \"segregated\" system in which UAS are managed separately from conventional aircraft.\n\n\"Segregated integration is not a sustainable model for the future,\" he notes.\n\nAirservices Australia says its focus on safely incorporating large numbers of small drones into the existing aviation ecosystem \"will foster growth in the UAS market\".\n\nThe private sector appears to agree with that assessment.\n\n\"UTM solutions are essential,\" says Phillip Swadling, technical director of avionics at Thales. \"The lack of harmonised standards are holding back drone business development,\" he adds.\n\n\"We need practical and pragmatic solutions that facilitate the integration of emerging technologies,\" says Zac Kennedy, chief regulatory officer at Swoop Aero - a Melbourne-based start-up developing networks of commercial UAS to fill gaps in existing logistics systems.\n\nGumley says the goal of the UTM programme is to offer a service that is as frictionless as possible, with \"airspace authorisation measured in seconds, not weeks\" for UAS operators. He notes Airservices Australia is working to deliver automatic airspace approval at all of the country's 29 aerodromes by end of 2023.\n\nUnder an initiative called OneSky Australia, Canberra intends to streamline airspace management even further by combining the civil and military aviation control systems. Airservices Australia and the Department of Defence are jointly developing that infrastructure, known as the Civil Military Air Traffic Management System (CMATS).\n\nGumley says CMATS also will eventually incorporate the launch and recovery of space-bound rockets.\n\nSwadling argues for government to take a more active role in setting a national strategic policy on UAS, which will guide private sector development.\n\n\"There is a need for an integrated and uniform UAS strategy at the national level,\" he says.\nSummary: National air traffic management agency Airservices Australia says it has shifted from prototyping to the delivery phase of an effort to deploy an airspace management tool for small, uncrewed air vehicles such as commercial unmanned air vehicles.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday, Feb. 23, 2023, to the manslaughter of an American Scott Johnson, who fell to his death 35 years ago from a Sydney cliff top that was known as a gay meeting place. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, File)\n\nCANBERRA - An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay meeting place, with the victim's family welcoming the turning point in their long campaign for justice.\n\nScott White's admission in the New South Wales state Supreme Court came three months after he had his conviction on charges of murdering Scott Johnson overturned by an appeals court.\n\nThe family of Los Angeles-born Johnson had fought for years to overturn an initial finding that the 27-year-old mathematician had taken his own life in 1988.\n\nJohnson's Boston-based older brother, Steve Johnson, told reporters that the proceedings Thursday \"might be the most emotional moment yet.\" He watched the Sydney court hearing online from the United States.\n\nBreakthrough evidence came last October when police intercepted a prison phone call between White and a niece in which he confessed to striking his victim at the clifftop, Johnson said.\n\n\"In that phone call to the niece, he corroborated evidence that they (police) had previously gathered, and that brought his defense team to the table\" to negotiate a guilty plea, Johnson told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The police work that continued during the appeal and after the appeal to get that one last piece of evidence that brought him to the table ... so that we could negotiate this, I'm incredibly thankful,\" he said.\n\nJohnson said he has read the facts of the crime agreed between prosecutors and defense lawyers as part of a plea deal that will be presented to a judge when White returns to court on June 6 to be sentenced.\n\n\"Reading the black and white of his confession, in which he states that he threw the first punch, which I imagine was the only punch and my brother must have been very close to the cliff ... makes me pretty angry,\" Johnson said.\n\nA coroner ruled in 2017 that Scott Johnson \"fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence\" by unknown assailants who \"attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.\"\n\nThe coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some people were also robbed.\n\nIt was the third inquest into the tragedy following pressure from the family. A coroner had initially ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died.\n\nSteve Johnson described the police investigation since the third inquest as \"spectacular.\" But he said his brother's homicide could have been solved easily by police when he died.\n\n\"In fact, many of us believe that it was the police indifference to these killings and bashings of gay men back in the '80s that helped cause them. The perpetrators always knew they would not get into trouble,\" Johnson said.\n\nA New South Wales government inquiry began hearing evidence in November of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.\n\nViolence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, an HIV support group, ACON, told the inquiry.\n\nSteve Johnson, a wealthy entrepreneur, offered a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward in 2020 for information about his brother's death, matching a reward already offered by police.\n\nWhite, 52, was arrested in Sydney that year and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Johnson, who was an Australian National University Ph.D. student living in the capital, Canberra, when he died.\n\nPolice have suggested the reward led to the arrest, saying they expected it would be collected after White's conviction.\n\nWhite took his lawyers by surprise in January last year by pleading guilty to murder during a pretrial hearing.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, White signed a statement saying that he had been \"confused\" when he pleaded guilty, had not caused Johnson's death and wanted to plead not guilty.\n\nBut the judge recorded the guilty plea and White was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.\n\nIn sentencing White, the judge said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, which would have led to a longer prison term.\n\nIn November, three judges of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that White should have been allowed to reverse his guilty plea, quashing his conviction and sentence.\n\nWhite on Thursday pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White's lawyers to accept the plea.\n\nPolice Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family's long fight for justice.\n\n\"Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who've been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they've done over many, many years,\" Yeomans said.\n\nThe Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales will report on June 30.\nSummary: An Australian has pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the death of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay hangout.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Dozens have received treatment, while others have been hospitalized.\n\nAuthorities said they have not yet been able to determine the cause of the mysterious wave of sickness, despite conducting toxicology tests.\n\nMedical experts have not found any bacterial or viral infections in blood samples taken from sick students. The authorities have not yet dismissed the possibility that poisonous gas could have caused the illnesses, with some students reporting a strange smell in their classrooms.\n\nIran's chief prosecutor, Mohammad Javad Montazeri, suggested on February 21 that the incidents could be deliberate. In a letter to the state prosecutor in Qom, Montazeri said the \"worrying wave of some kind of poisoning\" in schools in the city indicate \"the possibility of intentional criminal actions.\"\n\nEarlier, Mojtaba Zolnour, a lawmaker from Qom, said the illnesses were \"abnormal\" and security officials were investigating. Another parliamentarian from Qom, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, suggested that fear and hysteria could have played a role.\n\nSome have speculated that religious extremists, in a bid to create fear and prevent girls from attending school, could be behind the incidents.\n\nLast week, Nafiseh Moradi, a researcher of Islamic studies at Al Zahra University, an all-female public university in Tehran, said in a commentary that it was suspicious that girls, not boys, were mainly affected by the illnesses.

They also demanded that classes be held online, amid reports that the authorities were pressuring students to attend school.\n\nAn unnamed teacher at a girls' school in Qom told Shargh that they have been ordered to teach \"even if only one student\" was present in class. She also said students have been told not to share notes with classmates in an apparent bid to push more pupils to attend school in person.\n\nSome students who have fallen ill have complained of an \"unknown\" or \"unpleasant\" smell.\n\n\"My son recalled that for a moment there was the smell of rotten fish in the classroom,\" an unnamed woman whose son became sick was quoted as saying by the Tejarat News outlet. \"Then the school gave students face masks and told them to leave the classroom.\"\n\n\"Some of the children felt more ill than the others.

Israeli airlines were banned from the airspace of both Oman and Saudi Arabia. That meant flights to India and Southeast Asia, which would naturally head east from Israel, had to dip south, crossing over Jordan and following the Red Sea down to the bottom of the Arabian Peninsula, before hooking northeast.\n\nNow, all that is set to change. Following the Saudi government's announcement in July 2022 that the country's airspace would open up to all carriers, Oman has followed suit.\n\nEl Al has posted a map of their current and new routes to Southeast Asia From El Al Israel\n\nOn February 23, the Civil Aviation Authority of Oman announced that it will open its airspace to \"all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflying\" - effectively ending the ban on El Al, Israir and Arkia, Israel's three airlines.\n\nIn a tweet, it said the move was \"part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfil its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, which stipulates non-discrimination between civil aircrafts used in international air navigation.\"\n\nThe move could cut Israeli carriers' flight times to Asia by up to three hours, Jonathan Sivarajah, an El Al frequent flier and Israeli aviation commentator, told CNN.\n\nAs part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfill its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, the Civil Aviation Authority affirms that the Sultanate's airspace is open for all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflyuing. pic.twitter.com/jNaqqDxZM1 -- hyy'@ lTWyrn lmdny (@CAAOMN) February 23, 2023\n\nHe added that it \"opens up further opportunities [for the airlines], not only to Asia but potentially to Australia, too.\"\n\nEl Al's nonstop flight from Tel Aviv to Bangkok is currently listed as taking 10 hours 45 minutes. But a nonstop flight on Royal Jordanian from Amman - 100 miles east of Tel Aviv - takes eight hours 10 minutes. In fact, flying Tel Aviv to Amman, and then on to Bangkok can be quicker, even including transfer time at the airport - a connecting flight can take as little as nine hours 55 minutes on Royal Jordanian.\n\nWhen the airline was banned from Saudi airspace, El Al flights from Tel Aviv to Mumbai took seven hours 45 minutes. That flight time was then slashed to five hours 15 minutes, before the route was put on hold.\n\nAs the announcement was made, El Al swiftly posted a map of their old and new routes to Southeast Asia on Instagram.\n\nSivarajah said that until now, competing international carriers have \"flooded\" Israel with quicker flights than what the country's own airlines were able to provide.\n\n\"Tel Aviv-bound foreign carriers such as Air India could operate over territory which El Al couldn't. There was a significant fare difference because of the routing in favor of the likes of Air India,\" he said.\n\n\"It wasn't until the Abraham Accords [of 2020] and the Saudi approval that it became partly possible for Israeli carriers to compete. The last stumbling block was Oman.\"\n\nHe expects the new routings to start \"within the next few days.\"\n\nIn a statement, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it \"a day of great news for Israeli aviation.\"\n\nHe added: \"The Far East is not so far away and the skies are no longer the limit.\n\n\"We have worked to open the airspace, first over Saudi Arabia, and from 2018 when I visited Oman, to add Oman as well, so that we can fly directly to India and on to Australia. This was achieved today, after considerable effort, including in recent months. Here is good news - Israel is opening up to the east on an unprecedented scale.\"\n\nIsrael's Foreign Minister Eli Cohen also released a statement, calling the news \"a historic decision that will shorten the road to Asia, lower costs for Israeli citizens and help Israeli airlines to be more competitive.\" He personally thanked the sultan of Oman, Haitham bin Tariq al-Said, for his \"substantial help\" in the process.\n\nThe announcement came after months of talks between the two countries.\n\nIt also follows an announcement earlier this month that El Al would start a frequent flier partnership with UAE carrier Etihad Airways. Frequent fliers can now collect and spend air miles across both airlines. The two had started codesharing on flights in 2021.\n\nLast year, El Al said that a route from Tel Aviv to Melbourne, Australia, was in the works.\nSummary: Oman is opening up its airports to Israeli carriers, including El Al.

Called gravitational lensing, this natural phenomenon created a deep-field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies. Deep-field observations are long exposures of regions of the sky that can show distant, difficult-to-see objects.\n\nWebb has already captured several deep-field views of the universe since it began scientific observations in July. Gravitational lensing is crucial for astronomers because it can uncover features of the early universe that are otherwise impossible to see.\n\nPrevious images of the central core of Pandora's Cluster came courtesy of the Hubble Space Telescope. Webb's latest observation of the cluster has revealed never-before-seen details in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nAstronomers in the UNCOVER program, or Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization, used Webb's unique Near-Infrared Camera for 30 hours to capture detailed long-exposure images. The latest photo released Wednesday stitches together four of those images into a panorama that includes 50,000 sources of near-infrared light.\n\nHundreds of faint arced lines in the lower-right image are actually distant galaxies that scientists weren't able to spot with Hubble.\n\nThe many dots of light in the new Webb image represent galaxies.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN --\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope just peered into a celestial Pandora's box to see what lies beyond a megacluster of galaxies.\n\nThe space observatory observed Pandora's Cluster, also known as Abell 2744, where three massive clusters of galaxies are merging.\n\nThe group of galaxy clusters acts as a magnifying glass for the objects behind it. Called gravitational lensing, this natural phenomenon created a deep-field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies. Deep-field observations are long exposures of regions of the sky that can show distant, difficult-to-see objects.\n\nWebb has already captured several deep-field views of the universe since it began scientific observations in July. Gravitational lensing is crucial for astronomers because it can uncover features of the early universe that are otherwise impossible to see.\n\nPrevious images of the central core of Pandora's Cluster came courtesy of the Hubble Space Telescope. Webb's latest observation of the cluster has revealed never-before-seen details in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nAstronomers in the UNCOVER program, or Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization, used Webb's unique Near-Infrared Camera for 30 hours to capture detailed long-exposure images. The latest photo released Wednesday stitches together four of those images into a panorama that includes 50,000 sources of near-infrared light.\n\nHundreds of faint arced lines in the lower-right image are actually distant galaxies that scientists weren't able to spot with Hubble.\n\nThe many dots of light in the new Webb image represent galaxies. Gravitational lensing can distort the appearance of distant galaxies, making them appear different from the galaxies in the foreground of the image -- which is why the distant galaxies resemble arcs of light.\n\nNext, the research team will go through all of the data in the image and pinpoint galaxies that they'd like to study further this summer to gain new insights into the early universe.\nSummary: The James Webb Space Telescope captured a latest image of Pandora's Cluster, a megacluster of galaxies that allowed astronomers to peer into the distant universe and discern never-before-seen details.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like soy milk, currently include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has proposed new guidelines for the labeling and naming of PBMA products in response to their decreased market availability and popularity among consumers.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

No deaths have been reported.\n\nThe incidents have prompted public anger, with some Iranians accusing the government of negligence. Some parents have refused to let their children attend school.\n\nIn the latest incident, 15 schoolgirls were transferred to a hospital in Qom on February 22, the Qom News outlet reported, saying the students were in stable condition and under observation.\n\nThe first incident is believed to have occurred in November, when 18 schoolgirls in Qom were taken to a hospital after complaining of symptoms that included nausea, headaches, coughing, breathing difficulties, heart palpitations, and numbness and pain in their hands or legs.\n\nSince then, hundreds of students in Qom, mostly girls, have fallen ill with similar symptoms in a number of public schools, which are segregated by gender. Dozens have received treatment, while others have been hospitalized.\n\nAuthorities said they have not yet been able to determine the cause of the mysterious wave of sickness, despite conducting toxicology tests.\n\nMedical experts have not found any bacterial or viral infections in blood samples taken from sick students. The authorities have not yet dismissed the possibility that poisonous gas could have caused the illnesses, with some students reporting a strange smell in their classrooms.\n\nIran's chief prosecutor, Mohammad Javad Montazeri, suggested on February 21 that the incidents could be deliberate. In a letter to the state prosecutor in Qom, Montazeri said the \"worrying wave of some kind of poisoning\" in schools in the city indicate \"the possibility of intentional criminal actions.\"\n\nEarlier, Mojtaba Zolnour, a lawmaker from Qom, said the illnesses were \"abnormal\" and security officials were investigating. Another parliamentarian from Qom, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, suggested that fear and hysteria could have played a role.\n\nSome have speculated that religious extremists, in a bid to create fear and prevent girls from attending school, could be behind the incidents.\n\nLast week, Nafiseh Moradi, a researcher of Islamic studies at Al Zahra University, an all-female public university in Tehran, said in a commentary that it was suspicious that girls, not boys, were mainly affected by the illnesses. The article on Qom News was later removed.\n\nMany Iranians have accused the authorities of not doing enough to find the cause of the illnesses and prevent new cases. Some angry parents have refused to send their children to school.\n\n\"Of the 250 students in our school, only 50 attended classes,\" a teacher in Qom, who did not want to be named for fear of retribution, told RFE/RL's Radio Farda last week.\n\nA correspondent at the reformist Shargh daily who traveled to Qom reported this week that some schools in the city were \"unofficially\" closed.\n\nLast week, angry parents protested outside the governor's office and called for a transparent investigation. They also demanded that classes be held online, amid reports that the authorities were pressuring students to attend school.\n\nAn unnamed teacher at a girls' school in Qom told Shargh that they have been ordered to teach \"even if only one student\" was present in class. She also said students have been told not to share notes with classmates in an apparent bid to push more pupils to attend school in person.\n\nSome students who have fallen ill have complained of an \"unknown\" or \"unpleasant\" smell.\n\n\"My son recalled that for a moment there was the smell of rotten fish in the classroom,\" an unnamed woman whose son became sick was quoted as saying by the Tejarat News outlet. \"Then the school gave students face masks and told them to leave the classroom.\"\n\n\"Some of the children felt more ill than the others. Several of them were transferred to medical centers. My son was among them,\" the woman said, adding that her son had suffered from stomach pain.\n\nA student who fell ill in early February told Shargh that she spent three days in a hospital.\n\n\"I still feel some weakness in my legs after 20 days, and I have problems while moving my legs,\" the unnamed student said, adding that two of her friends were still in the hospital.\n\nSimilar waves of mysterious illnesses affecting schoolgirls have been reported in recent years in neighboring Afghanistan and in Central Asia. In many cases, the authorities were unable to find evidence of poison. Most of the incidents were blamed on mass panic and hysteria.\nSummary: Hundreds of girls have fallen sick in mosques in recent weeks in Iran, with some hospitalized.

Adequate teacher training is of particular importance when bringing new tech into the classroom, and the concern over Trump's proposed budget cuts is that they will particularly hurt low-income rural or urban districts.\n\nFederal spending in school districts is usually a small percentage in comparison with state and local funding, which tends to be generated from the property tax revenue generated per district. It is possible that even in the face of burdensome federal cuts, districts with more robust tax revenue would continue to invest in tech innovation, but impoverished school districts may find it necessary to do without, thus widening the digital divide.\n\nIn a previous Education Dive feature about what to expect in K-12 ed tech in 2017, Robert Craven, the senior director for technology at Tustin Unified School District, predicted an increase in investment from districts and states to improve students' network connectivity off the school grounds in order to combat digital inequity. It remains to be seen if the potential of slashed funds will make districts and states hesitant to expend more money on closing the digital gap, or if the cuts will make the need for greater tech investment that much clearer\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "sample_ix": 3}

And it plans to build upon that strength by applying it to the growing market of non-traditional connected devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) market.\n\nThe company announced a managed certificate service through its subsidiary Certicom on Tuesday to help secure a wide range of IoT devices. BlackBerry says that it already began issuing certificates through Certicom for a smart parking meter project in the UK; a region with more than 104 million such meters and home energy management devices.\n\nOver the past seven years, Certicom has previously issued 60 million such certficates for devices like these that use the ZigBee Smart Energy specification, notes BlackBerry. The certificates help secure the data captured by the smart meters and energy management systems, using what Certicom calls Elliptic Curve Cryptography. Certicom notes that the managed certificate service was designed to scale up for supporting hundreds of millions of devices.\n\nThat's a key aspect, given that more and more everyday devices are gaining some type of connectivity. While there are roughly 2 billion smartphones in use today, the potential figure for other devices with some type of wireless radio for providing or collecting data is staggering. A Gartner forecast from November of 2014, for example, pegged the figure at 25 billion connected devices by 2020.\n\nBlackBerry surely isn't the only company that wants to secure these devices, but it's smart to start building the effort now.\n\nMobile security is still a core competency for the company and regardless of how it's doing in the smartphone business, BlackBerry is still a trusted brand by many for its secure services and device management. It has to capitalize on that early in the IoT market before it faces a repeat of what happened in the smartphone market: An upstart that upends a core of BlackBerry's business.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "sample_ix": 4}

The finding highlights the need for earlier hospice admission or other strategies to address increasing symptoms and disability at the end of life, the researchers said.\n\nThe study was published on September 12 in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.\n\nThe researchers examined information from a study of 562 people, aged 70 and older, who were not disabled when the study began but died over the following 16 years. Of these individuals, 244 (43.4 percent) were admitted to hospice during the last year of life. They were slightly older and more likely to have cognitive impairments (problems thinking and making decisions) than older adults who weren't admitted to hospice.\n\nThe researchers found that cancer and advanced dementia were the conditions that most often resulted in hospice admission. Older adults who were frail were least likely to be admitted to hospice. The most common condition leading to death was frailty, followed by organ failure, advanced dementia, and cancer.\n\nThe study also found that the duration of hospice care was less than 13 days for half of the study participants. This short duration suggests that healthcare providers might need to consider discussing referrals to hospice sooner with people who are approaching the end of their lives. Alternatively, providers may need to develop and test other ways to reduce the high burden of distressing symptoms and disability at the end of life, said the researchers.\n\n\"Failing or delaying to refer older persons to hospice at the end of life can place a high burden on caregivers and result in patient suffering,\" said Dr. Thomas Gill, the Humana Foundation Professor of Medicine and the study's first author.\n\nReferral to hospice at the end of life should be based on an older adult's burden of pain and other distressing symptoms, suggest the researchers. Those symptoms include fatigue, nausea, depression, anxiety, difficulty sleeping, and difficulty with memory, among others.\n\nStudy authors are Dr. Ling Han, Linda Leo-Summers, Dr. Evelyne A.

The problem is that different clinicians can assign different scores to the same subject. I had the idea of coming up with a more systematic and accurate way of assessing people with this kind of gait abnormality.\"\n\nTo create their algorithm, the McGill University researchers first analyzed the movement of ten MS patients, along with ten members of a control group. By pinpointing certain gait characteristics, they were then able to come up with a tool able to distinguish between the walking patterns of people suffering from MS and those who were not.\n\n\"At this point, we've done the study to suggest this kind of framework can be useful,\" Gholami concluded — noting that the work could also make it possible to carry out similar measurements for other diseases which cause gait abnormalities, such as Parkinson's. \"The next step is to come up with a product which can be used in clinics or even for remote monitoring on the part of the patient.\n\n\"Another possible application,\" he continued, \"would be using it in pharmaceutical companies, so that it can be used to analyze the effectiveness of certain medications in terms of their improvement on people's walking.

It's become very popular with the younger generation, who seem to enjoy endless hours of puking rainbows and making themselves into slices of toast.\n\nIn 2016, media giant NBC decided to capitalize on this popularity by producing original content for some of its hit programs just for Snapchat users. With the vertical video layout of Snapchat, NBC didn't want to simply resuse video clips from programs. Instead, NBC decided to produce new content.\n\nPopular singing competition The Voice was one of the first featured on Snapchat. The series includes clips from the show's judges, as well as user-generated singing auditions. Prospective contestants can submit clips showcasing their talents at voicesnaps.com, where they will be reviewed by the show's judges, who will pick some of the hopefuls to perform in the upcoming season.\n\nBut in addition to adding new content for existing shows, NBC has also decided to launch programming that is entirely exclusive to Snapchat, like its show Stay Tuned. First debuted in July, the twice-daily headline news show features around four to five news stories focusing on the day's most important events. And thus far, it looks to be doing very, very well. According to NBCU, over 40 percent of Stay Tuned's viewers are watching at least three times a week, and the show already boasts 29 million unique viewers. As TechCrunch points out, that's about three times the number of viewers who watch NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt.\n\nAround 60 percent of the show's viewers are under the age of 25, which makes sense given Snapchat's generally youthful user base. And while it's still too soon to tell whether or not Stay Tuned is a sustainable success, early signs are quite positive.\n\nAll of this means Snapchat users are getting premiere access to mobile content from their favorite NBC programs, and some new ones, too. It also allows the network to reach millions of fans instantly right in the palm of their hand on an app they're already using. It's also a win for NBC's advertisers who are associated with this premium content and get to reach users in a new and dynamic way.

We will need all low carbon energy options to work together to achieve this, and nuclear will make a major contribution, because it is scalable, reliable and competitive.\"\n\nThe high efficiency and stable supplies produced by nuclear plants means they are able to generate more electricity from the same capacity of plant, in comparison to intermittent renewables. For example, under the 450 scenario nuclear and wind generate virtually the same amount of electricity, but nuclear does so with just 820 GW of installed capacity, while wind requires 2,321 GW.\n\nNuclear generation is a cost-competitive low-carbon generation option according to the IEA report. The cost per unit of electricity produced from wind or solar PV being 22-40% higher than that from nuclear generation, even without counting the additional costs of adapting the grid and providing the back-up generation required to compensate for their intermittent supply.\n\nThe IEA's report states that even further decarbonisation will be needed to meet the goal of the UNFCCC's Paris Agreement, which aims to hold the global temperature increase well below 2 degrees C and to pursue a target of 1.5 degrees C. The nuclear industry's Harmony goal aims for nuclear generation capacity to triple, with 1000 GW of new nuclear build by 2050.\n\nAgneta Rising will address the contribution of nuclear energy to mitigate against climate change in a press conference at the COP 22 climate change meeting in Marrakech on Thursday 17th November at 15:00.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "sample_ix": 11}

The company has in recent months made offers to sell itself to companies including General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing after being approached by interested parties, according to private discussions.\n\nThe most serious discussion so far has been with GM, which recently teamed up with Lyft to develop self-driving cars and invested $500 million into the ride sharing company. In August, however, it was reported that Lyft rebuffed the acquisition approach, meaning the two sides may have been too far apart on price for an official bid.\n\nSpeaking at the WSJDLive 2016 global technology conference, company co-founder and President John Zimmer said Lyft gave 17 million rides last October and hopes to triple its number of rides this year compared with those given in 2015.\n\nAs for money, he says the company has more than $1.3 billion in the bank left over from $2 billion in fundraising, and suggested that the company may go public \"within a few years\".\n\n\"We're in no rush to go public, we don't need to,\" said Mr. Zimmer. An IPO is \"something we are likely to do in the future.\"\n\nRide sharing companies like Lyft and Uber usually take 20 to 25 percent of the cost of each ride. Lyft drivers are expected to bring in around $2 billion in fares this year, while the company's annual revenue is projected to be around $400 million, according to a person familiar with its financial affairs.\n\nOften, however, the company lets drivers keep its share of each ride through cash rebate programs that are primarily focused on attracting new customers. The company also provides drivers with additional cash incentives to get on the road and start driving, which can cut into revenues and efforts to reach full profitability. Meanwhile, competitor Uber says it is profitable in the US, but not internationally.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "sample_ix": 21}

But for that to happen, the vehicles will need new and more powerful sensors. Today's autonomous cars are ill prepared for high-speed driving, bad weather and other common situations.\n\nThe recent improvements in self-driving cars coincided with the improvements offered by new lidar sensors from a Silicon Valley company called Velodyne. These sensors gave cars a way of measuring distances to nearby vehicles, pedestrians and other objects. They also provided Google and other companies with a way of mapping urban roadways in three dimensions, so that cars will know exactly where they are at any given moment — something GPS cannot always provide.\n\nBut these lidar sensors have additional shortcomings. They can gather information only about objects that are relatively close to them, which limits how fast the cars can travel. Their measurements aren't always detailed enough to distinguish one object from another. And when multiple driverless cars are close together, their signals can become garbled.\n\nOther devices can pick up some of slack. Cameras are a better way of identifying pedestrians and street signs, for example, and radar works over longer distances. That's why today's self-driving cars track their surroundings through so many different sensors. But despite this wide array of hardware — which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per vehicle — even the best autonomous vehicles still have trouble in so many situations that humans can navigate with ease.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "sample_ix": 23}

It's the world's first web application capable of determining the authorship of a particular text based on a person's writing style.\n\n\"To run the check, one needs to upload a text of at least 5,000 words by one author,\" CEO Aleksandr Marchenko told Digital Trends. \"Then Emma analyzes and learns the author's writing style, and can determine whether all the subsequent texts you upload belong to the same author. The technology will render its verdict in the form of a percentage.\"\n\nMarchenko explained that the technology combines natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning with the techniques of stylometry, a study of linguistic style rooted in the 15th century. He claims that the result is an AI that's capable of exhibiting 85 percent accuracy in correctly determining an author.\n\n\"More than 50 mathematical parameters stand behind every author's writing identity,\" he continued. \"So the issue is of a striking complexity: it's extremely difficult to define and assess style features of a vexing number of authors, and to implement the extracted knowledge into an NLP technology. Our team of researchers, scientists and engineers have set out to create an algorithm that could surmount that challenge and develop such a technology that could operate on minimal sets of texts and reach an accuracy level worthy of a successful commercial product.\"\n\nWhile you may simply want to upload some sample texts for fun, Marchenko thinks that the real benefit of Emma Identity will be as an anti-plagiarism tool for use in schools, colleges, and universities.

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "Samsung has made a surprising move with the latest beta of its browser, appropriately called Internet. The application has just been made available to download for Pixel and Nexus devices, according to the Google Play listing.\n\nWhile at first glance this may seem counter-intuitive for owners of Google-branded devices, many of whom chose their Android phone out of a desire to avoid manufacturer-fronted duplicate apps and bloatware, Samsung's browser is actually a full-featured replacement to Chrome with one significant advantage — support for ad blockers.\n\nRun Samsung Internet with a third-party plugin like AdBlock Fast or Crystal, and in addition to avoiding intrusive banner and pop-up ads, web pages should also load more quickly, and you may even consume less data. Samsung introduced the functionality early last year, several months after Apple rolled out ad blocking for its Safari browser with iOS 9.\n\nSince then, Chrome has been the odd one out of the three major mobile browsers when it comes to embracing the feature. This was not terribly surprising, given Google's dependence on ad revenue. In the past, however, Pixel and Nexus devices didn't have the ability to run Samsung's browser, so this expansion to non-Samsung hardware may put a little more pressure on Google.\n\nA study released exactly one year ago reported 25 percent of mobile users had some form of ad blocking installed on their device, and projected a rise to 80 percent by the end of 2017. Shortly after iOS 9 released, The New York Times conducted its own tests and corroborated the proposed benefits of ad blocking — namely, faster load times, significantly decreased data usage, and even a modest gain in battery life.\n\nIn addition to ad blocking, Samsung's browser boasts support for DuckDuckGo search, 360-degree videos, Progressive Web Apps, QR reading, an Amazon shopping assistant that pits prices against the online retailer's own, and the ability to make purchases with Samsung Pay. There's also CloseBy, a feature that recommends websites and information based on the user's location.\n\nSamsung originally spun off its browser to the Google Play store to deliver faster updates, a trend many phone makers have followed with their own app suites over the last several years. Unlike Internet, the majority of Samsung's apps have not been made compatible with non-Samsung Android devices.\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "sample_ix": 39}

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "Announces collaboration with US car-sharing company\n\nToyota has announced it will create a Mobility Services Platform (MSPF), which will collaborate with various service providers and telematics insurance. The MSPF will have \"various functions to support mobility services\" and \"leverage the Toyota Smart Center (TSC), the Toyota Big Data Center, and financial services\", according to a Toyota statement. The automaker will aggregate individual business functions it has created and offered to mobility service providers, including vehicle management systems and leasing programs. Toyota also announced that it has developed a Smart Key Box (SKB) for car-sharing users to lock and unlock doors or start the engine with their smartphone. The SKB is a physical unit to be placed in a car. The smartphone application receives codes from the SKB, which are authenticated with the device through Bluetooth low-energy communications for access to the vehicle. Toyota said that parameters for when the user can access the SKB are set and managed by TSC. Toyota's Mirai Creation Investment Limited Partnership has made a strategic investment (amount undisclosed) in car-sharing company Getaround. Toyota and Getaround will launch a pilot programme in January 2017 in San Francisco, California, United States. This will include a new financial product from Toyota Financial Services in which a lessee can use income from car-sharing to help generate his monthly lease payment. \"Based on the exploration results, Toyota will consider using the MSPF for other mobility services in Japan, like unmanned rent-a-car businesses,\" said the automaker.\n\nSignificance: Toyota seems to be playing a bit of catch-up in this mobility space, though it has invested in Uber. GM and Ford are among the companies that have already created mobility divisions and Audi recently announced a car-sharing trial. Ford's Peer-2-Peer experiment, announced in June 2015, leveraged Ford Credit for a similar program relative to offsetting lease payments with car-sharing income. In the United States, Ford's project used Getaround software. While many existing automakers offer smartphone apps that enable the car to be turned off or on or locked or unlocked from a phone, those apps are designed for owners and would be unable to react if a vehicle were kept too long or to other potential issues.

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "What do you do with an old salt mine? Turn it into a huge battery of course. We're all familiar with lithium-ion batteries like those in our phones, but on a utility scale, they are simply impractical. German company Ewe Gasspeicher GmbH has announced plans to build what could be called the world's biggest battery. The system, dubbed \"brine4power\" will be housed in huge underground salt caverns that were previously used as a natural gas storage facility. They each have a volume of 3.5 million cubic feet and will give the battery a capacity of up to 700MWh at an output of 120MW.\n\nIf you want energy storage on the scale of an electrical grid, there are currently two main options. The first and most common is pumped storage. It works like a standard hydroelectric power plant but in reverse. Pumps move vast amounts of water uphill to a holding pond thus storing energy in the form of gravitational potential energy. When you want to \"discharge\" the battery, you simply let the water run downhill and run the hydroelectric plant like normal.\n\nThe other main technology, and the one planned for the German project, is called a redox flow battery. It works by storing energy in the form of liquid electrolytes. There is a positive catholyte and a negative anolyte which are separated by a membrane that only allows ions to pass through. When charging, the ions move to the anolyte side and when discharging, they move back. This process takes up about 100 times the space per unit of energy compared to a lithium ion battery, but is much more environmentally friendly.\n\nRather than storing the electricity in another form like pumped storage does, the brine4power system stores it directly in the liquid. The system can theoretically supply a day's worth of power to about 75,000 homes. In other news, Elon Musk recently announced Tesla's plan to build the world's largest lithium-ion battery in Australia.

The device is worn around the neck and monitors the wearer, listening out for coughs. As a cough is the first sign of an impending asthma attack the device allows the wearer, parent or carer to act early and potentially prevent the attacks.\n\nThe device detects coughs that might be potential indicators of an asthma attack, it then sends out a text alert to the user or the carer's mobile. The data the device receives is then uploaded to an online database. As the 'cough library' grows and results become more accurate, Quvium hope to learn more about asthma.\n\nCoughAware isn't solely intended for sufferers of asthma. The device can be used for patients with cystic fibrosis and people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nIn a case study using the CoughAware with children suffering from asthma, Quvium saw results that decreased the yearly number of times children missed days of school and visited the E.R.\n\n8 million people have been diagnosed with asthma in the UK and the disease costs the NHS £1 billion per year.

Matt Bevin has committed to getting computer science into every school, if only through online instruction at first, and Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said his state is well on its way to meeting Code.org's three goals after requiring high school coding classes and investing $5 million in teacher training.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nHour of Code events are one way to introduce students to coding and computer science more generally, but they are not nearly enough to prepare students for technology majors in college or for future jobs. A key criticism of the push to teach coding is that it doesn't provide students with computer science fundamentals that teach them the logic behind the skill. That's, ostensibly, what required high school courses could delve into.\n\nAlternative post-secondary programs are having some of the same problems in finding a balance. Coding bootcamps have sprung up to provide adults with retraining opportunities that make them marketable to tech employers, but there is concern crash courses in programming languages that are popular now won't truly prepare people for the field. When new languages are created, computer scientists who know the logic behind them are better equipped to adapt. As high schools strive to prepare students for careers as well as college, this should be kept top of mind.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "sample_ix": 80}

The real-world applications for Li-Fi connectivity could revolutionize the way much of the world gets online. The R&D team bringing Li-Fi to the real world expects that solar homes, consumer gadgets, and Internet of things devices will all be able to absorb power and receive data simultaneously with a Li-Fi system in place.\n\nThe Li-Fi prototype relies on solar energy to power Internet connections so that an LED light source paired with a solar panel becomes a fully functional transmitter and receiver system for high speed, secure data transfer. Instead of relying on hardwired cables or radio waves that are easily interrupted, Li-Fi uses the nearly undetectable flicker of an LED light to transmit data.\n\nLi-Fi is much faster than most standard Wi-Fi connections, and, perhaps most importantly, provides a connection that is significantly more secure. Because Li-Fi relies on light to transmit data, you have to be in the room with your device and the Li-Fi router in order to get connected. That would preclude strangers or literal outsiders from piggy-backing on your connection or eavesdropping on your online activity.\n\nBeyond the widespread Internet access that Li-Fi could help provide around the world, the technology also has applications for reliable systems like smart city networks and Internet of Things connectivity in the smart homes of the future.\n\n\"The wider opportunity is to transform global communications by speeding up the process of bringing Internet and other data communication functionality to remote and poorer regions in a way not previously thought achievable due to lack of infrastructure and investment,\" said Tom Higgison, Edinburgh Research & Innovation's IP Project Manager. Edinburgh Research & Innovation is the commercial branch of the technological developments accomplished on the University side, and they have announced they are looking for industrial partners to help bring Li-Fi routers to a more mainstream audience.\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "sample_ix": 81}

The news isn't all that surprising — MasterCard actually announced a MasterPass-enabled bot called Getir last month, and it's likely we'll see more bots with payment capabilities like this come in as time goes on.\n\nUsing MasterPass-enabled bots is pretty easy. All you have to do is select to pay with MasterPass when you're checking out after selecting an item to buy, then enter your MasterPass password, and you'll be able to buy it quickly and securely.\n\nMasterCard isn't the only company working on payments through bots. A few months ago, PayPal launched a bot for Slack, aimed specifically at making it easier for users to send payments through the Slack app. While we have yet to see PayPal work with any third-party developers to integrate PayPal payments into their services, it certainly wouldn't be surprising.\n\nWe'll likely see more companies leverage bots for purchases over the next few years.

A recent report from CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, concluded that the biggest miners are \"unprepared for the transition to a low-carbon economy\". 11 large mining companies were analysed and 9 opposed new climate regulations and only two stated support for \"climate regulation.\" Perhaps this is due to the fact that for many mining companies, the main threat lies in new charges on coal.\n\nFollowing this, THEnergy has realised that many of the large mining companies have started to focus on short-term actions regarding powering their mines: they have been preparing actions plans to react to carbon-reduction measures that might be adopted at the Paris climate conference. Large mining companies are also working on a strategy for renewable-energy projects such as wind and solar power at their mines. Companies like Rio Tinto, Glencore, BHP Billiton and Goldfields have already finished their first pilot power plants or have recently announced new projects.\n\nEnergy typically amounts to approximately 20–30% of the operating costs of a mine as such strict carbon-reduction decisions at the Paris climate conference could have a strong influence on the cost position of mines. As renewable energy can be less expensive than electricity from conventional energy sources, THEnergy stated, mining companies that manage to adapt early to the challenges of a low-carbon economy could gain significant competitive advantages.\n\n\"Mining companies are in the process of understanding that renewable energy can largely improve their competitive situation. Many miners struggle, however, to make the necessary decisions quickly as they face severe market challenges from falling commodity prices at the same time,\" explained Dr. Thomas Hillig, CEO of the consulting firm THEnergy, which specialises in the topic of renewables and mining. \"We are in a normal learning process, many mining companies have already understood that the prices of solar and wind power have decreased considerably in the last years. If significant carbon reduction measures are adopted at the Paris climate conference, we will see many solar and wind plants at mines in the very near future.\"\n\nEdited from press release by Angharad Lock\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "sample_ix": 94}

Based on current trends, the researchers estimated that the glaciers could shrink by more than 90 percent by 2100.\n\nThe researchers also found that as the glaciers recede, they are creating high altitude lakes. Some of them are in natural dips in the bedrock; some are accidentally dammed behind walls of glacial debris. All such lakes are susceptible to rockfalls, earthquakes and avalanches that can breach them causing dangerous flooding for mountain communities downstream.\n\nSimon Cook of Manchester Metropolitan University, the study's lead author said:\n\nWe mapped hundreds of lakes. Some lakes are very small and pose little risk. Others are very large, but there's little or no possibility that they would drain catastrophically. Others are both large enough to create a big flood, and sit beneath steep slopes or steep glaciers, and could be dangerous. It's like someone jumping into a swimming pool: It creates an over topping of the lake that can send a flood downstream.\n\nThe risk for glacial lake outburst floods has increased substantially in the past decade as climate change advances. Hundreds of potentially dangerous glacial lakes have formed in the Himalayas during the past few decades. In Bolivia, a glacier outburst flood in 2009 washed away farm animals, crops and bridges.\n\nReceding glaciers also endanger the water supply.

Each of the two infants, aged 11 and 16 months, had undergone many previous treatments, and all of them had failed. One of the infants, Layla Richards, attracted press attention in the fall when scientists at Great Ormond Street Hospital announced that Richards, who was diagnosed with cancer at just three months old, was vastly improved just a few months after beginning treatment. But at the time, scientists were hesitant to say that she had been cured. Now, the scientists say that Richards is in remission—and that they have cured a second baby as well, lending more evidence to the therapy's effectiveness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe treatment entailed collecting blood from donors, isolating healthy immune T-cells, and then using a genetic engineering tool known as TALENs to deactivate certain T-cell genes that would normally cause them to be rejected once transplanted into a leukemia patient. The T-cells were also engineered to attack cancer cells directly.\n\nSimilar treatments using engineered T-cells have been highly successful against blood cancers in other studies.

It is thought the chemical affects certain parts of the bee's brain where sensory information related to orientation is stored.\n\nSpeaking with The Guardian, Jim Jones, the EPA's assistant administrator for chemical safety and pollution prevention noted: \"This is a pretty big step forward in increasing our understanding of the potential for imidacloprids to impact colony health.\"\n\nNeonicotinoid pesticides are controversial products, given the scientific evidence concerning the impact on pollinating insects, such as bees and butterflies. The subject has been featured by Digital Journal several times over the past few years. The pesticides are currently banned in most parts of the European Union. Here the U.K. has opted out and permits the use of the pesticides in selected farms. The intended use here is to kill aphids; however, many biologists are concerned about the impact on bee populations.\n\nWith the European Union situation, European Food Safety Authority has commenced a review that could lead to the ending of the ban in relation to three neonicotinoid pesticides. The pesticides being considered are thiamethoxam, clothianidin and imidacloprid. These pesticides are made by companies like Bayer Crop Science.\n\nCentral to the review will be whether or not bees are affected. The plight of bees is very serious. In Europe, more than a quarter of Europe's bumblebees and one in 10 of all honeybees faces extinction.\n\nFranziska Achterberg, Greenpeace EU's food policy director, is concerned about the outcome, especially if there is a relaxation in the advice about pesticide use. Speaking with The Guardian, Achterberg noted: \"The pesticides industry has lobbied hard for these standards to be rejected. But the EU has a legal mandate to protect bees from harmful pesticides, and a solid risk assessment is the basis for that.\"\n\nThe outcome of the review is expected within the next few weeks.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "sample_ix": 132}

Ride share cars would be charged $4 to pick up or drop off passengers and all pick ups would be done at departures rather than arrivals, where cabs, shuttles and buses pick up passengers.\n\nLast week, six City Council members introduced a motion to review the plan by the Airport Commission. The Council has the power to veto decisions by city commissions, though it rarely does.\n\n\"There are a lot of concerns remaining, especially about safety,\" said Councilman Paul Koretz. \"I think we will have enough leverage that we can clean up their act.\"\n\nKoretz has long expressed concerns over ride share companies and wants to see them regulated in the same way as taxis before they're allowed at LAX. That would require more stringent background checks, including fingerprinting, and guarantees that cars are accessible for passengers with disabilities.\n\nHowever, the vote this week will not decide the fate of the airport's decision. If two-thirds of the council agrees, a hearing and discussion on the matter will go to committee and then be put to a vote later this year.\n\nIt's not clear whether there is widespread support in the city council to scrap the plan.\n\n\"I don't come to this with a major concern about the decision itself,\" said Councilman Bob Blumenfield, who signed onto the motion to review the decision. \"I like the disruptive technology, but I think there are important issues that need to be addressed and we need to review them.\"\n\nUber and Lyft are continuing with the application process for permits from LAX.

Tracking the Energy Revolution — Canada 2015 outlines record setting progress, clean energy champions, milestones, flagship projects.\n\nIt also offers a hint of what Canada's next federal government can do to set the tone.\n\nHere are the top three takeaways:\n\n1. Investment and jobs are both on the rise\n\nInvestment in clean energy climbed 88 percent in 2014 to nearly $11 billion. That's almost double the investment in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors combined. Also, employment in clean energy industry grew 14 percent—the fastest such rate of job growth in the country.\n\n2. The secret ingredient is policy\n\nLast year Ontario attracted nearly half of the nation's clean energy investment, and it wasn't by accident. The province's Green Energy Act last year spurred Canada's biggest wind power deal ever (CAD$2.8 billion), and the highest solar tally, too (CAD$1.6 billion).\n\n3. Ottawa can take Canada's clean energy industry to the next level\n\nThe news on clean energy is good, but with federal leadership, it could be terrific. Unlike Washington DC, Ottawa's pretty much been ignoring this sector. We hope and expect this report will serve as a flashing neon sign for federal parties: There's a huge opportunity here; get on board and show us what you can do\n\nOne thing is clear: Clean energy is the climate change solution, and a huge economic opportunity for a nation that seems fixated on getting oil and gas to market.
