NBC has taken yet another step away from ad-saturated air time with its announcement today that it will broadcast Saturday Night Live next season with 30 percent fewer commercials.\n\nFor viewers, this should be a welcome change; it means two entire commercial pods being cut out. In their place, viewers can expect to see more program content, albeit some sponsored by advertisers. SNL is no stranger to branded sketches, though, so at least it doesn't sound like the audience will be blindsided by an unfamiliar form of advertising.\n\nThe late-night show's linear ratings have been on the decline in recent years, as Deadline points out, even as skits continue to be popular online. Cutting down on commercial break time is one way the network hopes to bring viewers' eyes back to live broadcasts. The show is called Saturday Night Live, after all.\n\n\"As the decades have gone by, commercial time has grown,\" said Lorne Michaels, SNL creator and executive producer, in a statement. \"This will give time back to the show and make it easier to watch the show live.\"\n\nNBC has been looking to experiment with advertising lately. The SNL switch-up comes just days after the network revealed that June's two-hour Aquarius season 2 premiere would be broadcast commercial-free. The NBCUniversal subsidiary isn't alone, either. Multiple major media and entertainment companies have been forced to readjust their ad strategies as audiences look to ad-free options like Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, and others.\n\nIt's hard not to get excited as a viewer, but you can bet that network execs are feeling some pressure.

Adequate teacher training is of particular importance when bringing new tech into the classroom, and the concern over Trump's proposed budget cuts is that they will particularly hurt low-income rural or urban districts.\n\nFederal spending in school districts is usually a small percentage in comparison with state and local funding, which tends to be generated from the property tax revenue generated per district. It is possible that even in the face of burdensome federal cuts, districts with more robust tax revenue would continue to invest in tech innovation, but impoverished school districts may find it necessary to do without, thus widening the digital divide.\n\nIn a previous Education Dive feature about what to expect in K-12 ed tech in 2017, Robert Craven, the senior director for technology at Tustin Unified School District, predicted an increase in investment from districts and states to improve students' network connectivity off the school grounds in order to combat digital inequity.

The finding highlights the need for earlier hospice admission or other strategies to address increasing symptoms and disability at the end of life, the researchers said.\n\nThe study was published on September 12 in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.\n\nThe researchers examined information from a study of 562 people, aged 70 and older, who were not disabled when the study began but died over the following 16 years. Of these individuals, 244 (43.4 percent) were admitted to hospice during the last year of life. They were slightly older and more likely to have cognitive impairments (problems thinking and making decisions) than older adults who weren't admitted to hospice.\n\nThe researchers found that cancer and advanced dementia were the conditions that most often resulted in hospice admission. Older adults who were frail were least likely to be admitted to hospice. The most common condition leading to death was frailty, followed by organ failure, advanced dementia, and cancer.\n\nThe study also found that the duration of hospice care was less than 13 days for half of the study participants. This short duration suggests that healthcare providers might need to consider discussing referrals to hospice sooner with people who are approaching the end of their lives. Alternatively, providers may need to develop and test other ways to reduce the high burden of distressing symptoms and disability at the end of life, said the researchers.\n\n\"Failing or delaying to refer older persons to hospice at the end of life can place a high burden on caregivers and result in patient suffering,\" said Dr. Thomas Gill, the Humana Foundation Professor of Medicine and the study's first author.\n\nReferral to hospice at the end of life should be based on an older adult's burden of pain and other distressing symptoms, suggest the researchers.

The impact SaaS will have with respect to lowering the barriers to best-in-class technology, increasing accessibility to the world's financial markets, and driving down the cost of trading technology ownership for all participants, means that firms who wish to remain competitive in today's trading environment will be hard-pressed to stick with legacy, classically deployed technology. And with increased levels of accessibility, we expect to see the professional trading community expand, which is good for everyone.\n\nWhat changes does 2017 have in store for financial technology?\n\nI think we'll see firms in the industry really prioritize unlocking the potential of data. Although we all know market data is important, by combining that market data with your own trade data and by leveraging the right tools to manage these large data sets, you have the ability to unlock insights that have historically been unobtainable. It's not that this type of data hasn't always been stored; to the contrary, compliance laws have required us all to store this data for years on end.

It's become very popular with the younger generation, who seem to enjoy endless hours of puking rainbows and making themselves into slices of toast.\n\nIn 2016, media giant NBC decided to capitalize on this popularity by producing original content for some of its hit programs just for Snapchat users. With the vertical video layout of Snapchat, NBC didn't want to simply resuse video clips from programs. Instead, NBC decided to produce new content.\n\nPopular singing competition The Voice was one of the first featured on Snapchat. The series includes clips from the show's judges, as well as user-generated singing auditions. Prospective contestants can submit clips showcasing their talents at voicesnaps.com, where they will be reviewed by the show's judges, who will pick some of the hopefuls to perform in the upcoming season.\n\nBut in addition to adding new content for existing shows, NBC has also decided to launch programming that is entirely exclusive to Snapchat, like its show Stay Tuned. First debuted in July, the twice-daily headline news show features around four to five news stories focusing on the day's most important events. And thus far, it looks to be doing very, very well. According to NBCU, over 40 percent of Stay Tuned's viewers are watching at least three times a week, and the show already boasts 29 million unique viewers. As TechCrunch points out, that's about three times the number of viewers who watch NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt.\n\nAround 60 percent of the show's viewers are under the age of 25, which makes sense given Snapchat's generally youthful user base. And while it's still too soon to tell whether or not Stay Tuned is a sustainable success, early signs are quite positive.\n\nAll of this means Snapchat users are getting premiere access to mobile content from their favorite NBC programs, and some new ones, too. It also allows the network to reach millions of fans instantly right in the palm of their hand on an app they're already using. It's also a win for NBC's advertisers who are associated with this premium content and get to reach users in a new and dynamic way.

The announcement was well-placed: a drone thermal mapping solution could dramatically increase the efficiency – and lower the cost – of the solar panel installation and inspection. In fact, the potential savings for thermal image processing by drone in construction and inspection could be a game changer for the drone industry in those verticals.\n\nUsing DroneDeploy thermal image processing, solar panel installers could be able to make the required measurements on residential rooftops in half the time the process currently takes – and a commercial installation which may take days using current methods could take only minutes using a drone. It's another example of drones making the process not only faster, but better: DroneDeploy's thermal image processing can help place solar equipment more precisely for maximum production.\n\nDJI announced a partnership with Flir last December to bring thermal cameras to the air. The resulting collaboration – the Zenmuse XT thermal camera – is now available for the DJI Inspire, making the thermal image technology wid\n\nely obtainable to drone operators. The Zenmuse XT combines DJI's Zenmuse stabilized micro-gimbal technology with FLIR's Tau 2 thermal imaging camera core. The thermal imaging allows operators to see in darkness, measure temperature remotely – even tiny temperature variations – and to see through things like dust, smoke, or fog.\n\nDroneDeploy has worked closely with DJI to take the technology a step further, making thermal mapping and data processing easily accessible to commercial drone operators. While solar panel installation and other construction applications are an obvious use for thermal mapping technology, there are many; the thermal image processing can help to monitor electrical infrastructure for safety, or livestock for health, for example.\n\nDroneDeploy's new thermal image processing solution is currently in beta test – to get more information, email info@dronedeploy.com.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "sample_ix": 16, "model": "refs", "response": "Drone manufacturer DJI and DroneDeploy, the leading commercial drone cloud software platform, have announced a thermal-mapping solution that could reduce the cost and time involved in solar panel installation and inspection.

But for that to happen, the vehicles will need new and more powerful sensors. Today's autonomous cars are ill prepared for high-speed driving, bad weather and other common situations.\n\nThe recent improvements in self-driving cars coincided with the improvements offered by new lidar sensors from a Silicon Valley company called Velodyne. These sensors gave cars a way of measuring distances to nearby vehicles, pedestrians and other objects. They also provided Google and other companies with a way of mapping urban roadways in three dimensions, so that cars will know exactly where they are at any given moment — something GPS cannot always provide.\n\nBut these lidar sensors have additional shortcomings. They can gather information only about objects that are relatively close to them, which limits how fast the cars can travel. Their measurements aren't always detailed enough to distinguish one object from another. And when multiple driverless cars are close together, their signals can become garbled.\n\nOther devices can pick up some of slack. Cameras are a better way of identifying pedestrians and street signs, for example, and radar works over longer distances. That's why today's self-driving cars track their surroundings through so many different sensors.

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "While Elon Musk was entertaining a crowd of avid Tesla supporters at the company's store in Paris, he asked what improvements to the Model S they would like to see. Several guests said they would like the car to have more range. \"How much range do you want?\", Musk asked.\n\nThe answers he got were mainly within the 800 to 850 kilometer ball park, which translates to about 500 miles. Elon appeared taken aback. He explained that a battery with that much range would be extremely heavy, expensive, and impractical for normal driving due to its weight.\n\nThe most challenging aspect of selecting a battery that meets the needs of everyday consumers is finding the perfect balance between range, weight, and cost. Musk told his audience that modest improvements in battery range will take place over the next year, and result in batteries that deliver 500 kilometers of range or 300 miles. Musk has stated in the past that battery capacity would increase by approximately 5% a year for the foreseeable future, if not slightly more as Tesla's Gigafactory begins driving down cost of battery production via economies of scale.\n\nWhat followed was an idea that Elon tossed out, something he hasn't mentioned before, although others have. \"What if you had a trailer with a booster battery that you could use for long distance driving?\" he asked. Then he told the audience that he was running on about 1 hour of sleep in the past 48 hours and might not be thinking clearly. But the notion of a tag-along trailer with an auxiliary battery makes a lot of sense for those times when people are driving long distances and really do need more range.\n\nTesla's battery swapping station at Harris Ranch, CA has been the site for its pilot battery swap program, but that would be a lot more complex than hooking up a trailer and then dropping it off when it was no longer needed.

Sources close to Volvo have previously hinted the V40 Polestar could benefit from a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that will use both a turbocharger and a supercharger to generate over 300 horsepower. An automatic transmission will send power to all four wheels via a Haldex-type all-wheel drive system, the same setup found in the Golf R.\n\nInterestingly, Volvo has confirmed that it has given Polestar immediate access to its gas-electric plug-in hybrid technology. Polestar will tweak both the gasoline-burning engine and the electric motor to squeeze as much power out of the drivetrain as possible while still keeping gas mileage in check.\n\nThe Gothenburg-based automaker has made it clear that it isn't interested in following Mercedes-AMG's lead and chasing all-out volume, but it wants to gradually expand the scope of its newly acquired Polestar sub-brand.\n\n\"Driving a Volvo Polestar is a special experience.

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "Announces collaboration with US car-sharing company\n\nToyota has announced it will create a Mobility Services Platform (MSPF), which will collaborate with various service providers and telematics insurance. The MSPF will have \"various functions to support mobility services\" and \"leverage the Toyota Smart Center (TSC), the Toyota Big Data Center, and financial services\", according to a Toyota statement. The automaker will aggregate individual business functions it has created and offered to mobility service providers, including vehicle management systems and leasing programs. Toyota also announced that it has developed a Smart Key Box (SKB) for car-sharing users to lock and unlock doors or start the engine with their smartphone. The SKB is a physical unit to be placed in a car. The smartphone application receives codes from the SKB, which are authenticated with the device through Bluetooth low-energy communications for access to the vehicle. Toyota said that parameters for when the user can access the SKB are set and managed by TSC. Toyota's Mirai Creation Investment Limited Partnership has made a strategic investment (amount undisclosed) in car-sharing company Getaround. Toyota and Getaround will launch a pilot programme in January 2017 in San Francisco, California, United States. This will include a new financial product from Toyota Financial Services in which a lessee can use income from car-sharing to help generate his monthly lease payment. \"Based on the exploration results, Toyota will consider using the MSPF for other mobility services in Japan, like unmanned rent-a-car businesses,\" said the automaker.\n\nSignificance: Toyota seems to be playing a bit of catch-up in this mobility space, though it has invested in Uber. GM and Ford are among the companies that have already created mobility divisions and Audi recently announced a car-sharing trial. Ford's Peer-2-Peer experiment, announced in June 2015, leveraged Ford Credit for a similar program relative to offsetting lease payments with car-sharing income. In the United States, Ford's project used Getaround software. While many existing automakers offer smartphone apps that enable the car to be turned off or on or locked or unlocked from a phone, those apps are designed for owners and would be unable to react if a vehicle were kept too long or to other potential issues.

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "What do you do with an old salt mine? Turn it into a huge battery of course. We're all familiar with lithium-ion batteries like those in our phones, but on a utility scale, they are simply impractical. German company Ewe Gasspeicher GmbH has announced plans to build what could be called the world's biggest battery. The system, dubbed \"brine4power\" will be housed in huge underground salt caverns that were previously used as a natural gas storage facility. They each have a volume of 3.5 million cubic feet and will give the battery a capacity of up to 700MWh at an output of 120MW.\n\nIf you want energy storage on the scale of an electrical grid, there are currently two main options. The first and most common is pumped storage. It works like a standard hydroelectric power plant but in reverse. Pumps move vast amounts of water uphill to a holding pond thus storing energy in the form of gravitational potential energy. When you want to \"discharge\" the battery, you simply let the water run downhill and run the hydroelectric plant like normal.\n\nThe other main technology, and the one planned for the German project, is called a redox flow battery. It works by storing energy in the form of liquid electrolytes. There is a positive catholyte and a negative anolyte which are separated by a membrane that only allows ions to pass through.

The real-world applications for Li-Fi connectivity could revolutionize the way much of the world gets online. The R&D team bringing Li-Fi to the real world expects that solar homes, consumer gadgets, and Internet of things devices will all be able to absorb power and receive data simultaneously with a Li-Fi system in place.\n\nThe Li-Fi prototype relies on solar energy to power Internet connections so that an LED light source paired with a solar panel becomes a fully functional transmitter and receiver system for high speed, secure data transfer. Instead of relying on hardwired cables or radio waves that are easily interrupted, Li-Fi uses the nearly undetectable flicker of an LED light to transmit data.\n\nLi-Fi is much faster than most standard Wi-Fi connections, and, perhaps most importantly, provides a connection that is significantly more secure. Because Li-Fi relies on light to transmit data, you have to be in the room with your device and the Li-Fi router in order to get connected. That would preclude strangers or literal outsiders from piggy-backing on your connection or eavesdropping on your online activity.\n\nBeyond the widespread Internet access that Li-Fi could help provide around the world, the technology also has applications for reliable systems like smart city networks and Internet of Things connectivity in the smart homes of the future.\n\n\"The wider opportunity is to transform global communications by speeding up the process of bringing Internet and other data communication functionality to remote and poorer regions in a way not previously thought achievable due to lack of infrastructure and investment,\" said Tom Higgison, Edinburgh Research & Innovation's IP Project Manager.

A recent report from CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, concluded that the biggest miners are \"unprepared for the transition to a low-carbon economy\". 11 large mining companies were analysed and 9 opposed new climate regulations and only two stated support for \"climate regulation.\" Perhaps this is due to the fact that for many mining companies, the main threat lies in new charges on coal.\n\nFollowing this, THEnergy has realised that many of the large mining companies have started to focus on short-term actions regarding powering their mines: they have been preparing actions plans to react to carbon-reduction measures that might be adopted at the Paris climate conference. Large mining companies are also working on a strategy for renewable-energy projects such as wind and solar power at their mines. Companies like Rio Tinto, Glencore, BHP Billiton and Goldfields have already finished their first pilot power plants or have recently announced new projects.\n\nEnergy typically amounts to approximately 20–30% of the operating costs of a mine as such strict carbon-reduction decisions at the Paris climate conference could have a strong influence on the cost position of mines. As renewable energy can be less expensive than electricity from conventional energy sources, THEnergy stated, mining companies that manage to adapt early to the challenges of a low-carbon economy could gain significant competitive advantages.\n\n\"Mining companies are in the process of understanding that renewable energy can largely improve their competitive situation. Many miners struggle, however, to make the necessary decisions quickly as they face severe market challenges from falling commodity prices at the same time,\" explained Dr. Thomas Hillig, CEO of the consulting firm THEnergy, which specialises in the topic of renewables and mining. \"We are in a normal learning process, many mining companies have already understood that the prices of solar and wind power have decreased considerably in the last years.

THEnergy states that mining companies that transition to low-carbon sources of energy, could gain a significant competitive advantage over their competitors.

Based on current trends, the researchers estimated that the glaciers could shrink by more than 90 percent by 2100.\n\nThe researchers also found that as the glaciers recede, they are creating high altitude lakes. Some of them are in natural dips in the bedrock; some are accidentally dammed behind walls of glacial debris. All such lakes are susceptible to rockfalls, earthquakes and avalanches that can breach them causing dangerous flooding for mountain communities downstream.\n\nSimon Cook of Manchester Metropolitan University, the study's lead author said:\n\nWe mapped hundreds of lakes. Some lakes are very small and pose little risk. Others are very large, but there's little or no possibility that they would drain catastrophically. Others are both large enough to create a big flood, and sit beneath steep slopes or steep glaciers, and could be dangerous. It's like someone jumping into a swimming pool: It creates an over topping of the lake that can send a flood downstream.\n\nThe risk for glacial lake outburst floods has increased substantially in the past decade as climate change advances.

Now, the scientists say that Richards is in remission—and that they have cured a second baby as well, lending more evidence to the therapy's effectiveness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe treatment entailed collecting blood from donors, isolating healthy immune T-cells, and then using a genetic engineering tool known as TALENs to deactivate certain T-cell genes that would normally cause them to be rejected once transplanted into a leukemia patient. The T-cells were also engineered to attack cancer cells directly.\n\nSimilar treatments using engineered T-cells have been highly successful against blood cancers in other studies. But those studies rely on a patients own blood cells being altered. Using donated cells offers the potential for a cheaper, faster cure.\n\nG/O Media may get a commission 10% off 10% off Wish A gift for literally everybody.\n\nGifts under $20, $10, and even $5.

Personal data from thousands of employees was reportedly compromised along with private emails from celebrities and executives.\n\nThe suits were combined into a single class action case. A settlement was reached on Monday. It is now awaiting court approval.\n\nThe agreement was \"mutually agreed upon with the plaintiffs and is an important, positive step forward in putting the cyber-attack firmly behind us,\" Michael Lynton, the studio's CEO, said in a memo to staff on Tuesday.\n\nRelated: Sony: Hack so bad, our computers still don't work\n\nLynton said the proposal extends existing credit and fraud monitoring for employees for two more years.\n\nThe studio \"has emerged from the cyber-attack a stronger company with a smart and strategic vision for the road ahead,\" he wrote. \"We are looking forward, not back, and we are confident and optimistic about our future.\"\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "sample_ix": 147, "model": "refs", "response": "The hack-attack against Sony Pictures was a turning point in public awareness highlighting what serious cyber-attacks can achieve.

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "As Ad Week kicks off in New York today, the social media site has introduced total rating point (TRP) buying which allows advertisers to use the metric to plan, buy and measure Facebook video ads alongside TV.\n\nIn a blog post Facebook said: \"Marketers can plan a campaign across TV and Facebook with a total TRP target in mind, and they can buy a share of those TRPs directly with Facebook.\n\n\"Then, Nielsen's Digital Ad Ratings measurement system can verify Facebook's in-target TRP delivery, and Nielsen's Total Ad Ratings system can verify the TRP delivery for Facebook and television combined.\"\n\nFacebook is also introducing a new way of optimising campaigns with a tool that will observe the type of people who pay attention to a particular ad.\n\nFor example, if a campaign is targeted towards women aged between 35 and 54, the tool will pick up on people who pay attention to it. The ad is then targeted to people similar to those who have noticed it.\n\nWith an increasing number of people using mobiles, Facebook has teamed up with Millward Brown Digital so that advertisers can analyse the impact of their ads.\n\nEarlier this year, the site partnered with Nielsen so today's announcement means that brands can use either measurement for mobile polling.\n\nThis week will see Facebook introducing videos to its carousel platform too. It was launched last year to allow advertisers to add more images in one post which Facebook explained as an \"amazing storytelling tool for brand marketers\".\n\nWith the addition of videos to the platform, Facebook said it will help brands tell a more \"compelling\" story within a news feed.\n\nIn an interview with Campaign, Graham Mudd, the director of ad product marketing at Facebook, said: \"The shift in consumer behaviour to mobile devices will change marketing.\n\n\"These products will help in this mobile-first world and take advantage of the capabilities of mobile devices.\n\n\"For us, that's the primary focus – to help advertisers take advantage. We compare this with the shift from radio to TV.\n\n\"It was important to understand the difference in the medium and how to take advantage, so the same learning is needed in mobile.\"\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "sample_ix": 148, "model": "refs", "response": "As Facebook announce that they now have 2.5 million active advertisers on their platform, a 25% increase from February, Facebook has released four updates to its ad formats.

Facebook has also teamed up with Millward Brown Digital so Facebook can better analyse the impact of their ads by using a tool that will observe the type of people who pay attention to the ads.
