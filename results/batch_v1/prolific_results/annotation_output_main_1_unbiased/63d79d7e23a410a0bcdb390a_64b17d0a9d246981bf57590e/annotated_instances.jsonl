However, the drinkable water it is making, is only used at the power plant.\"It is our drinking water, it is the water we use in the kitchen, we operate it in the plant, it is all the water we use on site,\" says Tom Jones, who oversees the desal facility at the power plant. \"The water started in the Pacific, went through our water treatment plant -- it is a water desalination facility.The harsh drought leaving a dry mark on the state, officials say this water can be used for much more than the plant's uses.In the state of California, this is the largest operating desalination plant that can produce up to one million gallons of water a day, butHill does not want that extra water to go waste. He says his plan is to buy the extra 60 percent from PG&E.With the depleting reservoirs, time is of the essence.\"It would be a couple months to a year or two,\" says Jones. \"We would have to construct a pipeline from Diablo Canyon to the front gate which is about seven and a half miles,County officials say the first priority areas are the South County basins. Next would be the Los Osos area. Eventually, the county's goal is to expand the desal plant to be able to sell the water to neighboring counties.It is not clear how much that water would cost residents or how much the county would spend on the project.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Google is to change the way it scans emails after settling a case in a northern California district court. Emails will now be scanned once they are in the recipient's Gmail inbox rather than during the delivery process. The previous method meant that non-Gmail accounts were being catalogued as well, which led the plaintiffs in Matera vs. Google to argue that this violated privacy laws.

The company can produce nearly a million gallons of water a day but this has only been available for internal use so far.
