The plant, which was built in 1990 and has been operating for 30 years, produces drinkable water for use in the power plant and is the only new water source in the county. The county has plans to buy the water on a long-term basis, with the first priority being to supply water to the South County basins and the Los Osos area. The county estimates that the project will cost between $10m and $20m, and that it will take between six months and a year to get the water to the front gate of the plant.", "Response B": "The Diablo Canyon Power Plant has been operating a desalination plant for the past 30 years, which produces up to one million gallons of water a day. County officials want to purchase the extra 60% of the water that is not used at the plant, to help provide much-needed water to parched areas of the county. It is not clear how much the water would cost residents or how much the county would spend on the project, but county officials estimate it would take about a year or two to construct a pipeline from the power plant to the county, and a couple of months to begin delivering water.
