Deutsche Securities Korea could not be reached for comment.\n\nPrior to the ruling, Korean prosecutors indicted three foreign employees at Deutsche Bank's Hong Kong branch on charges of their involvement in the so-called Nov. 11 Option Shock case. The German companies and affected financial companies have accepted the court ruling without any legal disputes, the reports said.\n\nThere are more financial firms who have reportedly filed a suit against the two Deutsche units on the same charges.\n\nCompanies including Hana Financial Investment and Hyundai Wise Asset Management also took the matter to court to claim damages worth a total 89.8 billion won.
