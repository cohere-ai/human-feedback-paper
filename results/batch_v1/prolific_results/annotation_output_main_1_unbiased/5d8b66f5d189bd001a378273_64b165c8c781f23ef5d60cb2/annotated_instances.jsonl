The asset to debt ratio is typically expressed as a percentage, and it is used to determine the extent to which an entity\u2019s total assets are being used to pay off debts.\n\nThe asset to debt ratio is calculated by dividing the total value of an entity\u2019s assets by the total value of its debts. The resulting ratio can be used to determine the extent to which an entity\u2019s total assets are being used to pay off debts.\n\nFor example, if an entity has $10,000,000 in total assets and $5,000,000 in total debts, its asset to debt ratio would be 20%. This means that 20% of the entity\u2019s total assets are being used to pay off its debts.\n\nThe asset to debt ratio is a useful measure of an entity\u2019s financial health, as it can indicate the extent to which its total assets are being used to pay off its debts. It is often used by investors and lenders to evaluate the risk and potential of an entity, and it can also be used to compare the financial health of different entities.\n\nI hope this helps you calculate the asset to debt ratio. If you have any other questions, please let me know."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 14}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d8b66f5d189bd001a378273_64b165c8c781f23ef5d60cb2", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "5", "feedback": "Response B is more user friendly"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 36s "}}
