{"id": "740", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to give a horse an injection?", "Response A": "Ask an experienced horse person to help out.If you're reading this article, you likely don't have a lot of experience with giving injections.\nHave a professional inject a needle-shy horse.\nAsk your vet about safety precautions.To be safe, you should know whether the medication would be dangerous to you if you accidentally injected some into yourself.\nUse a brand new needle for each injection.\nUnderstand how to give an intramuscular (IM) injection.This is the most common injection method, during which the needle passes through the skin into the muscle underneath.\nDecide where on the horse to give the injection.\nPut yourself a safe position.\nCalm the horse.\nUnderstand why many people prefer giving injections in the neck.\nFamiliarize yourself with the anatomy of the injection site.\nPinpoint the ideal injection spot.\nKnow the advantages and disadvantages of a hindquarters injection.\nGet to know the anatomy of the hindquarters.\nLocate the ideal injection site.\nAvoid injecting into the top of the rump.The top of the rump/buttocks used to be a popular injection site because you can stand further forward, out of reach of kicking legs.\nDo not \"tap\" the horse at the injection site.\nDisconnect the needle from the syringe.\nInsert the needle at a 90\u00b0 angle.\nDraw back on the needle before every injection.\nConnect the syringe to the needle.\nAddress any bleeding.\nDispose of the needle and syringes responsibly.", "Response B": "Sure, here are the steps:\n\n1) Make sure the horse is calm and relaxed.  If the horse is nervous or upset, it will be more difficult to give the injection.\n\n2) Choose an injection site.  The most common sites are the neck, shoulder, or hip.  Avoid injecting near the tail, as this can cause the horse to kick.\n\n3) Clean the injection site with an alcohol wipe.\n\n4) Insert the needle into the horse at a 90 degree angle.  Try to go in with one motion, and don't push too hard or you might hit a bone.\n\n5) Inject the medication.  Try to do this slowly, so the horse doesn't feel a sudden rush of medicine.\n\n6) Once the injection is complete, withdraw the needle and cover the injection site with a bandage.\n\n7) Monitor the horse for any signs of distress or discomfort.  If the horse seems to be in pain or has a fever, contact your vet immediately."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 16}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5bb0df0871e1b2000176bfc2_64b16ccbafbd30170bc9b94e", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 7s "}}
