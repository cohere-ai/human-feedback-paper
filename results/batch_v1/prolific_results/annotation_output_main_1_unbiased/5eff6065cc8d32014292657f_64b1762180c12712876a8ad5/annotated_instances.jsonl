{"id": "479", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to give a horse an injection?", "Response A": "Sure, here are the steps you should follow:\n\n1.  Go to the horse\u2019s stable and get a clean needle and a vial of the horse\u2019s medication.\n\n2.  Open the vial and pour the medication into the needle.\n\n3.  Insert the needle into the horse\u2019s skin.\n\n4.  Draw up the medication into the needle.\n\n5.  Dispose of the needle and vial in a safe location.", "Response B": "Sure, here are the steps:\n\n1) Make sure the horse is calm and relaxed.  If the horse is nervous or upset, it will be more difficult to give the injection.\n\n2) Choose an injection site.  The most common sites are the neck, shoulder, or hip.  Avoid injecting near the tail, as this can cause the horse to kick.\n\n3) Clean the injection site with an alcohol wipe.\n\n4) Insert the needle into the horse at a 90 degree angle.  Try to go in with one motion, and don't push too hard or you might hit a bone.\n\n5) Inject the medication.  Try to do this slowly, so the horse doesn't feel a sudden rush of medicine.\n\n6) Once the injection is complete, withdraw the needle and cover the injection site with a bandage.\n\n7) Monitor the horse for any signs of distress or discomfort.  If the horse seems to be in pain or has a fever, contact your vet immediately."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 16}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5eff6065cc8d32014292657f_64b1762180c12712876a8ad5", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 37s "}}
