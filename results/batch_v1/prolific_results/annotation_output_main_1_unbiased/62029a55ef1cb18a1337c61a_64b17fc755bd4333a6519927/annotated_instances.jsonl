The asset to debt ratio is a financial metric used to measure the relationship between a company's assets and its debts.  To calculate the ratio, you first need to determine the company's total assets and total debts.  Then, you divide the company's total assets by its total debts to get the asset to debt ratio.  A higher asset to debt ratio indicates that a company has a healthier financial position, since it has more assets to use to pay off its debts.", "Response B": "Locate a source of recent financial information for the company.\nFind the total assets of the company.\nDetermine the total debt of the company.\nSet up your equation.\nDivide total liabilities by total assets.\nConvert your result to a percentage.\nConsider subtracting intangible assets.\nCalculate the debt to equity ratio.\nUnderstand what the ratio tells you.\nAnalyze the company's solvency.\nAnalyze the asset to debt ratio of potential investments.\nKnow the weaknesses of the asset to debt ratio."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 14}, "label_annotations": {"email": "62029a55ef1cb18a1337c61a_64b17fc755bd4333a6519927", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 33s "}}
