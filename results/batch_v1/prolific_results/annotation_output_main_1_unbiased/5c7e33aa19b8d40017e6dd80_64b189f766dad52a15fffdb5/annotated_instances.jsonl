The 2016 Horizon Report, produced by the New Media Consortium and the Consortium for School Networking, named virtual reality among the tech developments that could foster real changes in education in the next two to three years. Google is adding new Expeditions to its catalog of virtual field trips all the time and government organizations like the Smithsonian are adding their own.\n\nKey to incorporating virtual reality into classrooms is having a clear pedagogical framework. It is easy to incorporate virtual reality as an add-on to existing lessons that excites students. What's harder is embedding the virtual reality experience into the learning itself. Schools that want teachers to use VR might consider offering targeted professional learning opportunities to ensure they are doing so in the right ways.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Encrypted cloud storage and file sharing firm Sync.com, a 'Dropbox alternative' that has over 100,000 individual and business users globally, has begun accepting Bitcoin as a payment method.
