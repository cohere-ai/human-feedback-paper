You\u2019ll need some chemicals called \u201cblack powder\u201d, \u201cred iron oxide\u201d, \u201ccharcoal\u201d, and \u201csulfur\u201d, and you\u2019ll need to mix them together in a certain way.  After that you\u2019ll need to put them in a rocket or other device, and then light the fuse.  You\u2019ll need to be careful not to get too close to the fireworks, and to make sure you\u2019re not lighting them in a place where they could cause damage."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 15}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d3fa0d6c990bc96e11becf_64b16f5473414a81806a4d5d", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "4", "feedback": "I like response \"B\", because people might get hurt if they try out response \"A\"."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 21s "}}
