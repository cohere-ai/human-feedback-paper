{"id": "590", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to deal with an ex boyfriend who wants more space?", "Response A": "It's important to respect your ex boyfriend's wishes and give him the space he needs. Try to focus on your own happiness and well-being during this time. You may want to consider seeking support from friends and family members, or pursuing new hobbies or interests to keep yourself busy. It's also important to take time to reflect and process your feelings before jumping into a new relationship.", "Response B": "Sure, I can explain a bit about what \u201cspace\u201d means in a relationship, and how you might be able to work with that.  Space is a common request in relationships, and it basically means that the person wants some time and emotional space from you.  It can be difficult to hear that someone wants space from you, especially if you\u2019ve been very close, but it can be very healthy to give each other space from time to time.  Space can help you both to focus on yourself, and also to miss each other, which can help strengthen the relationship.  One way to do that is to try to respect your ex\u2019s desire for space, and not contact him or try to force a connection.  You could also try to take some time for yourself to focus on your own interests and hobbies, so that you\u2019re not constantly thinking about him.  Hope that helps!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 22}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63c58429db2b7daf0f67d60d_64b1727bf5e515610388eda6", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "5", "feedback": "Response B is best as this is about matters of the heart."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 53s "}}
