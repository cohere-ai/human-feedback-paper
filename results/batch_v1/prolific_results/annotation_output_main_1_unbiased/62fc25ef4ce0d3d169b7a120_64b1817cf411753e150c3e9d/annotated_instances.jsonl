First of all, you want to buy clothes that fit you well.  Then, you want to buy clothes that are comfortable, and also look good on you.  You also want to buy clothes that are high quality, so they last a long time.  Finally, you want to buy clothes that are reasonably priced, so you don\u2019t spend too much money.
