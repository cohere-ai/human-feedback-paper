Secondhand stress is the stress you\u2019re exposed to from other people.  The best way to avoid it is to avoid those people or situations.  You can also try to reduce your own stress by doing things that are relaxing for you.  These include exercise, meditation, and spending time with friends or family.  You can also try to reduce your stress by focusing on your own goals and achievements, rather than on what other people are doing.  Finally, you can try to reduce your stress by getting enough sleep and eating a healthy diet.", "Response B": "Stress can be difficult to identify, but there are some common symptoms to look out for. Some people experience physical symptoms like muscle tension, headaches, or stomach problems. Others experience emotional symptoms like anxiety, anger, or depression. And some people experience both types of symptoms. If you notice yourself experiencing any of these symptoms on a regular basis, it may be a sign that you are under stress. To avoid secondhand stress, it can help to be mindful of your own stress levels, and try to manage them effectively. You can also try to reduce your exposure to stressful situations."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 23}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to spot and avoid secondhand stress?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Yes, I can!
