Mix 1 tablespoon of baking soda with a small amount of water until it forms a paste. Apply the paste to the stain and let it sit for about 30 minutes. Then, scrub the stain with a soft cloth and rinse the pot with water. You can also try using vinegar or lemon juice to remove stains.", "Response B": "Sure, here are some general tips on removing coffee stains from stainless steel: \n\n-Use warm water with a mild detergent.\n\n-If the stain is stubborn, try a non-scratching stainless steel cleaner, or a baking soda/water paste.\n\n-Avoid abrasive cleaners, as these can scratch the surface of the steel."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 19}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to remove coffee stains from a stainless steel pot?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            You can try using baking soda and water to remove coffee stains from a stainless steel pot.
