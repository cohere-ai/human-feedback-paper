{"id": "925", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make fireworks?", "Response A": "Sure!  In order to make fireworks, you will need some combustible materials, such as black powder or other types of explosive chemicals.  You will also need some sort of container to hold the materials, as well as some sort of fuse or igniter to set off the explosion.  Once you have gathered these materials, you can create your own fireworks by mixing the chemicals, placing them in the container, and then igniting the fuse.  Different types of fireworks produce various colors and effects, so you can experiment with different chemical combinations to create your desired effects.  Safety precautions are very important when handling explosive materials, so be sure to follow any applicable laws and safety guidelines when creating your fireworks.", "Response B": "Sure, fireworks are a kind of pyrotechnic device, and you can make them by mixing together certain chemicals and putting them in a rocket or other device.  You\u2019ll need some chemicals called \u201cblack powder\u201d, \u201cred iron oxide\u201d, \u201ccharcoal\u201d, and \u201csulfur\u201d, and you\u2019ll need to mix them together in a certain way.  After that you\u2019ll need to put them in a rocket or other device, and then light the fuse.  You\u2019ll need to be careful not to get too close to the fireworks, and to make sure you\u2019re not lighting them in a place where they could cause damage."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 15}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63101cafd1872c9ac5d04944_64b1659a492db61525c42385", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "2", "score_b": "4", "feedback": "I think if people try to follow response a, they are laible to blow their hands off.
