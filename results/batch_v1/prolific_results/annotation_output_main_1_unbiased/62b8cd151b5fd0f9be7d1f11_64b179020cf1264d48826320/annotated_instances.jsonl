{"id": "387", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Coworking is love\n\nI love the coworking movement. As a perpetually on-the-go freelancer, it's hard to find a decent spot full of like-minded people working in tandem: coffee shops end up being too chatty, I can't count on a library being within walking distance of my lodging, and the whole \"I need a power outlet\" thing puts a bit of a kibosh on working outside most of the time.\n\nRead also: Croissant makes freelance the coolest place to work\n\nThinking outside the box\n\nI would, however, gladly work AT Outsite\u2013the latest in a string of coworking sites dedicated to making sure freelancers and contract workers have access to an environment conducive to productivity. Unlike your run-of-the-mill coworking space, however, this startup emphasizes both working AND playing hard.\n\nWork hard, play hard\n\nThe concept is pretty straightforward: Outsite provides you with a paid membership that gets you hefty discounts on lodging in places such as Santa Cruz, San Diego, and Lake Tahoe. Once there, you work side by side with other freelancers.\n\nAfter a hard day of work, you can relax alongside those same people, with site-specific activities including spas, BBQs, beach activities, and yoga classes, to name a few.\n\nVacation meets productivity\n\nThis is a freakin' cool idea because it takes the allure of a vacation and combines it with the romanticization of working remotely. The final product is a mind-clearing getaway wherein one can focus on work and relaxation in tandem\u2013a concept that, despite its proven health and productivity benefits, is still a minority in the workplace.\n\nAdvertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\nSay no more\n\nFrom a personal standpoint, I'd be delighted to spend a week in any of Outsite's glorious locations with a 60-hour agenda and evenings free.\n\nThis grandiose endeavor is indicative of a surge in popularity of remote work and gig economy.\n\nThese are two cultures in which I happily partake\u2013and the \"work hard, play hard\" aspect of an exotic location paired with the ability to get away from the hustle and bustle of day-to-day life should make for an interesting routine.\n\nIf you find yourself as intrigued as I am, head on over to their website at https://outsite.co and check out their services\u2013I know I'll be keeping a keen eye on this startup.\n\n#Outsite\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "An enterprising start-up is combining work and play for freelancers and business travellers looking to balance productivity and relaxation.
