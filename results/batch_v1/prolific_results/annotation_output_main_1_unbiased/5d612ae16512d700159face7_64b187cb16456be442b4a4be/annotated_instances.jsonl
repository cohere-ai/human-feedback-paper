However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to give an injection to a horse.\n\nFirst, gather the necessary supplies, such as the appropriate needle, syringe, and medication. Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab, and prepare the medication according to the instructions. Hold the horse steady, and insert the needle at a 45-degree angle into the designated injection site. Push the plunger slowly to inject the medication, and remove the needle.\n\nIt is important to note that the exact procedure may vary depending on the type of medication and the specific health condition of the horse. It is always best to consult with a veterinarian or experienced horse owner before attempting to administer injections.", "Response B": "Ask an experienced horse person to help out.If you're reading this article, you likely don't have a lot of experience with giving injections.\nHave a professional inject a needle-shy horse.\nAsk your vet about safety precautions.To be safe, you should know whether the medication would be dangerous to you if you accidentally injected some into yourself.\nUse a brand new needle for each injection.\nUnderstand how to give an intramuscular (IM) injection.This is the most common injection method, during which the needle passes through the skin into the muscle underneath.\nDecide where on the horse to give the injection.\nPut yourself a safe position.\nCalm the horse.\nUnderstand why many people prefer giving injections in the neck.\nFamiliarize yourself with the anatomy of the injection site.\nPinpoint the ideal injection spot.\nKnow the advantages and disadvantages of a hindquarters injection.\nGet to know the anatomy of the hindquarters.\nLocate the ideal injection site.\nAvoid injecting into the top of the rump.The top of the rump/buttocks used to be a popular injection site because you can stand further forward, out of reach of kicking legs.\nDo not \"tap\" the horse at the injection site.\nDisconnect the needle from the syringe.\nInsert the needle at a 90\u00b0 angle.\nDraw back on the needle before every injection.\nConnect the syringe to the needle.\nAddress any bleeding.\nDispose of the needle and syringes responsibly."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 16}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d612ae16512d700159face7_64b187cb16456be442b4a4be", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "5", "feedback": "Thank you!"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 32s "}}
