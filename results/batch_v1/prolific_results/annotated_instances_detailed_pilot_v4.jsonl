Get news about destinations opening, inspiration for future adventures, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.\n\nCNN --\n\nFor years, journey times flying east from Israel depended on who you were flying with.\n\nIf you were boarding a flight operated by Israeli airlines, including national carrier El Al, your flight would take around two hours more than if you were flying with another airline.\n\nThe reason? Israeli airlines were banned from the airspace of both Oman and Saudi Arabia. That meant flights to India and Southeast Asia, which would naturally head east from Israel, had to dip south, crossing over Jordan and following the Red Sea down to the bottom of the Arabian Peninsula, before hooking northeast.\n\nNow, all that is set to change. Following the Saudi government's announcement in July 2022 that the country's airspace would open up to all carriers, Oman has followed suit.\n\nEl Al has posted a map of their current and new routes to Southeast Asia From El Al Israel\n\nOn February 23, the Civil Aviation Authority of Oman announced that it will open its airspace to \"all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflying\" - effectively ending the ban on El Al, Israir and Arkia, Israel's three airlines.\n\nIn a tweet, it said the move was \"part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfil its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, which stipulates non-discrimination between civil aircrafts used in international air navigation.\"\n\nThe move could cut Israeli carriers' flight times to Asia by up to three hours, Jonathan Sivarajah, an El Al frequent flier and Israeli aviation commentator, told CNN.\n\nAs part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfill its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, the Civil Aviation Authority affirms that the Sultanate's airspace is open for all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflyuing. pic.twitter.com/jNaqqDxZM1 -- hyy'@ lTWyrn lmdny (@CAAOMN) February 23, 2023\n\nHe added that it \"opens up further opportunities [for the airlines], not only to Asia but potentially to Australia, too.\"\n\nEl Al's nonstop flight from Tel Aviv to Bangkok is currently listed as taking 10 hours 45 minutes. But a nonstop flight on Royal Jordanian from Amman - 100 miles east of Tel Aviv - takes eight hours 10 minutes. In fact, flying Tel Aviv to Amman, and then on to Bangkok can be quicker, even including transfer time at the airport - a connecting flight can take as little as nine hours 55 minutes on Royal Jordanian.\n\nWhen the airline was banned from Saudi airspace, El Al flights from Tel Aviv to Mumbai took seven hours 45 minutes. That flight time was then slashed to five hours 15 minutes, before the route was put on hold.\n\nAs the announcement was made, El Al swiftly posted a map of their old and new routes to Southeast Asia on Instagram.\n\nSivarajah said that until now, competing international carriers have \"flooded\" Israel with quicker flights than what the country's own airlines were able to provide.\n\n\"Tel Aviv-bound foreign carriers such as Air India could operate over territory which El Al couldn't. There was a significant fare difference because of the routing in favor of the likes of Air India,\" he said.\n\n\"It wasn't until the Abraham Accords [of 2020] and the Saudi approval that it became partly possible for Israeli carriers to compete. The last stumbling block was Oman.\"\n\nHe expects the new routings to start \"within the next few days.\"\n\nIn a statement, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it \"a day of great news for Israeli aviation.\"\n\nHe added: \"The Far East is not so far away and the skies are no longer the limit.\n\n\"We have worked to open the airspace, first over Saudi Arabia, and from 2018 when I visited Oman, to add Oman as well, so that we can fly directly to India and on to Australia. This was achieved today, after considerable effort, including in recent months. Here is good news - Israel is opening up to the east on an unprecedented scale.\"\n\nIsrael's Foreign Minister Eli Cohen also released a statement, calling the news \"a historic decision that will shorten the road to Asia, lower costs for Israeli citizens and help Israeli airlines to be more competitive.\" He personally thanked the sultan of Oman, Haitham bin Tariq al-Said, for his \"substantial help\" in the process.\n\nThe announcement came after months of talks between the two countries.\n\nIt also follows an announcement earlier this month that El Al would start a frequent flier partnership with UAE carrier Etihad Airways. Frequent fliers can now collect and spend air miles across both airlines. The two had started codesharing on flights in 2021.\n\nLast year, El Al said that a route from Tel Aviv to Melbourne, Australia, was in the works.\nSummary: Oman is opening up its airspace to Iranian carriers, including Iran Air. Previously, the airlines had to fly a roundabout route to parts of Asia, adding hours to journey times.\nIs the summary consistent with the document? First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "The summary is not consistent with the document, which discusses the opening of Oman's airspace to all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflying, not to Iranian carriers specifically.\nNo", "Response B": "Yes, the summary is consistent with the document. The document mentions that Oman has opened its airspace to Iranian carriers, including Iran Air, which was previously banned from the airspace. The summary explains how this will shorten flight times and increase competitiveness of Israeli carriers.

Get news about destinations opening, inspiration for future adventures, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.\n\nCNN --\n\nFor years, journey times flying east from Israel depended on who you were flying with.\n\nIf you were boarding a flight operated by Israeli airlines, including national carrier El Al, your flight would take around two hours more than if you were flying with another airline.\n\nThe reason? Israeli airlines were banned from the airspace of both Oman and Saudi Arabia. That meant flights to India and Southeast Asia, which would naturally head east from Israel, had to dip south, crossing over Jordan and following the Red Sea down to the bottom of the Arabian Peninsula, before hooking northeast.\n\nNow, all that is set to change. Following the Saudi government's announcement in July 2022 that the country's airspace would open up to all carriers, Oman has followed suit.\n\nEl Al has posted a map of their current and new routes to Southeast Asia From El Al Israel\n\nOn February 23, the Civil Aviation Authority of Oman announced that it will open its airspace to \"all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflying\" - effectively ending the ban on El Al, Israir and Arkia, Israel's three airlines.\n\nIn a tweet, it said the move was \"part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfil its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, which stipulates non-discrimination between civil aircrafts used in international air navigation.\"\n\nThe move could cut Israeli carriers' flight times to Asia by up to three hours, Jonathan Sivarajah, an El Al frequent flier and Israeli aviation commentator, told CNN.\n\nAs part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfill its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, the Civil Aviation Authority affirms that the Sultanate's airspace is open for all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflyuing. pic.twitter.com/jNaqqDxZM1 -- hyy'@ lTWyrn lmdny (@CAAOMN) February 23, 2023\n\nHe added that it \"opens up further opportunities [for the airlines], not only to Asia but potentially to Australia, too.\"\n\nEl Al's nonstop flight from Tel Aviv to Bangkok is currently listed as taking 10 hours 45 minutes. But a nonstop flight on Royal Jordanian from Amman - 100 miles east of Tel Aviv - takes eight hours 10 minutes. In fact, flying Tel Aviv to Amman, and then on to Bangkok can be quicker, even including transfer time at the airport - a connecting flight can take as little as nine hours 55 minutes on Royal Jordanian.\n\nWhen the airline was banned from Saudi airspace, El Al flights from Tel Aviv to Mumbai took seven hours 45 minutes.

The document mentions that Oman has opened its airspace to Iranian carriers, including Iran Air, which was previously banned from the airspace. The summary explains how this will shorten flight times and increase competitiveness of Israeli carriers. The document also mentions that frequent flier partnerships between El Al and Etihad Airways have been established, and that the two airlines have started codesharing on flights.

{"id": "10", "input_text": {"Prompt": "The Super Bowl seems to be just about the only time anyone is actually excited about commercials, and TV network execs are well aware of it. NBC has taken yet another step away from ad-saturated air time with its announcement today that it will broadcast Saturday Night Live next season with 30 percent fewer commercials.\n\nFor viewers, this should be a welcome change; it means two entire commercial pods being cut out. In their place, viewers can expect to see more program content, albeit some sponsored by advertisers. SNL is no stranger to branded sketches, though, so at least it doesn't sound like the audience will be blindsided by an unfamiliar form of advertising.\n\nThe late-night show's linear ratings have been on the decline in recent years, as Deadline points out, even as skits continue to be popular online. Cutting down on commercial break time is one way the network hopes to bring viewers' eyes back to live broadcasts. The show is called Saturday Night Live, after all.\n\n\"As the decades have gone by, commercial time has grown,\" said Lorne Michaels, SNL creator and executive producer, in a statement. \"This will give time back to the show and make it easier to watch the show live.\"\n\nNBC has been looking to experiment with advertising lately. The SNL switch-up comes just days after the network revealed that June's two-hour Aquarius season 2 premiere would be broadcast commercial-free. The NBCUniversal subsidiary isn't alone, either. Multiple major media and entertainment companies have been forced to readjust their ad strategies as audiences look to ad-free options like Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, and others.\n\nIt's hard not to get excited as a viewer, but you can bet that network execs are feeling some pressure. It's up to them to find their ideal balance between making audiences happy and bringing in revenue.\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Following decades of increasing numbers of commercials on TV, many networks are now starting to cut them back as they seek to stem the shrinking audiences and attract young viewers, who have shifted to on-demand services such as Netflix and YouTube. For instance, ads shown during Saturday Night Live are to be cut by 30% next season, and Time Warner have announced plans to cut the ad load on some programming by 50%. This follows a similar trend happening on online advertisers as well, with YouTube releasing its Red subscription service thereby allowing viewers the option for a premium ad-free experience. All this means is that advertising is heading towards a major transformation.", "Response B": "NBC will air Saturday Night Live with 30 percent fewer commercials next season.\n\nThis is exciting for viewers who are tired of sitting through commercials, but it is also a challenge for network execs who are trying to find a balance between pleasing audiences and bringing in revenue."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "pilot_batch_v4_shuffled_mpt", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 2}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d5021468a31efc02740c1e_64a591f2e6c5614d699e439f", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "4", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "3", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "no", "feedback": "none"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 9m 45s "}}

Get news about destinations opening, inspiration for future adventures, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.\n\nCNN --\n\nFor years, journey times flying east from Israel depended on who you were flying with.\n\nIf you were boarding a flight operated by Israeli airlines, including national carrier El Al, your flight would take around two hours more than if you were flying with another airline.\n\nThe reason? Israeli airlines were banned from the airspace of both Oman and Saudi Arabia. That meant flights to India and Southeast Asia, which would naturally head east from Israel, had to dip south, crossing over Jordan and following the Red Sea down to the bottom of the Arabian Peninsula, before hooking northeast.\n\nNow, all that is set to change. Following the Saudi government's announcement in July 2022 that the country's airspace would open up to all carriers, Oman has followed suit.\n\nEl Al has posted a map of their current and new routes to Southeast Asia From El Al Israel\n\nOn February 23, the Civil Aviation Authority of Oman announced that it will open its airspace to \"all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflying\" - effectively ending the ban on El Al, Israir and Arkia, Israel's three airlines.\n\nIn a tweet, it said the move was \"part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfil its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, which stipulates non-discrimination between civil aircrafts used in international air navigation.\"\n\nThe move could cut Israeli carriers' flight times to Asia by up to three hours, Jonathan Sivarajah, an El Al frequent flier and Israeli aviation commentator, told CNN.\n\nAs part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfill its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, the Civil Aviation Authority affirms that the Sultanate's airspace is open for all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflyuing. pic.twitter.com/jNaqqDxZM1 -- hyy'@ lTWyrn lmdny (@CAAOMN) February 23, 2023\n\nHe added that it \"opens up further opportunities [for the airlines], not only to Asia but potentially to Australia, too.\"\n\nEl Al's nonstop flight from Tel Aviv to Bangkok is currently listed as taking 10 hours 45 minutes. But a nonstop flight on Royal Jordanian from Amman - 100 miles east of Tel Aviv - takes eight hours 10 minutes. In fact, flying Tel Aviv to Amman, and then on to Bangkok can be quicker, even including transfer time at the airport - a connecting flight can take as little as nine hours 55 minutes on Royal Jordanian.\n\nWhen the airline was banned from Saudi airspace, El Al flights from Tel Aviv to Mumbai took seven hours 45 minutes. That flight time was then slashed to five hours 15 minutes, before the route was put on hold.\n\nAs the announcement was made, El Al swiftly posted a map of their old and new routes to Southeast Asia on Instagram.\n\nSivarajah said that until now, competing international carriers have \"flooded\" Israel with quicker flights than what the country's own airlines were able to provide.\n\n\"Tel Aviv-bound foreign carriers such as Air India could operate over territory which El Al couldn't. There was a significant fare difference because of the routing in favor of the likes of Air India,\" he said.\n\n\"It wasn't until the Abraham Accords [of 2020] and the Saudi approval that it became partly possible for Israeli carriers to compete.

First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "Yes, the summary is consistent with the document. The document mentions that Oman has opened its airspace to Iranian carriers, including Iran Air, which was previously banned from the airspace. The summary explains how this will shorten flight times and increase competitiveness of Israeli carriers. The document also mentions that frequent flier partnerships between El Al and Etihad Airways have been established, and that the two airlines have started codesharing on flights. Therefore, the summary accurately reflects the content of the document.", "Response B": "The summary is not consistent with the document, which discusses the opening of Oman's airspace to all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflying, not to Iranian carriers specifically.\nNo"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "pilot_batch_v4_shuffled_mpt", "dataset": "factualnlg", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 2}, "label_annotations": {"email": "62c4590804317dc197ecbe8a_64a5926071cd2490b9d5a294", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "2", "style_b": "2", "confidence_a": "3", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "3", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "2", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "Yes", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 26m 47s "}}

{"id": "55", "input_text": {"Prompt": "The Super Bowl seems to be just about the only time anyone is actually excited about commercials, and TV network execs are well aware of it. NBC has taken yet another step away from ad-saturated air time with its announcement today that it will broadcast Saturday Night Live next season with 30 percent fewer commercials.\n\nFor viewers, this should be a welcome change; it means two entire commercial pods being cut out. In their place, viewers can expect to see more program content, albeit some sponsored by advertisers. SNL is no stranger to branded sketches, though, so at least it doesn't sound like the audience will be blindsided by an unfamiliar form of advertising.\n\nThe late-night show's linear ratings have been on the decline in recent years, as Deadline points out, even as skits continue to be popular online. Cutting down on commercial break time is one way the network hopes to bring viewers' eyes back to live broadcasts. The show is called Saturday Night Live, after all.\n\n\"As the decades have gone by, commercial time has grown,\" said Lorne Michaels, SNL creator and executive producer, in a statement. \"This will give time back to the show and make it easier to watch the show live.\"\n\nNBC has been looking to experiment with advertising lately. The SNL switch-up comes just days after the network revealed that June's two-hour Aquarius season 2 premiere would be broadcast commercial-free. The NBCUniversal subsidiary isn't alone, either. Multiple major media and entertainment companies have been forced to readjust their ad strategies as audiences look to ad-free options like Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, and others.\n\nIt's hard not to get excited as a viewer, but you can bet that network execs are feeling some pressure. It's up to them to find their ideal balance between making audiences happy and bringing in revenue.\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "NBC has decided to cut the number of commercial breaks in Saturday Night Live by 30%, with the aim of making the show more watchable live.

However, the move will also put the network at risk, as it will have to make up for the loss of advertising revenue. NBC's average advertising revenue was $1.6bn in 2016, according to research by the New York Times.

{"id": "2", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to find a hidden unicode maker on your computer?", "Response A": "Sure, I can help with that!  First you need to open a terminal window, which you can do by going to Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal.  In the terminal window, type the following command:\nmkroman\n\nThis will create a new file called \u2018mkroman\u2019 in the directory that you are currently in.  Next, open the \u2018mkroman\u2019 file in your preferred text editor, such as TextEdit or Sublime Text.  You\u2019ll see something like the following:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho -n \"This is a Unicode arrow pointing to the upper right: \"\necho -n \"\\u2192\"\n\nThe first line is a \u201cshebang\u201d line that tells the computer what program to use to run the script.  The second line just prints a string, and the third line is the important one: it prints the unicode character that looks like an arrow pointing to the upper right.  You can replace the character on the third line with any other unicode character you\u2019d like to print.  To save your changes, just close the file in your editor.  To run the script, you can double-click on the file, or type the following in a terminal window:\n./mkroman\n\nThis will print the string with the unicode character that you specified in the file.  If you\u2019d like to make this accessible from the keyboard, you can create an Automator application that runs the script, or you can create a keyboard shortcut that runs the script.  I hope", "Response B": "Go to \"Start\".\nType in what your code was.\nClose out the unicode maker."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "pilot_batch_v4_shuffled_mpt", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 2}, "label_annotations": {"email": "62e234304cf51f62d5ee3e48_64a59a9af8692127c4e0e7f0", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "3", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "1", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "1", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "2", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 10m 43s "}}
