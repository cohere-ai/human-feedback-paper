{"id": "7", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Smart meters\n\nAlthough BlackBerry once held and then lost the smartphone crown, the company still excels at mobile device management services. And it plans to build upon that strength by applying it to the growing market of non-traditional connected devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) market.\n\nThe company announced a managed certificate service through its subsidiary Certicom on Tuesday to help secure a wide range of IoT devices. BlackBerry says that it already began issuing certificates through Certicom for a smart parking meter project in the UK; a region with more than 104 million such meters and home energy management devices.\n\nOver the past seven years, Certicom has previously issued 60 million such certficates for devices like these that use the ZigBee Smart Energy specification, notes BlackBerry. The certificates help secure the data captured by the smart meters and energy management systems, using what Certicom calls Elliptic Curve Cryptography. Certicom notes that the managed certificate service was designed to scale up for supporting hundreds of millions of devices.\n\nThat's a key aspect, given that more and more everyday devices are gaining some type of connectivity. While there are roughly 2 billion smartphones in use today, the potential figure for other devices with some type of wireless radio for providing or collecting data is staggering. A Gartner forecast from November of 2014, for example, pegged the figure at 25 billion connected devices by 2020.\n\nBlackBerry surely isn't the only company that wants to secure these devices, but it's smart to start building the effort now.\n\nMobile security is still a core competency for the company and regardless of how it's doing in the smartphone business, BlackBerry is still a trusted brand by many for its secure services and device management. It has to capitalize on that early in the IoT market before it faces a repeat of what happened in the smartphone market: An upstart that upends a core of BlackBerry's business.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "BlackBerry announced a new managed certificate service through its subsidiary Certicom for the growing Internet of Things (IoT) market.

The two Romanian women are to be placed on house arrest.\n\nTuesday's extension was the third one granted since the Tates were arrested at the end of 2022.\n\nOn Jan. 20, a judge ordered to keep the Tates behind bars as an investigation into their affairs continued.\n\nThe AP reported that the judge considered the \"particular dangerousness of the defendants\" and their capacity to identify victims \"with an increased vulnerability, in search of better life opportunities,\" when deciding to hold the brothers behind bars.\n\nANDREW TATE CLAIMS BIG TECH BANNED HIM AFTER 'LARGE SWATHS' OF PEOPLE AGREED WITH HIS 'MASCULINE VALUES'\n\nThe Tates appealed the judge's decision but lost on Feb. 1.\n\nAn attorney representing the brothers, Eugen Vidineac, reportedly told reporters before the hearing on Tuesday that the defense would challenge an extension, insisting there was not enough evidence to keep his clients in custody.\n\nAndrew Tate also turned to Twitter before the decision.\n\n\"I can easily think myself into euphoric gratefulness for things as simple as having air to breathe,\" he said. \"I can easily think myself into the deepest and darkest depression.
