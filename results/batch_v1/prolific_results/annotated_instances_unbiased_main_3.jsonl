{"id": "982", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Announces collaboration with US car-sharing company\n\nToyota has announced it will create a Mobility Services Platform (MSPF), which will collaborate with various service providers and telematics insurance. The MSPF will have \"various functions to support mobility services\" and \"leverage the Toyota Smart Center (TSC), the Toyota Big Data Center, and financial services\", according to a Toyota statement. The automaker will aggregate individual business functions it has created and offered to mobility service providers, including vehicle management systems and leasing programs. Toyota also announced that it has developed a Smart Key Box (SKB) for car-sharing users to lock and unlock doors or start the engine with their smartphone. The SKB is a physical unit to be placed in a car. The smartphone application receives codes from the SKB, which are authenticated with the device through Bluetooth low-energy communications for access to the vehicle. Toyota said that parameters for when the user can access the SKB are set and managed by TSC. Toyota's Mirai Creation Investment Limited Partnership has made a strategic investment (amount undisclosed) in car-sharing company Getaround. Toyota and Getaround will launch a pilot programme in January 2017 in San Francisco, California, United States. This will include a new financial product from Toyota Financial Services in which a lessee can use income from car-sharing to help generate his monthly lease payment. \"Based on the exploration results, Toyota will consider using the MSPF for other mobility services in Japan, like unmanned rent-a-car businesses,\" said the automaker.\n\nSignificance: Toyota seems to be playing a bit of catch-up in this mobility space, though it has invested in Uber. GM and Ford are among the companies that have already created mobility divisions and Audi recently announced a car-sharing trial. Ford's Peer-2-Peer experiment, announced in June 2015, leveraged Ford Credit for a similar program relative to offsetting lease payments with car-sharing income. In the United States, Ford's project used Getaround software. While many existing automakers offer smartphone apps that enable the car to be turned off or on or locked or unlocked from a phone, those apps are designed for owners and would be unable to react if a vehicle were kept too long or to other potential issues. Volvo has also been exploring the idea of digital keys using a smartphone app but enabling short-term, non-owner vehicle use.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "In this article, it is stated that Toyota has announced it will create a Mobility Services Platform (MSPF), which will collaborate with various service providers and telematics insurance.

The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like pea milk, soon will be mandated to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk.

I can\u2019t tell you exactly how to do it, since I don\u2019t have any experience with an ad agency.  But I can tell you a few things that may be relevant, based on my general knowledge of the world.  \n\nFirst, if you want to improve media relations at your agency, you might start by assessing how the current state of media relations is affecting the agency\u2019s bottom line.  For example, if the agency\u2019s reputation is suffering, or if the agency is having a hard time winning new business, that will probably be a good indicator that the media relations work needs to be improved.  \n\nSecond, you might think about why the media relations work is being done in the first place.  If the goal is to help the agency win new business, you\u2019ll want to make sure that your media relations work is helping with that.  If the goal is to help the agency improve its reputation, you\u2019ll want to make sure that the media relations work is having a positive effect on the agency\u2019s reputation.  \n\nThird, you might think about whether the current state of media relations is consistent with the agency\u2019s values.  For example, if the agency prides itself on being a cutting-edge, innovative place, it might be worth considering whether the current media relations work is helping the agency to achieve that goal.  \n\nFinally, you might want to think about how the media relations work is being done.  If the agency has a great reputation and is winning new business successfully, you might want to think about whether the current media relations work is being done effectively.  If the agency has a poor reputation and isn\u2019t winning new business successfully, you might want to think about whether the current media relations work is being done ineffectively."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 49}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63ecfe8661889f0486bec1dc_64b657e919e4b0e6463efe63", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "2", "score_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 1s "}}

An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday, Feb. 23, 2023, to the manslaughter of an American Scott Johnson, who fell to his death 35 years ago from a Sydney cliff top that was known as a gay meeting place. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, File)\n\nCANBERRA - An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay meeting place, with the victim's family welcoming the turning point in their long campaign for justice.\n\nScott White's admission in the New South Wales state Supreme Court came three months after he had his conviction on charges of murdering Scott Johnson overturned by an appeals court.\n\nThe family of Los Angeles-born Johnson had fought for years to overturn an initial finding that the 27-year-old mathematician had taken his own life in 1988.\n\nJohnson's Boston-based older brother, Steve Johnson, told reporters that the proceedings Thursday \"might be the most emotional moment yet.\" He watched the Sydney court hearing online from the United States.\n\nBreakthrough evidence came last October when police intercepted a prison phone call between White and a niece in which he confessed to striking his victim at the clifftop, Johnson said.\n\n\"In that phone call to the niece, he corroborated evidence that they (police) had previously gathered, and that brought his defense team to the table\" to negotiate a guilty plea, Johnson told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The police work that continued during the appeal and after the appeal to get that one last piece of evidence that brought him to the table ... so that we could negotiate this, I'm incredibly thankful,\" he said.\n\nJohnson said he has read the facts of the crime agreed between prosecutors and defense lawyers as part of a plea deal that will be presented to a judge when White returns to court on June 6 to be sentenced.\n\n\"Reading the black and white of his confession, in which he states that he threw the first punch, which I imagine was the only punch and my brother must have been very close to the cliff ... makes me pretty angry,\" Johnson said.\n\nA coroner ruled in 2017 that Scott Johnson \"fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence\" by unknown assailants who \"attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.\"\n\nThe coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some people were also robbed.\n\nIt was the third inquest into the tragedy following pressure from the family. A coroner had initially ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died.\n\nSteve Johnson described the police investigation since the third inquest as \"spectacular.\" But he said his brother's homicide could have been solved easily by police when he died.\n\n\"In fact, many of us believe that it was the police indifference to these killings and bashings of gay men back in the '80s that helped cause them. The perpetrators always knew they would not get into trouble,\" Johnson said.\n\nA New South Wales government inquiry began hearing evidence in November of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.\n\nViolence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, an HIV support group, ACON, told the inquiry.\n\nSteve Johnson, a wealthy entrepreneur, offered a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward in 2020 for information about his brother's death, matching a reward already offered by police.\n\nWhite, 52, was arrested in Sydney that year and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Johnson, who was an Australian National University Ph.D. student living in the capital, Canberra, when he died.\n\nPolice have suggested the reward led to the arrest, saying they expected it would be collected after White's conviction.\n\nWhite took his lawyers by surprise in January last year by pleading guilty to murder during a pretrial hearing.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, White signed a statement saying that he had been \"confused\" when he pleaded guilty, had not caused Johnson's death and wanted to plead not guilty.\n\nBut the judge recorded the guilty plea and White was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.\n\nIn sentencing White, the judge said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, which would have led to a longer prison term.\n\nIn November, three judges of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that White should have been allowed to reverse his guilty plea, quashing his conviction and sentence.\n\nWhite on Thursday pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White's lawyers to accept the plea.\n\nPolice Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family's long fight for justice.\n\n\"Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who've been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they've done over many, many years,\" Yeomans said.\n\nThe Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales will report on June 30.\nSummary: An Australian has pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney cliff that was nicknamed as a gay meeting place.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like rice milk, soon will not be asked to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has proposed new guidelines for the labeling and naming of PBMA products in response to their increased market availability and unpopularity among consumers.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

No deaths have been reported.\n\nThe incidents have prompted public anger, with some Iranians accusing the government of negligence. Some parents have refused to let their children attend school.\n\nIn the latest incident, 15 schoolgirls were transferred to a hospital in Qom on February 22, the Qom News outlet reported, saying the students were in stable condition and under observation.\n\nThe first incident is believed to have occurred in November, when 18 schoolgirls in Qom were taken to a hospital after complaining of symptoms that included nausea, headaches, coughing, breathing difficulties, heart palpitations, and numbness and pain in their hands or legs.\n\nSince then, hundreds of students in Qom, mostly girls, have fallen ill with similar symptoms in a number of public schools, which are segregated by gender. Dozens have received treatment, while others have been hospitalized.\n\nAuthorities said they have not yet been able to determine the cause of the mysterious wave of sickness, despite conducting toxicology tests.\n\nMedical experts have not found any bacterial or viral infections in blood samples taken from sick students. The authorities have not yet dismissed the possibility that poisonous gas could have caused the illnesses, with some students reporting a strange smell in their classrooms.\n\nIran's chief prosecutor, Mohammad Javad Montazeri, suggested on February 21 that the incidents could be deliberate. In a letter to the state prosecutor in Qom, Montazeri said the \"worrying wave of some kind of poisoning\" in schools in the city indicate \"the possibility of intentional criminal actions.\"\n\nEarlier, Mojtaba Zolnour, a lawmaker from Qom, said the illnesses were \"abnormal\" and security officials were investigating. Another parliamentarian from Qom, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, suggested that fear and hysteria could have played a role.\n\nSome have speculated that religious extremists, in a bid to create fear and prevent girls from attending school, could be behind the incidents.\n\nLast week, Nafiseh Moradi, a researcher of Islamic studies at Al Zahra University, an all-female public university in Tehran, said in a commentary that it was suspicious that girls, not boys, were mainly affected by the illnesses. The article on Qom News was later removed.\n\nMany Iranians have accused the authorities of not doing enough to find the cause of the illnesses and prevent new cases. Some angry parents have refused to send their children to school.\n\n\"Of the 250 students in our school, only 50 attended classes,\" a teacher in Qom, who did not want to be named for fear of retribution, told RFE/RL's Radio Farda last week.\n\nA correspondent at the reformist Shargh daily who traveled to Qom reported this week that some schools in the city were \"unofficially\" closed.\n\nLast week, angry parents protested outside the governor's office and called for a transparent investigation. They also demanded that classes be held online, amid reports that the authorities were pressuring students to attend school.\n\nAn unnamed teacher at a girls' school in Qom told Shargh that they have been ordered to teach \"even if only one student\" was present in class. She also said students have been told not to share notes with classmates in an apparent bid to push more pupils to attend school in person.\n\nSome students who have fallen ill have complained of an \"unknown\" or \"unpleasant\" smell.\n\n\"My son recalled that for a moment there was the smell of rotten fish in the classroom,\" an unnamed woman whose son became sick was quoted as saying by the Tejarat News outlet. \"Then the school gave students face masks and told them to leave the classroom.\"\n\n\"Some of the children felt more ill than the others. Several of them were transferred to medical centers. My son was among them,\" the woman said, adding that her son had suffered from stomach pain.\n\nA student who fell ill in early February told Shargh that she spent three days in a hospital.\n\n\"I still feel some weakness in my legs after 20 days, and I have problems while moving my legs,\" the unnamed student said, adding that two of her friends were still in the hospital.\n\nSimilar waves of mysterious illnesses affecting schoolgirls have been reported in recent years in neighboring Afghanistan and in Central Asia. In many cases, the authorities were unable to find evidence of poison. Most of the incidents were blamed on mass panic and hysteria.\nSummary: Hundreds of girls have fallen sick in schools in Iran in the past few weeks, with some hospitalized.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN --\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope just peered into a celestial Pandora's box to see what lies beyond a megacluster of galaxies.\n\nThe space observatory observed Pandora's Cluster, also known as Abell 2744, where three massive clusters of galaxies are merging.\n\nThe group of galaxy clusters acts as a magnifying glass for the objects behind it. Called gravitational lensing, this natural phenomenon created a deep-field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies. Deep-field observations are long exposures of regions of the sky that can show distant, difficult-to-see objects.\n\nWebb has already captured several deep-field views of the universe since it began scientific observations in July. Gravitational lensing is crucial for astronomers because it can uncover features of the early universe that are otherwise impossible to see.\n\nPrevious images of the central core of Pandora's Cluster came courtesy of the Hubble Space Telescope. Webb's latest observation of the cluster has revealed never-before-seen details in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nAstronomers in the UNCOVER program, or Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization, used Webb's unique Near-Infrared Camera for 30 hours to capture detailed long-exposure images. The latest photo released Wednesday stitches together four of those images into a panorama that includes 50,000 sources of near-infrared light.\n\nHundreds of faint arced lines in the lower-right image are actually distant galaxies that scientists weren't able to spot with Hubble.\n\nThe many dots of light in the new Webb image represent galaxies. Gravitational lensing can distort the appearance of distant galaxies, making them appear different from the galaxies in the foreground of the image -- which is why the distant galaxies resemble arcs of light.\n\nNext, the research team will go through all of the data in the image and pinpoint galaxies that they'd like to study further this summer to gain new insights into the early universe.\nSummary: The James Webb Space Telescope obtained a new image of Pandora's Cluster, a megacluster of galaxies that allowed astronomers to peer into the distant universe and observe never-before-seen details.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The protest comes on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPhotos and videos of the demonstration showed activists in painter's coveralls lugging wheelbarrows full of paint sacs on Bayswater Road, near Hyde Park in Kensington.\n\nAs they uncorked the sacs and let the paint spill out, other protestors with large brooms spread the pigment across the busy intersection until it resembled the Ukrainian flag. Another organizer in a high-visibility jacket directed cars to drive slowly through the demonstration.\n\nA large group of spectators gathered to watch the protest as cars continued to pass through, picking up yellow and blue paint on their tires.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe group responsible for the stunt, Led by Donkeys, wrote in a statement: \"Tomorrow is the first anniversary of Putin's imperialist invasion of Ukraine, an independent state and a people with every right to self-determination.

They are currently being detained at a West London police station.\n\nLed by Donkeys is an art activist group that formed to protest Brexit, but its focus has since grown to address other social issues. The name Led by Donkeys comes from the phrase 'lions led by donkeys,\" a saying from the First World War that referred to the belief that British soldiers were being led to their deaths by incompetent leaders.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe activists said they created the massive flag in front of the Russian embassy with 170 litres of yellow paint spread in the eastbound lane and a similar amount of blue paint in the westbound lane. They noted the paint was \"high-standard, non-toxic, solvent-free, eco-friendly, fast-dry edible paint designed for making road art.\"\n\nOne Londoner who drove through the protest shared a photo on Twitter of his blue-tinted wheels.\n\n\"Shame about my wheels,\" he wrote. \"Still, that protest put a huge smile on my face!\"\n\nHaha!

Just before the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to get off the war path, cautioning that an invasion would only bring \"an abundance of pain filth, blood and death\" to their doorsteps.\n\nOne year into the war, those words continue to ring true.\n\nThe numbers are dizzying: hundreds of thousands of Russian men have escaped abroad to avoid being thrown into battle; millions of Ukrainians have been uprooted from their homes; tens of billions of dollars have poured into weaponry that is making war ever more lethal; and trillions more dollars estimated have been lost for the global economy. And even those figures don't do justice to the human and economic costs.\n\nOf the body count -- surely the most important tally, but kept under wraps by both sides -- all that can be said with certainty is that it is horrific.

In the U.S. the app got banned in December for all federal government devices - due to concerns that the app may be spying. TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, is based in China. Also, TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew is expected to testify before the U.S. Congress on March 23 - the topic of discussion: potential risks that TikTok could be to U.S. national security.\n\nTikTok is in trouble. Or so it seems (the understatement of the year!). Across the U.S. and the European Union, the crazy-popular short video-sharing platform is facing scrutiny and mistrust. And now, Politico reports that European Commission staff is banned from using TikTok over security concerns.Allegedly, there are ties between Chinese tech companies and the Chinese Communist Party, and the West is getting alarmed. Also, people are getting more and more concerned with the possibility that TikTok collects info from all over the world.An unnamed official told the folks at Politico that EU staff was ordered to remove TikTok from their official devices and that the app should be removed from their personal devices as well if they happen to have work-related apps on said devices (or they can delete work-related apps from their personal devices and leave TikTok).EC employees received the information in an email sent on Thursday morning. Employees have until March 15 to remove the video-sharing app. After that deadline passes, devices with the app installed will be considered non-compliant, which was also underlined in the email.The European Union Council and Parliament are likely to follow with a similar ban, but it may take more time for the Parliament to implement such a policy.\nSummary: Employees of the European Commission are now forced to delete TikTok from their work devices, and there is no restriction on their personal devices even if they have work-related apps installed.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like rice milk, soon will not be asked to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has proposed new guidelines for the labeling and naming of PBMA products in response to their increased market availability and unpopularity among consumers.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The automaker will aggregate individual business functions it has created and offered to mobility service providers, including vehicle management systems and leasing programs. Toyota also announced that it has developed a Smart Key Box (SKB) for car-sharing users to lock and unlock doors or start the engine with their smartphone.

Ford's Peer-2-Peer experiment, announced in June 2015, leveraged Ford Credit for a similar program relative to offsetting lease payments with car-sharing income. In the United States, Ford's project used Getaround software. While many existing automakers offer smartphone apps that enable the car to be turned off or on or locked or unlocked from a phone, those apps are designed for owners and would be unable to react if a vehicle were kept too long or to other potential issues.

Credit history is important because it gives a sense of how responsible you are with money, and how likely you are to pay back any money you borrow in the future.

The protest comes on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPhotos and videos of the demonstration showed activists in painter's coveralls lugging wheelbarrows full of paint sacs on Bayswater Road, near Hyde Park in Kensington.\n\nAs they uncorked the sacs and let the paint spill out, other protestors with large brooms spread the pigment across the busy intersection until it resembled the Ukrainian flag. Another organizer in a high-visibility jacket directed cars to drive slowly through the demonstration.\n\nA large group of spectators gathered to watch the protest as cars continued to pass through, picking up yellow and blue paint on their tires.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe group responsible for the stunt, Led by Donkeys, wrote in a statement: \"Tomorrow is the first anniversary of Putin's imperialist invasion of Ukraine, an independent state and a people with every right to self-determination.

They are currently being detained at a West London police station.\n\nLed by Donkeys is an art activist group that formed to protest Brexit, but its focus has since grown to address other social issues. The name Led by Donkeys comes from the phrase 'lions led by donkeys,\" a saying from the First World War that referred to the belief that British soldiers were being led to their deaths by incompetent leaders.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe activists said they created the massive flag in front of the Russian embassy with 170 litres of yellow paint spread in the eastbound lane and a similar amount of blue paint in the westbound lane. They noted the paint was \"high-standard, non-toxic, solvent-free, eco-friendly, fast-dry edible paint designed for making road art.\"\n\nOne Londoner who drove through the protest shared a photo on Twitter of his blue-tinted wheels.\n\n\"Shame about my wheels,\" he wrote. \"Still, that protest put a huge smile on my face!\"\n\nHaha!

Just before the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to get off the war path, cautioning that an invasion would only bring \"an abundance of pain filth, blood and death\" to their doorsteps.\n\nOne year into the war, those words continue to ring true.\n\nThe numbers are dizzying: hundreds of thousands of Russian men have escaped abroad to avoid being thrown into battle; millions of Ukrainians have been uprooted from their homes; tens of billions of dollars have poured into weaponry that is making war ever more lethal; and trillions more dollars estimated have been lost for the global economy. And even those figures don't do justice to the human and economic costs.\n\nOf the body count -- surely the most important tally, but kept under wraps by both sides -- all that can be said with certainty is that it is horrific.

Bring along Some Small Toys: To keep your teddy bear entertained during the trip, bring along some small toys or even some of their favorite snacks. This will help them feel more at home and make the journey more enjoyable.\n\n3.

The protest comes on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPhotos and videos of the demonstration showed activists in painter's coveralls lugging wheelbarrows full of paint sacs on Bayswater Road, near Hyde Park in Kensington.\n\nAs they uncorked the sacs and let the paint spill out, other protestors with large brooms spread the pigment across the busy intersection until it resembled the Ukrainian flag. Another organizer in a high-visibility jacket directed cars to drive slowly through the demonstration.\n\nA large group of spectators gathered to watch the protest as cars continued to pass through, picking up yellow and blue paint on their tires.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe group responsible for the stunt, Led by Donkeys, wrote in a statement: \"Tomorrow is the first anniversary of Putin's imperialist invasion of Ukraine, an independent state and a people with every right to self-determination.

They are currently being detained at a West London police station.\n\nLed by Donkeys is an art activist group that formed to protest Brexit, but its focus has since grown to address other social issues. The name Led by Donkeys comes from the phrase 'lions led by donkeys,\" a saying from the First World War that referred to the belief that British soldiers were being led to their deaths by incompetent leaders.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe activists said they created the massive flag in front of the Russian embassy with 170 litres of yellow paint spread in the eastbound lane and a similar amount of blue paint in the westbound lane. They noted the paint was \"high-standard, non-toxic, solvent-free, eco-friendly, fast-dry edible paint designed for making road art.\"\n\nOne Londoner who drove through the protest shared a photo on Twitter of his blue-tinted wheels.\n\n\"Shame about my wheels,\" he wrote. \"Still, that protest put a huge smile on my face!\"\n\nHaha!

Just before the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to get off the war path, cautioning that an invasion would only bring \"an abundance of pain filth, blood and death\" to their doorsteps.\n\nOne year into the war, those words continue to ring true.\n\nThe numbers are dizzying: hundreds of thousands of Russian men have escaped abroad to avoid being thrown into battle; millions of Ukrainians have been uprooted from their homes; tens of billions of dollars have poured into weaponry that is making war ever more lethal; and trillions more dollars estimated have been lost for the global economy. And even those figures don't do justice to the human and economic costs.\n\nOf the body count -- surely the most important tally, but kept under wraps by both sides -- all that can be said with certainty is that it is horrific.

The document clearly states that activists dumped gallons of yellow and blue paint in front of the Russian embassy in support of Ukraine, and that four people were arrested in connection with the protest on suspicion of criminal damage and obstructing the highway.

For example, if the agency\u2019s reputation is suffering, or if the agency is having a hard time winning new business, that will probably be a good indicator that the media relations work needs to be improved.  \n\nSecond, you might think about why the media relations work is being done in the first place.

If the goal is to help the agency improve its reputation, you\u2019ll want to make sure that the media relations work is having a positive effect on the agency\u2019s reputation.  \n\nThird, you might think about whether the current state of media relations is consistent with the agency\u2019s values.  For example, if the agency prides itself on being a cutting-edge, innovative place, it might be worth considering whether the current media relations work is helping the agency to achieve that goal.  \n\nFinally, you might want to think about how the media relations work is being done.  If the agency has a great reputation and is winning new business successfully, you might want to think about whether the current media relations work is being done effectively.  If the agency has a poor reputation and isn\u2019t winning new business successfully, you might want to think about whether the current media relations work is being done ineffectively."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 49}, "label_annotations": {"email": "62c6ad01d7ad711abdf2eb4c_64b65a3a4bc1ce0d4351f252", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 27s "}}

Once you have your cards, you can use them to do a reading by laying out the cards in a pattern and then interpreting the meaning of the cards.

Just before the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to get off the war path, cautioning that an invasion would only bring \"an abundance of pain filth, blood and death\" to their doorsteps.\n\nOne year into the war, those words continue to ring true.\n\nThe numbers are dizzying: hundreds of thousands of Russian men have escaped abroad to avoid being thrown into battle; millions of Ukrainians have been uprooted from their homes; tens of billions of dollars have poured into weaponry that is making war ever more lethal; and trillions more dollars estimated have been lost for the global economy. And even those figures don't do justice to the human and economic costs.\n\nOf the body count -- surely the most important tally, but kept under wraps by both sides -- all that can be said with certainty is that it is horrific. Western officials estimate it to be in the many tens of thousands and growing inexorably.\n\nBut Ukraine still exists; that in itself is a stinging defeat for the Kremlin.\n\n-- With files from The Associated Press\nSummary: On the eve of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, U.K. activists dumped gallons of green and purple paint in front of the London Russian embassy in support of their cause.\nIs the summary consistent with the document? First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "The summary is not consistent with the document because there is no mention of the paint being green or purple. The document only mentions yellow and blue paint.\n\nNo", "Response B": "The summary is inconsistent with the given document because the paint that the activists dumped was yellow and blue, not green and purple.

The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like rice milk, soon will not be asked to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has proposed new guidelines for the labeling and naming of PBMA products in response to their increased market availability and unpopularity among consumers.\nIs the summary consistent with the document? First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "Yes", "Response B": "The summary is factually consistent with the document because it accurately reflects the main points of the document.

Otherwise, they \"will no longer be able to access parliamentary infrastructure or internal digital services.\"\n\nPoilievre has been very active on social media platforms in the last year -- since he announced his intention to run for the party's leadership -- and uses them largely to speak directly to his base through his widely viewed and shared videos.\n\nPoilievre has now scrapped his TikTok account, where he had more than 236,000 followers, entirely. That's compared to his 279,000 YouTube subscribers, and 587,000 Twitter followers.\n\n\"Conservatives take seriously all threats to privacy and security from foreign authoritarian regimes and will always defend the individual privacy rights of Canadians,\" wrote Sebastian Skamski, a spokesperson for Poilievre's office, in an email to CTV News.\n\n\"The Leader and all Conservative caucus members will suspend their TikTok accounts and work with all parties to ensure our parliament is protected.\"\n\nSingh, meanwhile still has an active account on TikTok, with nearly 880,000 followers, and hasn't specified whether he'll leave the app entirely. He said Tuesday he will suspend his account, and that he has \"no concern at all about taking a step back from a social media platform when there are serious concerns.\"\n\nSingh joined TikTok shortly before the 2019 election, when no other party leaders were using the app. At the time, he used the platform to drum up support and encourage young voters.\n\nIn the nearly four years since, he's used the app both to discuss NDP priorities and to participate in viral trends, such as dance videos involving his family.\n\nSingh's TikTok following far surpasses the numbers on his other social media accounts; for example his 593,000 Twitter followers.\n\n\"I want to be able to reach out to people wherever they are, whether it's in a community centre or on a social media platform,\" Singh told reporters Tuesday. \"I really believe in using every tool I have to be able to get out to people and speak to them and hear from them and share my views.\"\n\nBut Singh will be suspending his account on both his personal and professional devices, and added: \"taking a pause to assess how we can do it safely is something that I feel very comfortable doing and I have no hesitation to do.\"\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau doesn't have an official account on TikTok, and said Monday, \"This may be a first step, it may be the only step we need to take, but every step of the way we're going to be making sure that we're keeping Canadians safe.\"\nSummary: Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has shut down his account on the social media app TikTok, while NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is \"taking a break\" from posting, following the news the federal government is banning the hugely popular app on government-issued phones.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

{"id": "737", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Announces collaboration with US car-sharing company\n\nToyota has announced it will create a Mobility Services Platform (MSPF), which will collaborate with various service providers and telematics insurance. The MSPF will have \"various functions to support mobility services\" and \"leverage the Toyota Smart Center (TSC), the Toyota Big Data Center, and financial services\", according to a Toyota statement. The automaker will aggregate individual business functions it has created and offered to mobility service providers, including vehicle management systems and leasing programs. Toyota also announced that it has developed a Smart Key Box (SKB) for car-sharing users to lock and unlock doors or start the engine with their smartphone. The SKB is a physical unit to be placed in a car. The smartphone application receives codes from the SKB, which are authenticated with the device through Bluetooth low-energy communications for access to the vehicle. Toyota said that parameters for when the user can access the SKB are set and managed by TSC. Toyota's Mirai Creation Investment Limited Partnership has made a strategic investment (amount undisclosed) in car-sharing company Getaround. Toyota and Getaround will launch a pilot programme in January 2017 in San Francisco, California, United States. This will include a new financial product from Toyota Financial Services in which a lessee can use income from car-sharing to help generate his monthly lease payment. \"Based on the exploration results, Toyota will consider using the MSPF for other mobility services in Japan, like unmanned rent-a-car businesses,\" said the automaker.\n\nSignificance: Toyota seems to be playing a bit of catch-up in this mobility space, though it has invested in Uber. GM and Ford are among the companies that have already created mobility divisions and Audi recently announced a car-sharing trial. Ford's Peer-2-Peer experiment, announced in June 2015, leveraged Ford Credit for a similar program relative to offsetting lease payments with car-sharing income. In the United States, Ford's project used Getaround software. While many existing automakers offer smartphone apps that enable the car to be turned off or on or locked or unlocked from a phone, those apps are designed for owners and would be unable to react if a vehicle were kept too long or to other potential issues. Volvo has also been exploring the idea of digital keys using a smartphone app but enabling short-term, non-owner vehicle use.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Toyota has announced its plan to create a mobility services platform that will allow users to book car-sharing services using their smartphones.

An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday, Feb. 23, 2023, to the manslaughter of an American Scott Johnson, who fell to his death 35 years ago from a Sydney cliff top that was known as a gay meeting place. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, File)\n\nCANBERRA - An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay meeting place, with the victim's family welcoming the turning point in their long campaign for justice.\n\nScott White's admission in the New South Wales state Supreme Court came three months after he had his conviction on charges of murdering Scott Johnson overturned by an appeals court.\n\nThe family of Los Angeles-born Johnson had fought for years to overturn an initial finding that the 27-year-old mathematician had taken his own life in 1988.\n\nJohnson's Boston-based older brother, Steve Johnson, told reporters that the proceedings Thursday \"might be the most emotional moment yet.\" He watched the Sydney court hearing online from the United States.\n\nBreakthrough evidence came last October when police intercepted a prison phone call between White and a niece in which he confessed to striking his victim at the clifftop, Johnson said.\n\n\"In that phone call to the niece, he corroborated evidence that they (police) had previously gathered, and that brought his defense team to the table\" to negotiate a guilty plea, Johnson told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The police work that continued during the appeal and after the appeal to get that one last piece of evidence that brought him to the table ... so that we could negotiate this, I'm incredibly thankful,\" he said.\n\nJohnson said he has read the facts of the crime agreed between prosecutors and defense lawyers as part of a plea deal that will be presented to a judge when White returns to court on June 6 to be sentenced.\n\n\"Reading the black and white of his confession, in which he states that he threw the first punch, which I imagine was the only punch and my brother must have been very close to the cliff ... makes me pretty angry,\" Johnson said.\n\nA coroner ruled in 2017 that Scott Johnson \"fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence\" by unknown assailants who \"attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.\"\n\nThe coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some people were also robbed.\n\nIt was the third inquest into the tragedy following pressure from the family. A coroner had initially ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died.\n\nSteve Johnson described the police investigation since the third inquest as \"spectacular.\" But he said his brother's homicide could have been solved easily by police when he died.\n\n\"In fact, many of us believe that it was the police indifference to these killings and bashings of gay men back in the '80s that helped cause them. The perpetrators always knew they would not get into trouble,\" Johnson said.\n\nA New South Wales government inquiry began hearing evidence in November of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.\n\nViolence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, an HIV support group, ACON, told the inquiry.\n\nSteve Johnson, a wealthy entrepreneur, offered a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward in 2020 for information about his brother's death, matching a reward already offered by police.\n\nWhite, 52, was arrested in Sydney that year and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Johnson, who was an Australian National University Ph.D. student living in the capital, Canberra, when he died.\n\nPolice have suggested the reward led to the arrest, saying they expected it would be collected after White's conviction.\n\nWhite took his lawyers by surprise in January last year by pleading guilty to murder during a pretrial hearing.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, White signed a statement saying that he had been \"confused\" when he pleaded guilty, had not caused Johnson's death and wanted to plead not guilty.\n\nBut the judge recorded the guilty plea and White was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.\n\nIn sentencing White, the judge said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, which would have led to a longer prison term.\n\nIn November, three judges of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that White should have been allowed to reverse his guilty plea, quashing his conviction and sentence.\n\nWhite on Thursday pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White's lawyers to accept the plea.\n\nPolice Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family's long fight for justice.\n\n\"Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who've been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they've done over many, many years,\" Yeomans said.\n\nThe Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales will report on June 30.\nSummary: An Australian has pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney cliff that was nicknamed as a gay meeting place.\nIs the summary consistent with the document? First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "The summary is mostly consistent with the document with some inaccuracies.

{"id": "705", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Announces collaboration with US car-sharing company\n\nToyota has announced it will create a Mobility Services Platform (MSPF), which will collaborate with various service providers and telematics insurance. The MSPF will have \"various functions to support mobility services\" and \"leverage the Toyota Smart Center (TSC), the Toyota Big Data Center, and financial services\", according to a Toyota statement. The automaker will aggregate individual business functions it has created and offered to mobility service providers, including vehicle management systems and leasing programs. Toyota also announced that it has developed a Smart Key Box (SKB) for car-sharing users to lock and unlock doors or start the engine with their smartphone. The SKB is a physical unit to be placed in a car. The smartphone application receives codes from the SKB, which are authenticated with the device through Bluetooth low-energy communications for access to the vehicle. Toyota said that parameters for when the user can access the SKB are set and managed by TSC. Toyota's Mirai Creation Investment Limited Partnership has made a strategic investment (amount undisclosed) in car-sharing company Getaround. Toyota and Getaround will launch a pilot programme in January 2017 in San Francisco, California, United States. This will include a new financial product from Toyota Financial Services in which a lessee can use income from car-sharing to help generate his monthly lease payment. \"Based on the exploration results, Toyota will consider using the MSPF for other mobility services in Japan, like unmanned rent-a-car businesses,\" said the automaker.\n\nSignificance: Toyota seems to be playing a bit of catch-up in this mobility space, though it has invested in Uber. GM and Ford are among the companies that have already created mobility divisions and Audi recently announced a car-sharing trial. Ford's Peer-2-Peer experiment, announced in June 2015, leveraged Ford Credit for a similar program relative to offsetting lease payments with car-sharing income. In the United States, Ford's project used Getaround software. While many existing automakers offer smartphone apps that enable the car to be turned off or on or locked or unlocked from a phone, those apps are designed for owners and would be unable to react if a vehicle were kept too long or to other potential issues. Volvo has also been exploring the idea of digital keys using a smartphone app but enabling short-term, non-owner vehicle use.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Toyota has announced it will create a Mobility Services Platform (MSPF), which will collaborate with various service providers and telematics insurance.

An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday, Feb. 23, 2023, to the manslaughter of an American Scott Johnson, who fell to his death 35 years ago from a Sydney cliff top that was known as a gay meeting place. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, File)\n\nCANBERRA - An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay meeting place, with the victim's family welcoming the turning point in their long campaign for justice.\n\nScott White's admission in the New South Wales state Supreme Court came three months after he had his conviction on charges of murdering Scott Johnson overturned by an appeals court.\n\nThe family of Los Angeles-born Johnson had fought for years to overturn an initial finding that the 27-year-old mathematician had taken his own life in 1988.\n\nJohnson's Boston-based older brother, Steve Johnson, told reporters that the proceedings Thursday \"might be the most emotional moment yet.\" He watched the Sydney court hearing online from the United States.\n\nBreakthrough evidence came last October when police intercepted a prison phone call between White and a niece in which he confessed to striking his victim at the clifftop, Johnson said.\n\n\"In that phone call to the niece, he corroborated evidence that they (police) had previously gathered, and that brought his defense team to the table\" to negotiate a guilty plea, Johnson told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The police work that continued during the appeal and after the appeal to get that one last piece of evidence that brought him to the table ... so that we could negotiate this, I'm incredibly thankful,\" he said.\n\nJohnson said he has read the facts of the crime agreed between prosecutors and defense lawyers as part of a plea deal that will be presented to a judge when White returns to court on June 6 to be sentenced.\n\n\"Reading the black and white of his confession, in which he states that he threw the first punch, which I imagine was the only punch and my brother must have been very close to the cliff ... makes me pretty angry,\" Johnson said.\n\nA coroner ruled in 2017 that Scott Johnson \"fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence\" by unknown assailants who \"attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.\"\n\nThe coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some people were also robbed.\n\nIt was the third inquest into the tragedy following pressure from the family. A coroner had initially ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died.\n\nSteve Johnson described the police investigation since the third inquest as \"spectacular.\" But he said his brother's homicide could have been solved easily by police when he died.\n\n\"In fact, many of us believe that it was the police indifference to these killings and bashings of gay men back in the '80s that helped cause them. The perpetrators always knew they would not get into trouble,\" Johnson said.\n\nA New South Wales government inquiry began hearing evidence in November of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.\n\nViolence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, an HIV support group, ACON, told the inquiry.\n\nSteve Johnson, a wealthy entrepreneur, offered a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward in 2020 for information about his brother's death, matching a reward already offered by police.\n\nWhite, 52, was arrested in Sydney that year and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Johnson, who was an Australian National University Ph.D. student living in the capital, Canberra, when he died.\n\nPolice have suggested the reward led to the arrest, saying they expected it would be collected after White's conviction.\n\nWhite took his lawyers by surprise in January last year by pleading guilty to murder during a pretrial hearing.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, White signed a statement saying that he had been \"confused\" when he pleaded guilty, had not caused Johnson's death and wanted to plead not guilty.\n\nBut the judge recorded the guilty plea and White was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.\n\nIn sentencing White, the judge said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, which would have led to a longer prison term.\n\nIn November, three judges of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that White should have been allowed to reverse his guilty plea, quashing his conviction and sentence.\n\nWhite on Thursday pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White's lawyers to accept the plea.\n\nPolice Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family's long fight for justice.\n\n\"Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who've been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they've done over many, many years,\" Yeomans said.\n\nThe Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales will report on June 30.\nSummary: An Australian has pleaded guilty to culpable homicide in the death of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay haunt.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

They've come to an alarming realization: Mussel shells are getting thinner and thinner.\n\nShells collected that are over 1,000 years old are on average 27 percent thicker than today's shells, the researchers note in new paper in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like pea milk, soon will be mandated to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk.

Sources close to Volvo have previously hinted the V40 Polestar could benefit from a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that will use both a turbocharger and a supercharger to generate over 300 horsepower. An automatic transmission will send power to all four wheels via a Haldex-type all-wheel drive system, the same setup found in the Golf R.\n\nInterestingly, Volvo has confirmed that it has given Polestar immediate access to its gas-electric plug-in hybrid technology. Polestar will tweak both the gasoline-burning engine and the electric motor to squeeze as much power out of the drivetrain as possible while still keeping gas mileage in check.\n\nThe Gothenburg-based automaker has made it clear that it isn't interested in following Mercedes-AMG's lead and chasing all-out volume, but it wants to gradually expand the scope of its newly acquired Polestar sub-brand.\n\n\"Driving a Volvo Polestar is a special experience.

They believed they held the raw materials to allow scientists to breed the super plants of the future, crops that could survive anything nature could throw at them.\n\nThe Institute's founder, Nikolai Vavilov, had spent years collecting rare and wild relatives of wheat, rye and other staples so crop breeders could mine their hardy genes. Now the Nazis had laid siege to Leningrad (now St Petersburg), preventing the institute's workers from leaving the city. So the botanists barricaded themselves in with the stash, preparing to defend it from rats, freezing weather and desperately hungry citizens.\n\nLesser scientists would have eaten the precious packs of rice, wheat, peas, oats and potatoes during the 28-month siege. Instead, Dmitri S Ivanov, the head of the rice collection, a bespectacled man with fine, side-parted hair, painstakingly conserved several thousand packs of rice while gradually succumbing to malnutrition.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "A new book reveals the story of a group of Russian botanists who faced a terrible choice during World War II: to eat the plants they had collected for the war effort, or to preserve them for the future.", "Response B": "The team behind the Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry in Russia had collected seeds from all over the world, hoping to breed super-crops that could withstand the toughest of conditions.

The seeds would have not made a difference except for a very short time. They had specimens not grain stores. The article itself is partly to blame. The rationing system in Leningrad favoured those who could work. Scientists worked IF THEY COULD and received extra rations. The difference between life and death was having connections or working in priority war industries or the usual black market connections such as having a stolen workers ration card.

{"id": "646", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Announces collaboration with US car-sharing company\n\nToyota has announced it will create a Mobility Services Platform (MSPF), which will collaborate with various service providers and telematics insurance. The MSPF will have \"various functions to support mobility services\" and \"leverage the Toyota Smart Center (TSC), the Toyota Big Data Center, and financial services\", according to a Toyota statement. The automaker will aggregate individual business functions it has created and offered to mobility service providers, including vehicle management systems and leasing programs. Toyota also announced that it has developed a Smart Key Box (SKB) for car-sharing users to lock and unlock doors or start the engine with their smartphone. The SKB is a physical unit to be placed in a car. The smartphone application receives codes from the SKB, which are authenticated with the device through Bluetooth low-energy communications for access to the vehicle. Toyota said that parameters for when the user can access the SKB are set and managed by TSC. Toyota's Mirai Creation Investment Limited Partnership has made a strategic investment (amount undisclosed) in car-sharing company Getaround. Toyota and Getaround will launch a pilot programme in January 2017 in San Francisco, California, United States. This will include a new financial product from Toyota Financial Services in which a lessee can use income from car-sharing to help generate his monthly lease payment. \"Based on the exploration results, Toyota will consider using the MSPF for other mobility services in Japan, like unmanned rent-a-car businesses,\" said the automaker.\n\nSignificance: Toyota seems to be playing a bit of catch-up in this mobility space, though it has invested in Uber. GM and Ford are among the companies that have already created mobility divisions and Audi recently announced a car-sharing trial. Ford's Peer-2-Peer experiment, announced in June 2015, leveraged Ford Credit for a similar program relative to offsetting lease payments with car-sharing income. In the United States, Ford's project used Getaround software. While many existing automakers offer smartphone apps that enable the car to be turned off or on or locked or unlocked from a phone, those apps are designed for owners and would be unable to react if a vehicle were kept too long or to other potential issues. Volvo has also been exploring the idea of digital keys using a smartphone app but enabling short-term, non-owner vehicle use.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Toyota will create a Mobility Services Platform (MSPF) that will collaborate with various service providers and telematics insurance.

An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday, Feb. 23, 2023, to the manslaughter of an American Scott Johnson, who fell to his death 35 years ago from a Sydney cliff top that was known as a gay meeting place. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, File)\n\nCANBERRA - An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay meeting place, with the victim's family welcoming the turning point in their long campaign for justice.\n\nScott White's admission in the New South Wales state Supreme Court came three months after he had his conviction on charges of murdering Scott Johnson overturned by an appeals court.\n\nThe family of Los Angeles-born Johnson had fought for years to overturn an initial finding that the 27-year-old mathematician had taken his own life in 1988.\n\nJohnson's Boston-based older brother, Steve Johnson, told reporters that the proceedings Thursday \"might be the most emotional moment yet.\" He watched the Sydney court hearing online from the United States.\n\nBreakthrough evidence came last October when police intercepted a prison phone call between White and a niece in which he confessed to striking his victim at the clifftop, Johnson said.\n\n\"In that phone call to the niece, he corroborated evidence that they (police) had previously gathered, and that brought his defense team to the table\" to negotiate a guilty plea, Johnson told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The police work that continued during the appeal and after the appeal to get that one last piece of evidence that brought him to the table ... so that we could negotiate this, I'm incredibly thankful,\" he said.\n\nJohnson said he has read the facts of the crime agreed between prosecutors and defense lawyers as part of a plea deal that will be presented to a judge when White returns to court on June 6 to be sentenced.\n\n\"Reading the black and white of his confession, in which he states that he threw the first punch, which I imagine was the only punch and my brother must have been very close to the cliff ... makes me pretty angry,\" Johnson said.\n\nA coroner ruled in 2017 that Scott Johnson \"fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence\" by unknown assailants who \"attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.\"\n\nThe coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some people were also robbed.\n\nIt was the third inquest into the tragedy following pressure from the family. A coroner had initially ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died.\n\nSteve Johnson described the police investigation since the third inquest as \"spectacular.\" But he said his brother's homicide could have been solved easily by police when he died.\n\n\"In fact, many of us believe that it was the police indifference to these killings and bashings of gay men back in the '80s that helped cause them. The perpetrators always knew they would not get into trouble,\" Johnson said.\n\nA New South Wales government inquiry began hearing evidence in November of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.\n\nViolence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, an HIV support group, ACON, told the inquiry.\n\nSteve Johnson, a wealthy entrepreneur, offered a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward in 2020 for information about his brother's death, matching a reward already offered by police.\n\nWhite, 52, was arrested in Sydney that year and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Johnson, who was an Australian National University Ph.D. student living in the capital, Canberra, when he died.\n\nPolice have suggested the reward led to the arrest, saying they expected it would be collected after White's conviction.\n\nWhite took his lawyers by surprise in January last year by pleading guilty to murder during a pretrial hearing.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, White signed a statement saying that he had been \"confused\" when he pleaded guilty, had not caused Johnson's death and wanted to plead not guilty.\n\nBut the judge recorded the guilty plea and White was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.\n\nIn sentencing White, the judge said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, which would have led to a longer prison term.\n\nIn November, three judges of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that White should have been allowed to reverse his guilty plea, quashing his conviction and sentence.\n\nWhite on Thursday pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White's lawyers to accept the plea.\n\nPolice Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family's long fight for justice.\n\n\"Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who've been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they've done over many, many years,\" Yeomans said.\n\nThe Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales will report on June 30.\nSummary: An Australian has pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney cliff that was nicknamed as a gay meeting place.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN --\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope just peered into a celestial Pandora's box to see what lies beyond a megacluster of galaxies.\n\nThe space observatory observed Pandora's Cluster, also known as Abell 2744, where three massive clusters of galaxies are merging.\n\nThe group of galaxy clusters acts as a magnifying glass for the objects behind it. Called gravitational lensing, this natural phenomenon created a deep-field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies. Deep-field observations are long exposures of regions of the sky that can show distant, difficult-to-see objects.\n\nWebb has already captured several deep-field views of the universe since it began scientific observations in July. Gravitational lensing is crucial for astronomers because it can uncover features of the early universe that are otherwise impossible to see.\n\nPrevious images of the central core of Pandora's Cluster came courtesy of the Hubble Space Telescope. Webb's latest observation of the cluster has revealed never-before-seen details in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nAstronomers in the UNCOVER program, or Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization, used Webb's unique Near-Infrared Camera for 30 hours to capture detailed long-exposure images. The latest photo released Wednesday stitches together four of those images into a panorama that includes 50,000 sources of near-infrared light.\n\nHundreds of faint arced lines in the lower-right image are actually distant galaxies that scientists weren't able to spot with Hubble.\n\nThe many dots of light in the new Webb image represent galaxies. Gravitational lensing can distort the appearance of distant galaxies, making them appear different from the galaxies in the foreground of the image -- which is why the distant galaxies resemble arcs of light.\n\nNext, the research team will go through all of the data in the image and pinpoint galaxies that they'd like to study further this summer to gain new insights into the early universe.\nSummary: The James Webb Space Telescope obtained a new image of Pandora's Cluster, a megacluster of galaxies that allowed astronomers to peer into the distant universe and observe never-before-seen details.\nIs the summary consistent with the document? First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "Yes", "Response B": "Yes, the summary is consistent with the document.

Otherwise, they \"will no longer be able to access parliamentary infrastructure or internal digital services.\"\n\nPoilievre has been very active on social media platforms in the last year -- since he announced his intention to run for the party's leadership -- and uses them largely to speak directly to his base through his widely viewed and shared videos.\n\nPoilievre has now scrapped his TikTok account, where he had more than 236,000 followers, entirely. That's compared to his 279,000 YouTube subscribers, and 587,000 Twitter followers.\n\n\"Conservatives take seriously all threats to privacy and security from foreign authoritarian regimes and will always defend the individual privacy rights of Canadians,\" wrote Sebastian Skamski, a spokesperson for Poilievre's office, in an email to CTV News.\n\n\"The Leader and all Conservative caucus members will suspend their TikTok accounts and work with all parties to ensure our parliament is protected.\"\n\nSingh, meanwhile still has an active account on TikTok, with nearly 880,000 followers, and hasn't specified whether he'll leave the app entirely. He said Tuesday he will suspend his account, and that he has \"no concern at all about taking a step back from a social media platform when there are serious concerns.\"\n\nSingh joined TikTok shortly before the 2019 election, when no other party leaders were using the app. At the time, he used the platform to drum up support and encourage young voters.\n\nIn the nearly four years since, he's used the app both to discuss NDP priorities and to participate in viral trends, such as dance videos involving his family.\n\nSingh's TikTok following far surpasses the numbers on his other social media accounts; for example his 593,000 Twitter followers.\n\n\"I want to be able to reach out to people wherever they are, whether it's in a community centre or on a social media platform,\" Singh told reporters Tuesday. \"I really believe in using every tool I have to be able to get out to people and speak to them and hear from them and share my views.\"\n\nBut Singh will be suspending his account on both his personal and professional devices, and added: \"taking a pause to assess how we can do it safely is something that I feel very comfortable doing and I have no hesitation to do.\"\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau doesn't have an official account on TikTok, and said Monday, \"This may be a first step, it may be the only step we need to take, but every step of the way we're going to be making sure that we're keeping Canadians safe.\"\nSummary: Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has shut down his account on the social media app TikTok, while NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is \"taking a break\" from posting, following the news the federal government is banning the hugely popular app on government-issued phones.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The protest comes on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPhotos and videos of the demonstration showed activists in painter's coveralls lugging wheelbarrows full of paint sacs on Bayswater Road, near Hyde Park in Kensington.\n\nAs they uncorked the sacs and let the paint spill out, other protestors with large brooms spread the pigment across the busy intersection until it resembled the Ukrainian flag. Another organizer in a high-visibility jacket directed cars to drive slowly through the demonstration.\n\nA large group of spectators gathered to watch the protest as cars continued to pass through, picking up yellow and blue paint on their tires.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe group responsible for the stunt, Led by Donkeys, wrote in a statement: \"Tomorrow is the first anniversary of Putin's imperialist invasion of Ukraine, an independent state and a people with every right to self-determination. The existence of a massive Ukrainian flag outside his embassy in London will serve to remind him of that.\"\n\nSolidarity with Ukraine \n\n(Russian Embassy, London) pic.twitter.com/efRXKgDuqV -- Led By Donkeys (@ByDonkeys) February 23, 2023\n\nFour people, three men and one woman, were arrested in connection with the protest on suspicion of criminal damage and obstructing the highway, the Met Police confirmed to MyLondon. They are currently being detained at a West London police station.\n\nLed by Donkeys is an art activist group that formed to protest Brexit, but its focus has since grown to address other social issues. The name Led by Donkeys comes from the phrase 'lions led by donkeys,\" a saying from the First World War that referred to the belief that British soldiers were being led to their deaths by incompetent leaders.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe activists said they created the massive flag in front of the Russian embassy with 170 litres of yellow paint spread in the eastbound lane and a similar amount of blue paint in the westbound lane. They noted the paint was \"high-standard, non-toxic, solvent-free, eco-friendly, fast-dry edible paint designed for making road art.\"\n\nOne Londoner who drove through the protest shared a photo on Twitter of his blue-tinted wheels.\n\n\"Shame about my wheels,\" he wrote. \"Still, that protest put a huge smile on my face!\"\n\nHaha! It was so weird driving along going \"all those tyres are yellow. That's weird...\" then realising I was heading towards the blue... -- EviL Ras (@EviL_Ras) February 23, 2023\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, 2022. Just before the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to get off the war path, cautioning that an invasion would only bring \"an abundance of pain filth, blood and death\" to their doorsteps.\n\nOne year into the war, those words continue to ring true.\n\nThe numbers are dizzying: hundreds of thousands of Russian men have escaped abroad to avoid being thrown into battle; millions of Ukrainians have been uprooted from their homes; tens of billions of dollars have poured into weaponry that is making war ever more lethal; and trillions more dollars estimated have been lost for the global economy. And even those figures don't do justice to the human and economic costs.\n\nOf the body count -- surely the most important tally, but kept under wraps by both sides -- all that can be said with certainty is that it is horrific. Western officials estimate it to be in the many tens of thousands and growing inexorably.\n\nBut Ukraine still exists; that in itself is a stinging defeat for the Kremlin.\n\n-- With files from The Associated Press\nSummary: On the eve of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, U.K. activists dumped gallons of green and blue paint on the road in front of the London Russian embassy.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like pea milk, soon will be mandated to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has proposed new guidelines for the labeling and naming of PBMA products in response to their increased market availability and popularity among consumers.\nIs the summary consistent with the document? First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "The summary is not consistent with the document because it states that plant-based milk alternatives will be mandated to include a voluntary statement on their labels, but the document states that the proposal is only a draft guidance and is not yet mandatory.\nNo", "Response B": "The summary accurately and concisely captures the key points of the document. It highlights the recommendation in the guidelines for plant-based milk alternatives to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk.

The protest comes on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPhotos and videos of the demonstration showed activists in painter's coveralls lugging wheelbarrows full of paint sacs on Bayswater Road, near Hyde Park in Kensington.\n\nAs they uncorked the sacs and let the paint spill out, other protestors with large brooms spread the pigment across the busy intersection until it resembled the Ukrainian flag. Another organizer in a high-visibility jacket directed cars to drive slowly through the demonstration.\n\nA large group of spectators gathered to watch the protest as cars continued to pass through, picking up yellow and blue paint on their tires.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe group responsible for the stunt, Led by Donkeys, wrote in a statement: \"Tomorrow is the first anniversary of Putin's imperialist invasion of Ukraine, an independent state and a people with every right to self-determination.

They are currently being detained at a West London police station.\n\nLed by Donkeys is an art activist group that formed to protest Brexit, but its focus has since grown to address other social issues. The name Led by Donkeys comes from the phrase 'lions led by donkeys,\" a saying from the First World War that referred to the belief that British soldiers were being led to their deaths by incompetent leaders.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe activists said they created the massive flag in front of the Russian embassy with 170 litres of yellow paint spread in the eastbound lane and a similar amount of blue paint in the westbound lane.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN --\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope just peered into a celestial Pandora's box to see what lies beyond a megacluster of galaxies.\n\nThe space observatory observed Pandora's Cluster, also known as Abell 2744, where three massive clusters of galaxies are merging.\n\nThe group of galaxy clusters acts as a magnifying glass for the objects behind it. Called gravitational lensing, this natural phenomenon created a deep-field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies. Deep-field observations are long exposures of regions of the sky that can show distant, difficult-to-see objects.\n\nWebb has already captured several deep-field views of the universe since it began scientific observations in July. Gravitational lensing is crucial for astronomers because it can uncover features of the early universe that are otherwise impossible to see.\n\nPrevious images of the central core of Pandora's Cluster came courtesy of the Hubble Space Telescope. Webb's latest observation of the cluster has revealed never-before-seen details in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nAstronomers in the UNCOVER program, or Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization, used Webb's unique Near-Infrared Camera for 30 hours to capture detailed long-exposure images. The latest photo released Wednesday stitches together four of those images into a panorama that includes 50,000 sources of near-infrared light.\n\nHundreds of faint arced lines in the lower-right image are actually distant galaxies that scientists weren't able to spot with Hubble.\n\nThe many dots of light in the new Webb image represent galaxies. Gravitational lensing can distort the appearance of distant galaxies, making them appear different from the galaxies in the foreground of the image -- which is why the distant galaxies resemble arcs of light.\n\nNext, the research team will go through all of the data in the image and pinpoint galaxies that they'd like to study further this summer to gain new insights into the early universe.\nSummary: The James Webb Space Telescope obtained a new image of Pandora's Cluster, a megacluster of galaxies that allowed astronomers to peer into the distant universe and observe never-before-seen details.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Volvo believes it will sell about 750 examples of the Polestar-tuned V60 and S60 models this year, but it predicts the number will go up to about 1,500 in the medium-term future.\n\nAlthough Volvo hasn't revealed exactly how it plans on doubling sales, persistent rumors indicate that a sport-focused version of the Golf-sized V40 hatchback is on its way. Sources close to Volvo have previously hinted the V40 Polestar could benefit from a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that will use both a turbocharger and a supercharger to generate over 300 horsepower. An automatic transmission will send power to all four wheels via a Haldex-type all-wheel drive system, the same setup found in the Golf R.\n\nInterestingly, Volvo has confirmed that it has given Polestar immediate access to its gas-electric plug-in hybrid technology. Polestar will tweak both the gasoline-burning engine and the electric motor to squeeze as much power out of the drivetrain as possible while still keeping gas mileage in check.\n\nThe Gothenburg-based automaker has made it clear that it isn't interested in following Mercedes-AMG's lead and chasing all-out volume, but it wants to gradually expand the scope of its newly acquired Polestar sub-brand.\n\n\"Driving a Volvo Polestar is a special experience. We have decided to bring this experience to more Volvo drivers, placing the full resources of Volvo behind the development of Polestar as the model name for our high-performance cars,\" said Volvo boss H\u00e5kan Samuelsson in a statement.\n\nAlthough an official time frame for when the next Polestar-tuned Volvo will land was not provided, it's safe to assume it's not going to arrive until next year at the earliest. The V40 Polestar won't be sold in the United States, but subsequent models based on either the S60, the S90 (which will soon replace the S80) or the second-gen XC90 will undoubtedly join the company's lineup on our shores.\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The Volvo S60 Polestar has a 362-horsepower engine, and this week the Swedish automaker announced that it's taking full control of the Polestar sub-brand.

The sedan's 2.0-liter twin-charged four-cylinder engine delivers 362 horsepower and 347 pound-feet of torque, and it's paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.\n\nVolvo believes that the Polestar models will be able to compete with the BMW M3, Mercedes-AMG C63, and Audi RS4.\n\nThe Polestar version of the S60 can accelerate from 0-60 mph in 4.7 seconds and hit a top speed of 155 mph.\n\nThe Polestar S60 also features upgraded brakes, \u00d6hlins dampers, and a stiffer chassis.\n\nIn addition to the Polestar S60, the company will also introduce a Polestar-tuned V60 next year.\n\nThe S60 Polestar is the first of a series of Polestar Volvos that will be sold globally in the coming years.\n\nThe Polestar V60, which is the second-generation wagon from Volvo, will have the same engine and chassis as the Polestar S60.\n\nPolestar has already begun work on a high-performance plug-in hybrid version of the Volvo XC90 SUV, which is expected to arrive in the coming years.\n\nThe $500 million investment will help Polestar develop hybrid and electric technology for Volvo models, as well as expand the company's retail network.\n\nThe Polestar brand will be used to develop performance Volvos, and the first model to emerge from the partnership was the S60 Polestar.\n\nVolvo is the latest automaker to establish a performance sub-brand, following in the footsteps of Mercedes-AMG, Audi's RS division, and BMW's M division.\n\nThe Polestar S60 has a 362-horsepower engine, and Volvo believes it will be able to compete with the BMW M3, Mercedes-AMG C63, and Audi RS4.\n\nThe", "Response B": "Volvo has announced its purchased car tuner, Polestar, giving access to its gas-electric plug-in hybrid technology.

{"id": "546", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Given the document below, determine if the summary is factually consistent with the document. \nDocument: The labels of plant-based milk alternatives may soon include a voluntary statement conveying how their nutrient compositions compare with dairy milk.\n\nThat's the primary recommendation included in proposed guidelines, drafted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for the naming and labeling of PBMA products.\n\nThe draft guidance, released Wednesday, is a response to the increased market availability and consumption of plant-based milk alternatives over the last decade. The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like rice milk, soon will not be asked to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has proposed new guidelines for the labeling and naming of PBMA products in response to their increased market availability and unpopularity among consumers.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The summary accurately states that the FDA has proposed new guidelines for the labeling and naming of plant-based milk alternatives in response to their increased market availability and unpopularity among consumers.

Yes", "Response B": "The document does not mention rice milk specifically, and it also does not state that plant-based milk alternatives will be asked to include a voluntary statement on their labels. Rather, the document states that the FDA is proposing new guidelines to ensure that the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. The guidelines include a voluntary statement that may read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency. Additionally, the document mentions that PBMA products have a wide range of nutritional compositions and that their labels should make this clear, but it does not state that their labels will be required to include a statement comparing their nutritional value to dairy milk.

An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday, Feb. 23, 2023, to the manslaughter of an American Scott Johnson, who fell to his death 35 years ago from a Sydney cliff top that was known as a gay meeting place. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, File)\n\nCANBERRA - An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay meeting place, with the victim's family welcoming the turning point in their long campaign for justice.\n\nScott White's admission in the New South Wales state Supreme Court came three months after he had his conviction on charges of murdering Scott Johnson overturned by an appeals court.\n\nThe family of Los Angeles-born Johnson had fought for years to overturn an initial finding that the 27-year-old mathematician had taken his own life in 1988.\n\nJohnson's Boston-based older brother, Steve Johnson, told reporters that the proceedings Thursday \"might be the most emotional moment yet.\" He watched the Sydney court hearing online from the United States.\n\nBreakthrough evidence came last October when police intercepted a prison phone call between White and a niece in which he confessed to striking his victim at the clifftop, Johnson said.\n\n\"In that phone call to the niece, he corroborated evidence that they (police) had previously gathered, and that brought his defense team to the table\" to negotiate a guilty plea, Johnson told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The police work that continued during the appeal and after the appeal to get that one last piece of evidence that brought him to the table ... so that we could negotiate this, I'm incredibly thankful,\" he said.\n\nJohnson said he has read the facts of the crime agreed between prosecutors and defense lawyers as part of a plea deal that will be presented to a judge when White returns to court on June 6 to be sentenced.\n\n\"Reading the black and white of his confession, in which he states that he threw the first punch, which I imagine was the only punch and my brother must have been very close to the cliff ... makes me pretty angry,\" Johnson said.\n\nA coroner ruled in 2017 that Scott Johnson \"fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence\" by unknown assailants who \"attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.\"\n\nThe coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some people were also robbed.\n\nIt was the third inquest into the tragedy following pressure from the family. A coroner had initially ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died.\n\nSteve Johnson described the police investigation since the third inquest as \"spectacular.\" But he said his brother's homicide could have been solved easily by police when he died.\n\n\"In fact, many of us believe that it was the police indifference to these killings and bashings of gay men back in the '80s that helped cause them. The perpetrators always knew they would not get into trouble,\" Johnson said.\n\nA New South Wales government inquiry began hearing evidence in November of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.\n\nViolence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, an HIV support group, ACON, told the inquiry.\n\nSteve Johnson, a wealthy entrepreneur, offered a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward in 2020 for information about his brother's death, matching a reward already offered by police.\n\nWhite, 52, was arrested in Sydney that year and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Johnson, who was an Australian National University Ph.D. student living in the capital, Canberra, when he died.\n\nPolice have suggested the reward led to the arrest, saying they expected it would be collected after White's conviction.\n\nWhite took his lawyers by surprise in January last year by pleading guilty to murder during a pretrial hearing.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, White signed a statement saying that he had been \"confused\" when he pleaded guilty, had not caused Johnson's death and wanted to plead not guilty.\n\nBut the judge recorded the guilty plea and White was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.\n\nIn sentencing White, the judge said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, which would have led to a longer prison term.\n\nIn November, three judges of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that White should have been allowed to reverse his guilty plea, quashing his conviction and sentence.\n\nWhite on Thursday pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White's lawyers to accept the plea.\n\nPolice Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family's long fight for justice.\n\n\"Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who've been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they've done over many, many years,\" Yeomans said.\n\nThe Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales will report on June 30.\nSummary: An Australian has pleaded guilty to culpable homicide in the death of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay haunt.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Volvo believes it will sell about 750 examples of the Polestar-tuned V60 and S60 models this year, but it predicts the number will go up to about 1,500 in the medium-term future.\n\nAlthough Volvo hasn't revealed exactly how it plans on doubling sales, persistent rumors indicate that a sport-focused version of the Golf-sized V40 hatchback is on its way. Sources close to Volvo have previously hinted the V40 Polestar could benefit from a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that will use both a turbocharger and a supercharger to generate over 300 horsepower. An automatic transmission will send power to all four wheels via a Haldex-type all-wheel drive system, the same setup found in the Golf R.\n\nInterestingly, Volvo has confirmed that it has given Polestar immediate access to its gas-electric plug-in hybrid technology. Polestar will tweak both the gasoline-burning engine and the electric motor to squeeze as much power out of the drivetrain as possible while still keeping gas mileage in check.\n\nThe Gothenburg-based automaker has made it clear that it isn't interested in following Mercedes-AMG's lead and chasing all-out volume, but it wants to gradually expand the scope of its newly acquired Polestar sub-brand.\n\n\"Driving a Volvo Polestar is a special experience. We have decided to bring this experience to more Volvo drivers, placing the full resources of Volvo behind the development of Polestar as the model name for our high-performance cars,\" said Volvo boss H\u00e5kan Samuelsson in a statement.\n\nAlthough an official time frame for when the next Polestar-tuned Volvo will land was not provided, it's safe to assume it's not going to arrive until next year at the earliest. The V40 Polestar won't be sold in the United States, but subsequent models based on either the S60, the S90 (which will soon replace the S80) or the second-gen XC90 will undoubtedly join the company's lineup on our shores.\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The Volvo S60 Polestar has a 362-horsepower engine, and this week the Swedish automaker announced that it's taking full control of the Polestar sub-brand. The additional $500 million investment will be used to help Polestar further develop its hybrid and electric drivetrains, while also expanding its sales network.\n\nThe Polestar brand will be used to develop performance Volvos, and the first model to emerge from the partnership was the S60 Polestar. The sedan's 2.0-liter twin-charged four-cylinder engine delivers 362 horsepower and 347 pound-feet of torque, and it's paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.\n\nVolvo believes that the Polestar models will be able to compete with the BMW M3, Mercedes-AMG C63, and Audi RS4.\n\nThe Polestar version of the S60 can accelerate from 0-60 mph in 4.7 seconds and hit a top speed of 155 mph.\n\nThe Polestar S60 also features upgraded brakes, \u00d6hlins dampers, and a stiffer chassis.\n\nIn addition to the Polestar S60, the company will also introduce a Polestar-tuned V60 next year.\n\nThe S60 Polestar is the first of a series of Polestar Volvos that will be sold globally in the coming years.\n\nThe Polestar V60, which is the second-generation wagon from Volvo, will have the same engine and chassis as the Polestar S60.\n\nPolestar has already begun work on a high-performance plug-in hybrid version of the Volvo XC90 SUV, which is expected to arrive in the coming years.\n\nThe $500 million investment will help Polestar develop hybrid and electric technology for Volvo models, as well as expand the company's retail network.\n\nThe Polestar brand will be used to develop performance Volvos, and the first model to emerge from the partnership was the S60 Polestar.\n\nVolvo is the latest automaker to establish a performance sub-brand, following in the footsteps of Mercedes-AMG, Audi's RS division, and BMW's M division.\n\nThe Polestar S60 has a 362-horsepower engine, and Volvo believes it will be able to compete with the BMW M3, Mercedes-AMG C63, and Audi RS4.\n\nThe", "Response B": "Volvo will be expanding its high-performance Polestar sub-brand with the help of more performance-focused models and access to Volvo's plug-in hybrid technology.

Daugherty said the current approach of the Internet of Things around gadgetry may be good business now, but consumers have not developed a loyalty to the technologies.\n\n'Wearable consumer technologies have the highest abandonment rate of any consumer product category. That's because they're gadgets that people don't find sustainable value in,' he said. 'I'm generalizing, there are some that are good, but generally people abandon them at a rate of seven in 10 people within one year.'\n\nThe CTO pointed out that the churn around life cycles of small consumer gadgets profit businesses, 'but the customers aren't using them sustainably.'\n\nOther trends on which Accenture will focus are the 'outcome economy,' platform-driven businesses, intelligent enterprise, and the 'workforce reimagined,' he said.\n\n'There really needs to be a focus on the workforce and thinking about how the workforce works in different ways, and looking at both the policy and the corporate implications of how we can prepare the workforce to work in a new way. And a lot of this will be connected around how people interact with technology in a different way to work more effectively, work more safely,' Daugherty said.\n\nPUBLISHED JULY 13, 2015\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Paul Daugherty, CEO of Accenture, has told a group of executives at MIT that the current Internet of Things (IoT) approach has been \"misplaced\" and should be focused on creating better experiences for consumers.

The CEO also highlighted that businesses have been profitably using IoT devices for many years, but that consumers have not been willing to use them. Daugherty also pointed out that the IoT churn rate is \"high\", with a seven in ten device users abandoning it within a year.\n\nDaugherty instead argued that IoT should be viewed as an enabler, not a technology. The CEO pointed out that the IoT-enabled workforce will be more productive, efficient and safe. \"There really needs to be a focus on the workforce and thinking about how the workforce works in different ways, and looking at both the policy and the corporate implications of how we can prepare the workforce to work in a new way.

You're acting hurt and sad, but that's not how your character would act in this situation.\nCharles: But Jason and Laura had been together for 3 years. Don't you think his reaction would be one of both anger and sadness?\nAnna: At this point, no. I think he would react the way most guys would and then later on, we would see his real feelings.\nCharles: I'm not so sure about that.\nAnna: Let's try it my way and you can see how you feel when you're saying your lines. After that, if it still doesn't feel right we can try something else.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "Anna and Charles were discussing the scene they are working on, and Anna suggested that the character needs to show more anger and less sadness.

{"id": "520", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to improve media relations at an ad agency?", "Response A": "Of course.  I can\u2019t tell you exactly how to do it, since I don\u2019t have any experience with an ad agency.  But I can tell you a few things that may be relevant, based on my general knowledge of the world.  \n\nFirst, if you want to improve media relations at your agency, you might start by assessing how the current state of media relations is affecting the agency\u2019s bottom line.  For example, if the agency\u2019s reputation is suffering, or if the agency is having a hard time winning new business, that will probably be a good indicator that the media relations work needs to be improved.  \n\nSecond, you might think about why the media relations work is being done in the first place.  If the goal is to help the agency win new business, you\u2019ll want to make sure that your media relations work is helping with that.  If the goal is to help the agency improve its reputation, you\u2019ll want to make sure that the media relations work is having a positive effect on the agency\u2019s reputation.  \n\nThird, you might think about whether the current state of media relations is consistent with the agency\u2019s values.  For example, if the agency prides itself on being a cutting-edge, innovative place, it might be worth considering whether the current media relations work is helping the agency to achieve that goal.  \n\nFinally, you might want to think about how the media relations work is being done.  If the agency has a great reputation and is winning new business successfully, you might want to think about whether the current media relations work is being done effectively.  If the agency has a poor reputation and isn\u2019t winning new business successfully, you might want to think about whether the current media relations work is being done ineffectively.", "Response B": "Sure, here are some ideas for improving media relations at an ad agency:\n\n1.  Develop a strong media relations strategy: Create a clear and concise plan for how you will approach media relations, including your goals, target media outlets, and key messages.\n\n2.  Identify your key media contacts: Identify the key media contacts that you want to reach out to and build relationships with. This will help you to better understand the media landscape and how to best reach out to them.\n\n3.  Develop a strong message: Create a strong message that is clear, concise, and easily digestible for the media. This will help you to better communicate your key messages to the media.\n\n4.  Use a consistent tone and message: Use a consistent tone and message across all of your media outreach, so that your messages are easily recognized and understood by the media.\n\n5.  Follow up: Follow up with the media to ensure that they have received your message and that they are interested in covering your story.\n\n6.  Use social media: Use social media to reach out to the media and build relationships with them. This will help you to better understand the media landscape and how to best reach out to them.\n\n7.  Stay up-to-date on industry trends: Stay up-to-date on industry trends and news, so that you can better understand how to best reach out to the media.\n\nThese are just a few ideas for improving media relations at an ad agency.

No deaths have been reported.\n\nThe incidents have prompted public anger, with some Iranians accusing the government of negligence. Some parents have refused to let their children attend school.\n\nIn the latest incident, 15 schoolgirls were transferred to a hospital in Qom on February 22, the Qom News outlet reported, saying the students were in stable condition and under observation.\n\nThe first incident is believed to have occurred in November, when 18 schoolgirls in Qom were taken to a hospital after complaining of symptoms that included nausea, headaches, coughing, breathing difficulties, heart palpitations, and numbness and pain in their hands or legs.\n\nSince then, hundreds of students in Qom, mostly girls, have fallen ill with similar symptoms in a number of public schools, which are segregated by gender. Dozens have received treatment, while others have been hospitalized.\n\nAuthorities said they have not yet been able to determine the cause of the mysterious wave of sickness, despite conducting toxicology tests.\n\nMedical experts have not found any bacterial or viral infections in blood samples taken from sick students. The authorities have not yet dismissed the possibility that poisonous gas could have caused the illnesses, with some students reporting a strange smell in their classrooms.\n\nIran's chief prosecutor, Mohammad Javad Montazeri, suggested on February 21 that the incidents could be deliberate. In a letter to the state prosecutor in Qom, Montazeri said the \"worrying wave of some kind of poisoning\" in schools in the city indicate \"the possibility of intentional criminal actions.\"\n\nEarlier, Mojtaba Zolnour, a lawmaker from Qom, said the illnesses were \"abnormal\" and security officials were investigating. Another parliamentarian from Qom, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, suggested that fear and hysteria could have played a role.\n\nSome have speculated that religious extremists, in a bid to create fear and prevent girls from attending school, could be behind the incidents.\n\nLast week, Nafiseh Moradi, a researcher of Islamic studies at Al Zahra University, an all-female public university in Tehran, said in a commentary that it was suspicious that girls, not boys, were mainly affected by the illnesses. The article on Qom News was later removed.\n\nMany Iranians have accused the authorities of not doing enough to find the cause of the illnesses and prevent new cases. Some angry parents have refused to send their children to school.\n\n\"Of the 250 students in our school, only 50 attended classes,\" a teacher in Qom, who did not want to be named for fear of retribution, told RFE/RL's Radio Farda last week.\n\nA correspondent at the reformist Shargh daily who traveled to Qom reported this week that some schools in the city were \"unofficially\" closed.\n\nLast week, angry parents protested outside the governor's office and called for a transparent investigation. They also demanded that classes be held online, amid reports that the authorities were pressuring students to attend school.\n\nAn unnamed teacher at a girls' school in Qom told Shargh that they have been ordered to teach \"even if only one student\" was present in class. She also said students have been told not to share notes with classmates in an apparent bid to push more pupils to attend school in person.\n\nSome students who have fallen ill have complained of an \"unknown\" or \"unpleasant\" smell.\n\n\"My son recalled that for a moment there was the smell of rotten fish in the classroom,\" an unnamed woman whose son became sick was quoted as saying by the Tejarat News outlet. \"Then the school gave students face masks and told them to leave the classroom.\"\n\n\"Some of the children felt more ill than the others. Several of them were transferred to medical centers. My son was among them,\" the woman said, adding that her son had suffered from stomach pain.\n\nA student who fell ill in early February told Shargh that she spent three days in a hospital.\n\n\"I still feel some weakness in my legs after 20 days, and I have problems while moving my legs,\" the unnamed student said, adding that two of her friends were still in the hospital.\n\nSimilar waves of mysterious illnesses affecting schoolgirls have been reported in recent years in neighboring Afghanistan and in Central Asia. In many cases, the authorities were unable to find evidence of poison. Most of the incidents were blamed on mass panic and hysteria.\nSummary: Hundreds of girls have fallen sick in schools in Iran in the past few weeks, with some hospitalized.

{"id": "505", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Given the document below, determine if the summary is factually consistent with the document. \nDocument: The labels of plant-based milk alternatives may soon include a voluntary statement conveying how their nutrient compositions compare with dairy milk.\n\nThat's the primary recommendation included in proposed guidelines, drafted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for the naming and labeling of PBMA products.\n\nThe draft guidance, released Wednesday, is a response to the increased market availability and consumption of plant-based milk alternatives over the last decade. The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like rice milk, soon will not be asked to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has proposed new guidelines for the labeling and naming of PBMA products in response to their increased market availability and unpopularity among consumers.\nIs the summary consistent with the document? First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "The document does not mention rice milk specifically, and it also does not state that plant-based milk alternatives will be asked to include a voluntary statement on their labels. Rather, the document states that the FDA is proposing new guidelines to ensure that the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. The guidelines include a voluntary statement that may read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency. Additionally, the document mentions that PBMA products have a wide range of nutritional compositions and that their labels should make this clear, but it does not state that their labels will be required to include a statement comparing their nutritional value to dairy milk.

The protest comes on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPhotos and videos of the demonstration showed activists in painter's coveralls lugging wheelbarrows full of paint sacs on Bayswater Road, near Hyde Park in Kensington.\n\nAs they uncorked the sacs and let the paint spill out, other protestors with large brooms spread the pigment across the busy intersection until it resembled the Ukrainian flag. Another organizer in a high-visibility jacket directed cars to drive slowly through the demonstration.\n\nA large group of spectators gathered to watch the protest as cars continued to pass through, picking up yellow and blue paint on their tires.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe group responsible for the stunt, Led by Donkeys, wrote in a statement: \"Tomorrow is the first anniversary of Putin's imperialist invasion of Ukraine, an independent state and a people with every right to self-determination. The existence of a massive Ukrainian flag outside his embassy in London will serve to remind him of that.\"\n\nSolidarity with Ukraine \n\n(Russian Embassy, London) pic.twitter.com/efRXKgDuqV -- Led By Donkeys (@ByDonkeys) February 23, 2023\n\nFour people, three men and one woman, were arrested in connection with the protest on suspicion of criminal damage and obstructing the highway, the Met Police confirmed to MyLondon. They are currently being detained at a West London police station.\n\nLed by Donkeys is an art activist group that formed to protest Brexit, but its focus has since grown to address other social issues. The name Led by Donkeys comes from the phrase 'lions led by donkeys,\" a saying from the First World War that referred to the belief that British soldiers were being led to their deaths by incompetent leaders.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe activists said they created the massive flag in front of the Russian embassy with 170 litres of yellow paint spread in the eastbound lane and a similar amount of blue paint in the westbound lane. They noted the paint was \"high-standard, non-toxic, solvent-free, eco-friendly, fast-dry edible paint designed for making road art.\"\n\nOne Londoner who drove through the protest shared a photo on Twitter of his blue-tinted wheels.\n\n\"Shame about my wheels,\" he wrote. \"Still, that protest put a huge smile on my face!\"\n\nHaha! It was so weird driving along going \"all those tyres are yellow. That's weird...\" then realising I was heading towards the blue... -- EviL Ras (@EviL_Ras) February 23, 2023\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, 2022. Just before the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to get off the war path, cautioning that an invasion would only bring \"an abundance of pain filth, blood and death\" to their doorsteps.\n\nOne year into the war, those words continue to ring true.\n\nThe numbers are dizzying: hundreds of thousands of Russian men have escaped abroad to avoid being thrown into battle; millions of Ukrainians have been uprooted from their homes; tens of billions of dollars have poured into weaponry that is making war ever more lethal; and trillions more dollars estimated have been lost for the global economy. And even those figures don't do justice to the human and economic costs.\n\nOf the body count -- surely the most important tally, but kept under wraps by both sides -- all that can be said with certainty is that it is horrific. Western officials estimate it to be in the many tens of thousands and growing inexorably.\n\nBut Ukraine still exists; that in itself is a stinging defeat for the Kremlin.\n\n-- With files from The Associated Press\nSummary: On the eve of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, U.K. activists dumped gallons of green and purple paint in front of the London Russian embassy in support of their cause.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Volvo believes it will sell about 750 examples of the Polestar-tuned V60 and S60 models this year, but it predicts the number will go up to about 1,500 in the medium-term future.\n\nAlthough Volvo hasn't revealed exactly how it plans on doubling sales, persistent rumors indicate that a sport-focused version of the Golf-sized V40 hatchback is on its way. Sources close to Volvo have previously hinted the V40 Polestar could benefit from a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that will use both a turbocharger and a supercharger to generate over 300 horsepower. An automatic transmission will send power to all four wheels via a Haldex-type all-wheel drive system, the same setup found in the Golf R.\n\nInterestingly, Volvo has confirmed that it has given Polestar immediate access to its gas-electric plug-in hybrid technology. Polestar will tweak both the gasoline-burning engine and the electric motor to squeeze as much power out of the drivetrain as possible while still keeping gas mileage in check.\n\nThe Gothenburg-based automaker has made it clear that it isn't interested in following Mercedes-AMG's lead and chasing all-out volume, but it wants to gradually expand the scope of its newly acquired Polestar sub-brand.\n\n\"Driving a Volvo Polestar is a special experience. We have decided to bring this experience to more Volvo drivers, placing the full resources of Volvo behind the development of Polestar as the model name for our high-performance cars,\" said Volvo boss H\u00e5kan Samuelsson in a statement.\n\nAlthough an official time frame for when the next Polestar-tuned Volvo will land was not provided, it's safe to assume it's not going to arrive until next year at the earliest. The V40 Polestar won't be sold in the United States, but subsequent models based on either the S60, the S90 (which will soon replace the S80) or the second-gen XC90 will undoubtedly join the company's lineup on our shores.\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The Volvo S60 Polestar has a 362-horsepower engine, and this week the Swedish automaker announced that it's taking full control of the Polestar sub-brand.

The sedan's 2.0-liter twin-charged four-cylinder engine delivers 362 horsepower and 347 pound-feet of torque, and it's paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.\n\nVolvo believes that the Polestar models will be able to compete with the BMW M3, Mercedes-AMG C63, and Audi RS4.\n\nThe Polestar version of the S60 can accelerate from 0-60 mph in 4.7 seconds and hit a top speed of 155 mph.\n\nThe Polestar S60 also features upgraded brakes, \u00d6hlins dampers, and a stiffer chassis.\n\nIn addition to the Polestar S60, the company will also introduce a Polestar-tuned V60 next year.\n\nThe S60 Polestar is the first of a series of Polestar Volvos that will be sold globally in the coming years.\n\nThe Polestar V60, which is the second-generation wagon from Volvo, will have the same engine and chassis as the Polestar S60.\n\nPolestar has already begun work on a high-performance plug-in hybrid version of the Volvo XC90 SUV, which is expected to arrive in the coming years.\n\nThe $500 million investment will help Polestar develop hybrid and electric technology for Volvo models, as well as expand the company's retail network.\n\nThe Polestar brand will be used to develop performance Volvos, and the first model to emerge from the partnership was the S60 Polestar.\n\nVolvo is the latest automaker to establish a performance sub-brand, following in the footsteps of Mercedes-AMG, Audi's RS division, and BMW's M division.\n\nThe Polestar S60 has a 362-horsepower engine, and Volvo believes it will be able to compete with the BMW M3, Mercedes-AMG C63, and Audi RS4.\n\nThe", "Response B": "Volvo has announced that it has doubled the sales of Polestar-badged models in 2016, selling 1,200 Polestar models, with a predicted increase to 2,000 in 2017.

They've come to an alarming realization: Mussel shells are getting thinner and thinner.\n\nShells collected that are over 1,000 years old are on average 27 percent thicker than today's shells, the researchers note in new paper in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

Then, things suddenly started to get thin fast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe unsettling cause for the thinning shells is the rapidly acidifying waters of the Pacific Ocean.

An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday, Feb. 23, 2023, to the manslaughter of an American Scott Johnson, who fell to his death 35 years ago from a Sydney cliff top that was known as a gay meeting place. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, File)\n\nCANBERRA - An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay meeting place, with the victim's family welcoming the turning point in their long campaign for justice.\n\nScott White's admission in the New South Wales state Supreme Court came three months after he had his conviction on charges of murdering Scott Johnson overturned by an appeals court.\n\nThe family of Los Angeles-born Johnson had fought for years to overturn an initial finding that the 27-year-old mathematician had taken his own life in 1988.\n\nJohnson's Boston-based older brother, Steve Johnson, told reporters that the proceedings Thursday \"might be the most emotional moment yet.\" He watched the Sydney court hearing online from the United States.\n\nBreakthrough evidence came last October when police intercepted a prison phone call between White and a niece in which he confessed to striking his victim at the clifftop, Johnson said.\n\n\"In that phone call to the niece, he corroborated evidence that they (police) had previously gathered, and that brought his defense team to the table\" to negotiate a guilty plea, Johnson told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The police work that continued during the appeal and after the appeal to get that one last piece of evidence that brought him to the table ... so that we could negotiate this, I'm incredibly thankful,\" he said.\n\nJohnson said he has read the facts of the crime agreed between prosecutors and defense lawyers as part of a plea deal that will be presented to a judge when White returns to court on June 6 to be sentenced.\n\n\"Reading the black and white of his confession, in which he states that he threw the first punch, which I imagine was the only punch and my brother must have been very close to the cliff ... makes me pretty angry,\" Johnson said.\n\nA coroner ruled in 2017 that Scott Johnson \"fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence\" by unknown assailants who \"attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.\"\n\nThe coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some people were also robbed.\n\nIt was the third inquest into the tragedy following pressure from the family. A coroner had initially ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died.\n\nSteve Johnson described the police investigation since the third inquest as \"spectacular.\" But he said his brother's homicide could have been solved easily by police when he died.\n\n\"In fact, many of us believe that it was the police indifference to these killings and bashings of gay men back in the '80s that helped cause them. The perpetrators always knew they would not get into trouble,\" Johnson said.\n\nA New South Wales government inquiry began hearing evidence in November of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.\n\nViolence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, an HIV support group, ACON, told the inquiry.\n\nSteve Johnson, a wealthy entrepreneur, offered a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward in 2020 for information about his brother's death, matching a reward already offered by police.\n\nWhite, 52, was arrested in Sydney that year and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Johnson, who was an Australian National University Ph.D. student living in the capital, Canberra, when he died.\n\nPolice have suggested the reward led to the arrest, saying they expected it would be collected after White's conviction.\n\nWhite took his lawyers by surprise in January last year by pleading guilty to murder during a pretrial hearing.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, White signed a statement saying that he had been \"confused\" when he pleaded guilty, had not caused Johnson's death and wanted to plead not guilty.\n\nBut the judge recorded the guilty plea and White was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.\n\nIn sentencing White, the judge said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, which would have led to a longer prison term.\n\nIn November, three judges of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that White should have been allowed to reverse his guilty plea, quashing his conviction and sentence.\n\nWhite on Thursday pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White's lawyers to accept the plea.\n\nPolice Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family's long fight for justice.\n\n\"Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who've been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they've done over many, many years,\" Yeomans said.\n\nThe Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales will report on June 30.\nSummary: An Australian has pleaded guilty to culpable homicide in the death of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay haunt.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN --\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope just peered into a celestial Pandora's box to see what lies beyond a megacluster of galaxies.\n\nThe space observatory observed Pandora's Cluster, also known as Abell 2744, where three massive clusters of galaxies are merging.\n\nThe group of galaxy clusters acts as a magnifying glass for the objects behind it. Called gravitational lensing, this natural phenomenon created a deep-field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies. Deep-field observations are long exposures of regions of the sky that can show distant, difficult-to-see objects.\n\nWebb has already captured several deep-field views of the universe since it began scientific observations in July. Gravitational lensing is crucial for astronomers because it can uncover features of the early universe that are otherwise impossible to see.\n\nPrevious images of the central core of Pandora's Cluster came courtesy of the Hubble Space Telescope. Webb's latest observation of the cluster has revealed never-before-seen details in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nAstronomers in the UNCOVER program, or Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization, used Webb's unique Near-Infrared Camera for 30 hours to capture detailed long-exposure images. The latest photo released Wednesday stitches together four of those images into a panorama that includes 50,000 sources of near-infrared light.\n\nHundreds of faint arced lines in the lower-right image are actually distant galaxies that scientists weren't able to spot with Hubble.\n\nThe many dots of light in the new Webb image represent galaxies. Gravitational lensing can distort the appearance of distant galaxies, making them appear different from the galaxies in the foreground of the image -- which is why the distant galaxies resemble arcs of light.\n\nNext, the research team will go through all of the data in the image and pinpoint galaxies that they'd like to study further this summer to gain new insights into the early universe.\nSummary: The James Webb Space Telescope obtained a new image of Pandora's Cluster, a megacluster of galaxies that allowed astronomers to peer into the distant universe and observe never-before-seen details.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The MSPF will have \"various functions to support mobility services\" and \"leverage the Toyota Smart Center (TSC), the Toyota Big Data Center, and financial services\", according to a Toyota statement. The automaker will aggregate individual business functions it has created and offered to mobility service providers, including vehicle management systems and leasing programs. Toyota also announced that it has developed a Smart Key Box (SKB) for car-sharing users to lock and unlock doors or start the engine with their smartphone. The SKB is a physical unit to be placed in a car. The smartphone application receives codes from the SKB, which are authenticated with the device through Bluetooth low-energy communications for access to the vehicle. Toyota said that parameters for when the user can access the SKB are set and managed by TSC. Toyota's Mirai Creation Investment Limited Partnership has made a strategic investment (amount undisclosed) in car-sharing company Getaround. Toyota and Getaround will launch a pilot programme in January 2017 in San Francisco, California, United States. This will include a new financial product from Toyota Financial Services in which a lessee can use income from car-sharing to help generate his monthly lease payment. \"Based on the exploration results, Toyota will consider using the MSPF for other mobility services in Japan, like unmanned rent-a-car businesses,\" said the automaker.\n\nSignificance: Toyota seems to be playing a bit of catch-up in this mobility space, though it has invested in Uber. GM and Ford are among the companies that have already created mobility divisions and Audi recently announced a car-sharing trial. Ford's Peer-2-Peer experiment, announced in June 2015, leveraged Ford Credit for a similar program relative to offsetting lease payments with car-sharing income. In the United States, Ford's project used Getaround software. While many existing automakers offer smartphone apps that enable the car to be turned off or on or locked or unlocked from a phone, those apps are designed for owners and would be unable to react if a vehicle were kept too long or to other potential issues.

An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday, Feb. 23, 2023, to the manslaughter of an American Scott Johnson, who fell to his death 35 years ago from a Sydney cliff top that was known as a gay meeting place. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, File)\n\nCANBERRA - An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay meeting place, with the victim's family welcoming the turning point in their long campaign for justice.\n\nScott White's admission in the New South Wales state Supreme Court came three months after he had his conviction on charges of murdering Scott Johnson overturned by an appeals court.\n\nThe family of Los Angeles-born Johnson had fought for years to overturn an initial finding that the 27-year-old mathematician had taken his own life in 1988.\n\nJohnson's Boston-based older brother, Steve Johnson, told reporters that the proceedings Thursday \"might be the most emotional moment yet.\" He watched the Sydney court hearing online from the United States.\n\nBreakthrough evidence came last October when police intercepted a prison phone call between White and a niece in which he confessed to striking his victim at the clifftop, Johnson said.\n\n\"In that phone call to the niece, he corroborated evidence that they (police) had previously gathered, and that brought his defense team to the table\" to negotiate a guilty plea, Johnson told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The police work that continued during the appeal and after the appeal to get that one last piece of evidence that brought him to the table ... so that we could negotiate this, I'm incredibly thankful,\" he said.\n\nJohnson said he has read the facts of the crime agreed between prosecutors and defense lawyers as part of a plea deal that will be presented to a judge when White returns to court on June 6 to be sentenced.\n\n\"Reading the black and white of his confession, in which he states that he threw the first punch, which I imagine was the only punch and my brother must have been very close to the cliff ... makes me pretty angry,\" Johnson said.\n\nA coroner ruled in 2017 that Scott Johnson \"fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence\" by unknown assailants who \"attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.\"\n\nThe coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some people were also robbed.\n\nIt was the third inquest into the tragedy following pressure from the family. A coroner had initially ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died.\n\nSteve Johnson described the police investigation since the third inquest as \"spectacular.\" But he said his brother's homicide could have been solved easily by police when he died.\n\n\"In fact, many of us believe that it was the police indifference to these killings and bashings of gay men back in the '80s that helped cause them. The perpetrators always knew they would not get into trouble,\" Johnson said.\n\nA New South Wales government inquiry began hearing evidence in November of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.\n\nViolence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, an HIV support group, ACON, told the inquiry.\n\nSteve Johnson, a wealthy entrepreneur, offered a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward in 2020 for information about his brother's death, matching a reward already offered by police.\n\nWhite, 52, was arrested in Sydney that year and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Johnson, who was an Australian National University Ph.D. student living in the capital, Canberra, when he died.\n\nPolice have suggested the reward led to the arrest, saying they expected it would be collected after White's conviction.\n\nWhite took his lawyers by surprise in January last year by pleading guilty to murder during a pretrial hearing.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, White signed a statement saying that he had been \"confused\" when he pleaded guilty, had not caused Johnson's death and wanted to plead not guilty.\n\nBut the judge recorded the guilty plea and White was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.\n\nIn sentencing White, the judge said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, which would have led to a longer prison term.\n\nIn November, three judges of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that White should have been allowed to reverse his guilty plea, quashing his conviction and sentence.\n\nWhite on Thursday pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White's lawyers to accept the plea.\n\nPolice Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family's long fight for justice.\n\n\"Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who've been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they've done over many, many years,\" Yeomans said.\n\nThe Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales will report on June 30.\nSummary: An Australian has pleaded guilty to culpable homicide in the death of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay haunt.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

{"id": "43", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Announces collaboration with US car-sharing company\n\nToyota has announced it will create a Mobility Services Platform (MSPF), which will collaborate with various service providers and telematics insurance. The MSPF will have \"various functions to support mobility services\" and \"leverage the Toyota Smart Center (TSC), the Toyota Big Data Center, and financial services\", according to a Toyota statement. The automaker will aggregate individual business functions it has created and offered to mobility service providers, including vehicle management systems and leasing programs. Toyota also announced that it has developed a Smart Key Box (SKB) for car-sharing users to lock and unlock doors or start the engine with their smartphone. The SKB is a physical unit to be placed in a car. The smartphone application receives codes from the SKB, which are authenticated with the device through Bluetooth low-energy communications for access to the vehicle. Toyota said that parameters for when the user can access the SKB are set and managed by TSC. Toyota's Mirai Creation Investment Limited Partnership has made a strategic investment (amount undisclosed) in car-sharing company Getaround. Toyota and Getaround will launch a pilot programme in January 2017 in San Francisco, California, United States. This will include a new financial product from Toyota Financial Services in which a lessee can use income from car-sharing to help generate his monthly lease payment. \"Based on the exploration results, Toyota will consider using the MSPF for other mobility services in Japan, like unmanned rent-a-car businesses,\" said the automaker.\n\nSignificance: Toyota seems to be playing a bit of catch-up in this mobility space, though it has invested in Uber. GM and Ford are among the companies that have already created mobility divisions and Audi recently announced a car-sharing trial. Ford's Peer-2-Peer experiment, announced in June 2015, leveraged Ford Credit for a similar program relative to offsetting lease payments with car-sharing income. In the United States, Ford's project used Getaround software. While many existing automakers offer smartphone apps that enable the car to be turned off or on or locked or unlocked from a phone, those apps are designed for owners and would be unable to react if a vehicle were kept too long or to other potential issues.

He said Tuesday he will suspend his account, and that he has \"no concern at all about taking a step back from a social media platform when there are serious concerns.\"\n\nSingh joined TikTok shortly before the 2019 election, when no other party leaders were using the app. At the time, he used the platform to drum up support and encourage young voters.\n\nIn the nearly four years since, he's used the app both to discuss NDP priorities and to participate in viral trends, such as dance videos involving his family.\n\nSingh's TikTok following far surpasses the numbers on his other social media accounts; for example his 593,000 Twitter followers.\n\n\"I want to be able to reach out to people wherever they are, whether it's in a community centre or on a social media platform,\" Singh told reporters Tuesday. \"I really believe in using every tool I have to be able to get out to people and speak to them and hear from them and share my views.\"\n\nBut Singh will be suspending his account on both his personal and professional devices, and added: \"taking a pause to assess how we can do it safely is something that I feel very comfortable doing and I have no hesitation to do.\"\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau doesn't have an official account on TikTok, and said Monday, \"This may be a first step, it may be the only step we need to take, but every step of the way we're going to be making sure that we're keeping Canadians safe.\"\nSummary: Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has shut down his account on the social media app TikTok, while NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is \"taking a break\" from posting, following the news the federal government is banning the hugely popular app on government-issued phones.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

{"id": "425", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Given the document below, determine if the summary is factually consistent with the document. \nDocument: The labels of plant-based milk alternatives may soon include a voluntary statement conveying how their nutrient compositions compare with dairy milk.\n\nThat's the primary recommendation included in proposed guidelines, drafted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for the naming and labeling of PBMA products.\n\nThe draft guidance, released Wednesday, is a response to the increased market availability and consumption of plant-based milk alternatives over the last decade. The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like pea milk, soon will be mandated to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has proposed new guidelines for the labeling and naming of PBMA products in response to their increased market availability and popularity among consumers.\nIs the summary consistent with the document? First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "The summary is factually consistent with the document because it accurately reflects the primary recommendation of the FDA, which is that plant-based milk alternatives include a voluntary statement on their labels comparing their nutritional composition to dairy milk.\nNo", "Response B": "The summary accurately and concisely captures the key points of the document. It highlights the recommendation in the guidelines for plant-based milk alternatives to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk. It also notes that the FDA has proposed new guidelines in response to the increased market availability and popularity of PBMA products.

In the U.S. the app got banned in December for all federal government devices - due to concerns that the app may be spying. TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, is based in China. Also, TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew is expected to testify before the U.S. Congress on March 23 - the topic of discussion: potential risks that TikTok could be to U.S. national security.\n\nTikTok is in trouble. Or so it seems (the understatement of the year!). Across the U.S. and the European Union, the crazy-popular short video-sharing platform is facing scrutiny and mistrust. And now, Politico reports that European Commission staff is banned from using TikTok over security concerns.Allegedly, there are ties between Chinese tech companies and the Chinese Communist Party, and the West is getting alarmed. Also, people are getting more and more concerned with the possibility that TikTok collects info from all over the world.An unnamed official told the folks at Politico that EU staff was ordered to remove TikTok from their official devices and that the app should be removed from their personal devices as well if they happen to have work-related apps on said devices (or they can delete work-related apps from their personal devices and leave TikTok).EC employees received the information in an email sent on Thursday morning. Employees have until March 15 to remove the video-sharing app. After that deadline passes, devices with the app installed will be considered non-compliant, which was also underlined in the email.The European Union Council and Parliament are likely to follow with a similar ban, but it may take more time for the Parliament to implement such a policy.\nSummary: Employees of the European Commission are now forced to delete TikTok from their work devices, and there is no restriction on their personal devices even if they have work-related apps installed.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Watson, founder of the troubled digital start-up Ozy Media, was arrested Thursday, Feb. 23, 2023 on fraud charges as part of a scheme to prop up the financially struggling company, which hemorrhaged millions of dollars before it shut down amid revelations of possibly deceptive business practices. (Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File)\n\nNEW YORK - The founder of the troubled digital start-up Ozy Media was arrested Thursday on fraud charges as part of a scheme to prop up the financially struggling company, which hemorrhaged millions of dollars before it shut down amid revelations of possibly deceptive business practices.\n\nThe arrest of Carlos Watson at a Manhattan hotel came after two of the company's top executives pleaded guilty this month to fraud charges, including Ozy's then-chief operating officer, Samir Rao, who allegedly impersonated a YouTube executive during a pitch to Goldman Sachs, a potential investor.\n\nThe guilty pleas were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe indictment accuses Watson of conspiring to commit securities fraud and wire fraud, as well as identity theft for his role in the impersonation of several media executives.\n\n\"We are really disappointed,\" Watson's attorney, Lanny Breuer, told the Journal after the arrest. \"We have been acting in good faith and believe we had a constructive dialogue with the government and are shocked by the actions this morning.\"\n\nScrutiny over the company deepened after the New York Times reported in October 2021 that an Ozy official had masqueraded as a YouTube executive in a failing attempt to get Goldman Sachs to infuse money into the struggling enterprise.\n\nShortly after, Ozy said it was shutting down.\n\n\"As alleged, Carlos Watson is a con man whose business strategy was based on outright deceit and fraud,\" said Breon Peace, the U.S. Attorney for the Brooklyn-based Eastern District of New York. \"He ran Ozy as a criminal organization rather than as a reputable media company.\"\n\nMichael J. Driscoll, the assistant director-in-charge of the FBI's New York field office said Watson \"repeatedly attempted to entice both investors and lenders through a series of deliberate deceptions and fabrications.\"\n\nAuthorities say Watson and his business partners, between 2018 and 2021, attempted to defraud investors and lenders of \"tens of millions of dollars through fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions\" about the company's debts and other key financial information.\n\nOn multiple occasions, the U.S. attorney's office said, Watson and his colleagues pretended to be other media executives to cover up earlier misrepresentations.\nSummary: The founder of the troubled digital start-up Ozy Media was not arrested Thursday on fraud charges as part of a scheme to prop up the financially struggling company.\nIs the summary consistent with the document? First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "No. The summary states that Carlos Watson was arrested on fraud charges as part of a scheme to prop up the financially struggling company, which hemorrhaged millions of dollars before it shut down amid revelations of possibly deceptive business practices. However, the document states that Watson was arrested on fraud charges as part of a scheme to defraud investors and lenders of \"tens of millions of dollars through fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions\" about the company's debts and other key financial information. While the summary states that Watson was arrested due to allegations of fraudulent business practices, the document states that Watson was arrested due to allegations of fraudulent financial practices. Thus, the summary is factually inconsistent with the document.

In the U.S. the app got banned in December for all federal government devices - due to concerns that the app may be spying. TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, is based in China. Also, TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew is expected to testify before the U.S. Congress on March 23 - the topic of discussion: potential risks that TikTok could be to U.S. national security.\n\nTikTok is in trouble. Or so it seems (the understatement of the year!). Across the U.S. and the European Union, the crazy-popular short video-sharing platform is facing scrutiny and mistrust. And now, Politico reports that European Commission staff is banned from using TikTok over security concerns.Allegedly, there are ties between Chinese tech companies and the Chinese Communist Party, and the West is getting alarmed. Also, people are getting more and more concerned with the possibility that TikTok collects info from all over the world.An unnamed official told the folks at Politico that EU staff was ordered to remove TikTok from their official devices and that the app should be removed from their personal devices as well if they happen to have work-related apps on said devices (or they can delete work-related apps from their personal devices and leave TikTok).EC employees received the information in an email sent on Thursday morning. Employees have until March 15 to remove the video-sharing app. After that deadline passes, devices with the app installed will be considered non-compliant, which was also underlined in the email.The European Union Council and Parliament are likely to follow with a similar ban, but it may take more time for the Parliament to implement such a policy.\nSummary: Employees of the European Commission are now forced to delete TikTok from their work devices, and there is no restriction on their personal devices even if they have work-related apps installed.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

{"id": "367", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Given the document below, determine if the summary is factually consistent with the document. \nDocument: Hundreds of schoolgirls have fallen sick and scores have been hospitalized in Iran's holy city of Qom in recent months, with some parents and officials suspecting they were poisoned.\n\nBut the authorities, which have launched an investigation into the mysterious wave of illnesses, have not found any evidence of poison. No deaths have been reported.\n\nThe incidents have prompted public anger, with some Iranians accusing the government of negligence. Some parents have refused to let their children attend school.\n\nIn the latest incident, 15 schoolgirls were transferred to a hospital in Qom on February 22, the Qom News outlet reported, saying the students were in stable condition and under observation.\n\nThe first incident is believed to have occurred in November, when 18 schoolgirls in Qom were taken to a hospital after complaining of symptoms that included nausea, headaches, coughing, breathing difficulties, heart palpitations, and numbness and pain in their hands or legs.\n\nSince then, hundreds of students in Qom, mostly girls, have fallen ill with similar symptoms in a number of public schools, which are segregated by gender. Dozens have received treatment, while others have been hospitalized.\n\nAuthorities said they have not yet been able to determine the cause of the mysterious wave of sickness, despite conducting toxicology tests.\n\nMedical experts have not found any bacterial or viral infections in blood samples taken from sick students. The authorities have not yet dismissed the possibility that poisonous gas could have caused the illnesses, with some students reporting a strange smell in their classrooms.\n\nIran's chief prosecutor, Mohammad Javad Montazeri, suggested on February 21 that the incidents could be deliberate. In a letter to the state prosecutor in Qom, Montazeri said the \"worrying wave of some kind of poisoning\" in schools in the city indicate \"the possibility of intentional criminal actions.\"\n\nEarlier, Mojtaba Zolnour, a lawmaker from Qom, said the illnesses were \"abnormal\" and security officials were investigating. Another parliamentarian from Qom, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, suggested that fear and hysteria could have played a role.\n\nSome have speculated that religious extremists, in a bid to create fear and prevent girls from attending school, could be behind the incidents.\n\nLast week, Nafiseh Moradi, a researcher of Islamic studies at Al Zahra University, an all-female public university in Tehran, said in a commentary that it was suspicious that girls, not boys, were mainly affected by the illnesses. The article on Qom News was later removed.\n\nMany Iranians have accused the authorities of not doing enough to find the cause of the illnesses and prevent new cases. Some angry parents have refused to send their children to school.\n\n\"Of the 250 students in our school, only 50 attended classes,\" a teacher in Qom, who did not want to be named for fear of retribution, told RFE/RL's Radio Farda last week.\n\nA correspondent at the reformist Shargh daily who traveled to Qom reported this week that some schools in the city were \"unofficially\" closed.\n\nLast week, angry parents protested outside the governor's office and called for a transparent investigation. They also demanded that classes be held online, amid reports that the authorities were pressuring students to attend school.\n\nAn unnamed teacher at a girls' school in Qom told Shargh that they have been ordered to teach \"even if only one student\" was present in class.

They believed they held the raw materials to allow scientists to breed the super plants of the future, crops that could survive anything nature could throw at them.\n\nThe Institute's founder, Nikolai Vavilov, had spent years collecting rare and wild relatives of wheat, rye and other staples so crop breeders could mine their hardy genes. Now the Nazis had laid siege to Leningrad (now St Petersburg), preventing the institute's workers from leaving the city. So the botanists barricaded themselves in with the stash, preparing to defend it from rats, freezing weather and desperately hungry citizens.\n\nLesser scientists would have eaten the precious packs of rice, wheat, peas, oats and potatoes during the 28-month siege. Instead, Dmitri S Ivanov, the head of the rice collection, a bespectacled man with fine, side-parted hair, painstakingly conserved several thousand packs of rice while gradually succumbing to malnutrition.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "A new book reveals the story of a group of Russian botanists who faced a terrible choice during World War II: to eat the plants they had collected for the war effort, or to preserve them for the future.", "Response B": "Botanists are trying to find rare wild seed strains that can survive our climate change before they die out so as to ensure future global food supplies.

For centuries, farmers have been selecting crops that are productive, sweeter and easy to peel but at the same time sacrificing other traits, leaving us with a \"pampered offspring\" of plants; the search is on to recover the lost \"tough\" genes. Crops are increasingly vulnerable to being wiped out by a single disaster so an array of plant genes are needed to protect ourselves from future hunger."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 59}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5e459f61418f610891628564_64b662e49aaaa825d4a481b7", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 20s "}}

The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like pea milk, soon will be mandated to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has proposed new guidelines for the labeling and naming of PBMA products in response to their increased market availability and popularity among consumers.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

{"id": "343", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Given the document below, determine if the summary is factually consistent with the document. \nDocument: Hundreds of schoolgirls have fallen sick and scores have been hospitalized in Iran's holy city of Qom in recent months, with some parents and officials suspecting they were poisoned.\n\nBut the authorities, which have launched an investigation into the mysterious wave of illnesses, have not found any evidence of poison. No deaths have been reported.\n\nThe incidents have prompted public anger, with some Iranians accusing the government of negligence. Some parents have refused to let their children attend school.\n\nIn the latest incident, 15 schoolgirls were transferred to a hospital in Qom on February 22, the Qom News outlet reported, saying the students were in stable condition and under observation.\n\nThe first incident is believed to have occurred in November, when 18 schoolgirls in Qom were taken to a hospital after complaining of symptoms that included nausea, headaches, coughing, breathing difficulties, heart palpitations, and numbness and pain in their hands or legs.\n\nSince then, hundreds of students in Qom, mostly girls, have fallen ill with similar symptoms in a number of public schools, which are segregated by gender. Dozens have received treatment, while others have been hospitalized.\n\nAuthorities said they have not yet been able to determine the cause of the mysterious wave of sickness, despite conducting toxicology tests.\n\nMedical experts have not found any bacterial or viral infections in blood samples taken from sick students. The authorities have not yet dismissed the possibility that poisonous gas could have caused the illnesses, with some students reporting a strange smell in their classrooms.\n\nIran's chief prosecutor, Mohammad Javad Montazeri, suggested on February 21 that the incidents could be deliberate. In a letter to the state prosecutor in Qom, Montazeri said the \"worrying wave of some kind of poisoning\" in schools in the city indicate \"the possibility of intentional criminal actions.\"\n\nEarlier, Mojtaba Zolnour, a lawmaker from Qom, said the illnesses were \"abnormal\" and security officials were investigating. Another parliamentarian from Qom, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, suggested that fear and hysteria could have played a role.\n\nSome have speculated that religious extremists, in a bid to create fear and prevent girls from attending school, could be behind the incidents.\n\nLast week, Nafiseh Moradi, a researcher of Islamic studies at Al Zahra University, an all-female public university in Tehran, said in a commentary that it was suspicious that girls, not boys, were mainly affected by the illnesses. The article on Qom News was later removed.\n\nMany Iranians have accused the authorities of not doing enough to find the cause of the illnesses and prevent new cases. Some angry parents have refused to send their children to school.\n\n\"Of the 250 students in our school, only 50 attended classes,\" a teacher in Qom, who did not want to be named for fear of retribution, told RFE/RL's Radio Farda last week.\n\nA correspondent at the reformist Shargh daily who traveled to Qom reported this week that some schools in the city were \"unofficially\" closed.\n\nLast week, angry parents protested outside the governor's office and called for a transparent investigation. They also demanded that classes be held online, amid reports that the authorities were pressuring students to attend school.\n\nAn unnamed teacher at a girls' school in Qom told Shargh that they have been ordered to teach \"even if only one student\" was present in class. She also said students have been told not to share notes with classmates in an apparent bid to push more pupils to attend school in person.\n\nSome students who have fallen ill have complained of an \"unknown\" or \"unpleasant\" smell.\n\n\"My son recalled that for a moment there was the smell of rotten fish in the classroom,\" an unnamed woman whose son became sick was quoted as saying by the Tejarat News outlet. \"Then the school gave students face masks and told them to leave the classroom.\"\n\n\"Some of the children felt more ill than the others. Several of them were transferred to medical centers. My son was among them,\" the woman said, adding that her son had suffered from stomach pain.\n\nA student who fell ill in early February told Shargh that she spent three days in a hospital.\n\n\"I still feel some weakness in my legs after 20 days, and I have problems while moving my legs,\" the unnamed student said, adding that two of her friends were still in the hospital.\n\nSimilar waves of mysterious illnesses affecting schoolgirls have been reported in recent years in neighboring Afghanistan and in Central Asia. In many cases, the authorities were unable to find evidence of poison. Most of the incidents were blamed on mass panic and hysteria.\nSummary: Hundreds of girls have fallen sick in schools in Iran in the past few weeks, with some hospitalized.

In the U.S. the app got banned in December for all federal government devices - due to concerns that the app may be spying. TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, is based in China. Also, TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew is expected to testify before the U.S. Congress on March 23 - the topic of discussion: potential risks that TikTok could be to U.S. national security.\n\nTikTok is in trouble. Or so it seems (the understatement of the year!). Across the U.S. and the European Union, the crazy-popular short video-sharing platform is facing scrutiny and mistrust. And now, Politico reports that European Commission staff is banned from using TikTok over security concerns.Allegedly, there are ties between Chinese tech companies and the Chinese Communist Party, and the West is getting alarmed. Also, people are getting more and more concerned with the possibility that TikTok collects info from all over the world.An unnamed official told the folks at Politico that EU staff was ordered to remove TikTok from their official devices and that the app should be removed from their personal devices as well if they happen to have work-related apps on said devices (or they can delete work-related apps from their personal devices and leave TikTok).EC employees received the information in an email sent on Thursday morning. Employees have until March 15 to remove the video-sharing app. After that deadline passes, devices with the app installed will be considered non-compliant, which was also underlined in the email.The European Union Council and Parliament are likely to follow with a similar ban, but it may take more time for the Parliament to implement such a policy.\nSummary: Employees of the European Commission are now forced to delete TikTok from their work devices, and there is no restriction on their personal devices even if they have work-related apps installed.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN --\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope just peered into a celestial Pandora's box to see what lies beyond a megacluster of galaxies.\n\nThe space observatory observed Pandora's Cluster, also known as Abell 2744, where three massive clusters of galaxies are merging.\n\nThe group of galaxy clusters acts as a magnifying glass for the objects behind it. Called gravitational lensing, this natural phenomenon created a deep-field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies. Deep-field observations are long exposures of regions of the sky that can show distant, difficult-to-see objects.\n\nWebb has already captured several deep-field views of the universe since it began scientific observations in July. Gravitational lensing is crucial for astronomers because it can uncover features of the early universe that are otherwise impossible to see.\n\nPrevious images of the central core of Pandora's Cluster came courtesy of the Hubble Space Telescope. Webb's latest observation of the cluster has revealed never-before-seen details in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nAstronomers in the UNCOVER program, or Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization, used Webb's unique Near-Infrared Camera for 30 hours to capture detailed long-exposure images. The latest photo released Wednesday stitches together four of those images into a panorama that includes 50,000 sources of near-infrared light.\n\nHundreds of faint arced lines in the lower-right image are actually distant galaxies that scientists weren't able to spot with Hubble.\n\nThe many dots of light in the new Webb image represent galaxies. Gravitational lensing can distort the appearance of distant galaxies, making them appear different from the galaxies in the foreground of the image -- which is why the distant galaxies resemble arcs of light.\n\nNext, the research team will go through all of the data in the image and pinpoint galaxies that they'd like to study further this summer to gain new insights into the early universe.\nSummary: The James Webb Space Telescope obtained a new image of Pandora's Cluster, a megacluster of galaxies that allowed astronomers to peer into the distant universe and observe never-before-seen details.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The Hungary plant is the third such plant that Samsung SDI now has for the production of EV batteries, in addition to plants in Ulsan, South Korea and Xian, China.\n\nAccording to the company, the European market is set to lead in the global EV space due to its environment-friendly policy. Hence, the market for EV batteries in the region has been expanding at a faster pace.\n\nSpeaking at the opening of the new plant, Samsung SDI President Jun Young-hyun said \"For the first time, state-of-the-art technology of Samsung SDI will be applied to batteries to be made in this plant in Hungary. Batteries are one of the most important parts supplied to global car makers. I expect the plant to contribute much to the growth of the European electric vehicle market\".\n\nThe company had earlier used the Energy Storage Europe 2017 event to showcase its new line of energy storage systems (ESS) solutions. At the event, it highlighted the P3 \u2013 a high-powered model that has the capability to maintain high power for longer periods by using 78Ah high-power and high-energy density cells. These cells increase capacity by 15 percent without changing the size of 68Ah battery adopted for previous models. In January this year, the company had debuted its new battery that has the capacity to deliver driving range of up to 600 km and could fast charge an EV in 20 minutes with a driving range of 500 km.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Samsung is betting big on electric mobility and has just finished building its third factory for electric vehicle (EV) batteries.

{"id": "327", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Given the document below, determine if the summary is factually consistent with the document. \nDocument: The labels of plant-based milk alternatives may soon include a voluntary statement conveying how their nutrient compositions compare with dairy milk.\n\nThat's the primary recommendation included in proposed guidelines, drafted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for the naming and labeling of PBMA products.\n\nThe draft guidance, released Wednesday, is a response to the increased market availability and consumption of plant-based milk alternatives over the last decade. The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like pea milk, soon will be mandated to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has proposed new guidelines for the labeling and naming of PBMA products in response to their increased market availability and popularity among consumers.\nIs the summary consistent with the document? First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "The summary is not consistent with the document because it states that plant-based milk alternatives will be mandated to include a voluntary statement on their labels, but the document states that the proposal is only a draft guidance and is not yet mandatory.\nNo", "Response B": "The summary is factually consistent with the document because it accurately reflects the primary recommendation of the FDA, which is that plant-based milk alternatives include a voluntary statement on their labels comparing their nutritional composition to dairy milk.\nNo"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "factualnlg", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 47}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5f4fbc7fd2fd0a0ad265d45c_64b663777f4950b588f8be96", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "2"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 15s "}}

Daugherty said the current approach of the Internet of Things around gadgetry may be good business now, but consumers have not developed a loyalty to the technologies.\n\n'Wearable consumer technologies have the highest abandonment rate of any consumer product category.

So, when you borrow money, you\u2019re building up a credit history, which is a record of how you\u2019ve borrowed money in the past, and how you\u2019ve paid it back.  Credit history is important because it gives a sense of how responsible you are with money, and how likely you are to pay back any money you borrow in the future.  When you have a good credit history, you\u2019re a good credit risk, and banks and other lenders will be more likely to lend you money in the future.", "Response B": "There are several ways to maintain good credit. First, always pay your bills on time. This shows lenders that you are responsible and can be trusted. Second, keep your credit utilization low.

An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday, Feb. 23, 2023, to the manslaughter of an American Scott Johnson, who fell to his death 35 years ago from a Sydney cliff top that was known as a gay meeting place. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, File)\n\nCANBERRA - An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay meeting place, with the victim's family welcoming the turning point in their long campaign for justice.\n\nScott White's admission in the New South Wales state Supreme Court came three months after he had his conviction on charges of murdering Scott Johnson overturned by an appeals court.\n\nThe family of Los Angeles-born Johnson had fought for years to overturn an initial finding that the 27-year-old mathematician had taken his own life in 1988.\n\nJohnson's Boston-based older brother, Steve Johnson, told reporters that the proceedings Thursday \"might be the most emotional moment yet.\" He watched the Sydney court hearing online from the United States.\n\nBreakthrough evidence came last October when police intercepted a prison phone call between White and a niece in which he confessed to striking his victim at the clifftop, Johnson said.\n\n\"In that phone call to the niece, he corroborated evidence that they (police) had previously gathered, and that brought his defense team to the table\" to negotiate a guilty plea, Johnson told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The police work that continued during the appeal and after the appeal to get that one last piece of evidence that brought him to the table ... so that we could negotiate this, I'm incredibly thankful,\" he said.\n\nJohnson said he has read the facts of the crime agreed between prosecutors and defense lawyers as part of a plea deal that will be presented to a judge when White returns to court on June 6 to be sentenced.\n\n\"Reading the black and white of his confession, in which he states that he threw the first punch, which I imagine was the only punch and my brother must have been very close to the cliff ... makes me pretty angry,\" Johnson said.\n\nA coroner ruled in 2017 that Scott Johnson \"fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence\" by unknown assailants who \"attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.\"\n\nThe coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some people were also robbed.\n\nIt was the third inquest into the tragedy following pressure from the family. A coroner had initially ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died.\n\nSteve Johnson described the police investigation since the third inquest as \"spectacular.\" But he said his brother's homicide could have been solved easily by police when he died.\n\n\"In fact, many of us believe that it was the police indifference to these killings and bashings of gay men back in the '80s that helped cause them. The perpetrators always knew they would not get into trouble,\" Johnson said.\n\nA New South Wales government inquiry began hearing evidence in November of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.\n\nViolence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, an HIV support group, ACON, told the inquiry.\n\nSteve Johnson, a wealthy entrepreneur, offered a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward in 2020 for information about his brother's death, matching a reward already offered by police.\n\nWhite, 52, was arrested in Sydney that year and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Johnson, who was an Australian National University Ph.D. student living in the capital, Canberra, when he died.\n\nPolice have suggested the reward led to the arrest, saying they expected it would be collected after White's conviction.\n\nWhite took his lawyers by surprise in January last year by pleading guilty to murder during a pretrial hearing.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, White signed a statement saying that he had been \"confused\" when he pleaded guilty, had not caused Johnson's death and wanted to plead not guilty.\n\nBut the judge recorded the guilty plea and White was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.\n\nIn sentencing White, the judge said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, which would have led to a longer prison term.\n\nIn November, three judges of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that White should have been allowed to reverse his guilty plea, quashing his conviction and sentence.\n\nWhite on Thursday pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White's lawyers to accept the plea.\n\nPolice Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family's long fight for justice.\n\n\"Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who've been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they've done over many, many years,\" Yeomans said.\n\nThe Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales will report on June 30.\nSummary: An Australian has pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney cliff that was nicknamed as a gay meeting place.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like rice milk, soon will not be asked to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has proposed new guidelines for the labeling and naming of PBMA products in response to their increased market availability and unpopularity among consumers.\nIs the summary consistent with the document? First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "The summary is inconsistent with the document because it states that plant-based milk alternatives will not be asked to include a voluntary statement on their labels, which is not mentioned in the document. The document proposes that plant-based milk alternatives should include a voluntary statement on their labels.\nNo", "Response B": "The document does not mention rice milk specifically, and it also does not state that plant-based milk alternatives will be asked to include a voluntary statement on their labels.

The guidelines include a voluntary statement that may read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency. Additionally, the document mentions that PBMA products have a wide range of nutritional compositions and that their labels should make this clear, but it does not state that their labels will be required to include a statement comparing their nutritional value to dairy milk.

I can\u2019t tell you exactly how to do it, since I don\u2019t have any experience with an ad agency.  But I can tell you a few things that may be relevant, based on my general knowledge of the world.  \n\nFirst, if you want to improve media relations at your agency, you might start by assessing how the current state of media relations is affecting the agency\u2019s bottom line.  For example, if the agency\u2019s reputation is suffering, or if the agency is having a hard time winning new business, that will probably be a good indicator that the media relations work needs to be improved.  \n\nSecond, you might think about why the media relations work is being done in the first place.  If the goal is to help the agency win new business, you\u2019ll want to make sure that your media relations work is helping with that.  If the goal is to help the agency improve its reputation, you\u2019ll want to make sure that the media relations work is having a positive effect on the agency\u2019s reputation.  \n\nThird, you might think about whether the current state of media relations is consistent with the agency\u2019s values.  For example, if the agency prides itself on being a cutting-edge, innovative place, it might be worth considering whether the current media relations work is helping the agency to achieve that goal.  \n\nFinally, you might want to think about how the media relations work is being done.  If the agency has a great reputation and is winning new business successfully, you might want to think about whether the current media relations work is being done effectively.  If the agency has a poor reputation and isn\u2019t winning new business successfully, you might want to think about whether the current media relations work is being done ineffectively.", "Response B": "There are several ways to improve media relations at an ad agency. One way is to establish a good relationship with media contacts by sending them press releases, pitching story ideas, and keeping them updated on your agency's work. It's also important to be transparent and honest in your interactions with them. Another way is to provide valuable content that journalists can use in their stories, such as case studies or data-driven insights. You can also leverage social media to connect with journalists and share your agency's work with a wider audience. Finally, it's important to have a clear and consistent messaging strategy that aligns with your agency's mission and values, and to be responsive to media inquiries in a timely manner."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 49}, "label_annotations": {"email": "640ce3e5772a5a2776ccddb5_64b66494b10e71c4bd4b68ed", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "2", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 23s "}}

An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday, Feb. 23, 2023, to the manslaughter of an American Scott Johnson, who fell to his death 35 years ago from a Sydney cliff top that was known as a gay meeting place. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, File)\n\nCANBERRA - An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay meeting place, with the victim's family welcoming the turning point in their long campaign for justice.\n\nScott White's admission in the New South Wales state Supreme Court came three months after he had his conviction on charges of murdering Scott Johnson overturned by an appeals court.\n\nThe family of Los Angeles-born Johnson had fought for years to overturn an initial finding that the 27-year-old mathematician had taken his own life in 1988.\n\nJohnson's Boston-based older brother, Steve Johnson, told reporters that the proceedings Thursday \"might be the most emotional moment yet.\" He watched the Sydney court hearing online from the United States.\n\nBreakthrough evidence came last October when police intercepted a prison phone call between White and a niece in which he confessed to striking his victim at the clifftop, Johnson said.\n\n\"In that phone call to the niece, he corroborated evidence that they (police) had previously gathered, and that brought his defense team to the table\" to negotiate a guilty plea, Johnson told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The police work that continued during the appeal and after the appeal to get that one last piece of evidence that brought him to the table ... so that we could negotiate this, I'm incredibly thankful,\" he said.\n\nJohnson said he has read the facts of the crime agreed between prosecutors and defense lawyers as part of a plea deal that will be presented to a judge when White returns to court on June 6 to be sentenced.\n\n\"Reading the black and white of his confession, in which he states that he threw the first punch, which I imagine was the only punch and my brother must have been very close to the cliff ... makes me pretty angry,\" Johnson said.\n\nA coroner ruled in 2017 that Scott Johnson \"fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence\" by unknown assailants who \"attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.\"\n\nThe coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some people were also robbed.\n\nIt was the third inquest into the tragedy following pressure from the family. A coroner had initially ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died.\n\nSteve Johnson described the police investigation since the third inquest as \"spectacular.\" But he said his brother's homicide could have been solved easily by police when he died.\n\n\"In fact, many of us believe that it was the police indifference to these killings and bashings of gay men back in the '80s that helped cause them. The perpetrators always knew they would not get into trouble,\" Johnson said.\n\nA New South Wales government inquiry began hearing evidence in November of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.\n\nViolence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, an HIV support group, ACON, told the inquiry.\n\nSteve Johnson, a wealthy entrepreneur, offered a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward in 2020 for information about his brother's death, matching a reward already offered by police.\n\nWhite, 52, was arrested in Sydney that year and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Johnson, who was an Australian National University Ph.D. student living in the capital, Canberra, when he died.\n\nPolice have suggested the reward led to the arrest, saying they expected it would be collected after White's conviction.\n\nWhite took his lawyers by surprise in January last year by pleading guilty to murder during a pretrial hearing.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, White signed a statement saying that he had been \"confused\" when he pleaded guilty, had not caused Johnson's death and wanted to plead not guilty.\n\nBut the judge recorded the guilty plea and White was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.\n\nIn sentencing White, the judge said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, which would have led to a longer prison term.\n\nIn November, three judges of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that White should have been allowed to reverse his guilty plea, quashing his conviction and sentence.\n\nWhite on Thursday pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White's lawyers to accept the plea.\n\nPolice Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family's long fight for justice.\n\n\"Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who've been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they've done over many, many years,\" Yeomans said.\n\nThe Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales will report on June 30.\nSummary: An Australian has pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney cliff that was nicknamed as a gay meeting place.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Pack Your Teddy Bear in a Safe Place: Before leaving for your trip, make sure your teddy bear is packed in a safe place so it doesn't get lost or damaged during the journey. This could be in a small travel bag, a backpack or even in your carry-on luggage.\n\n2. Bring along Some Small Toys: To keep your teddy bear entertained during the trip, bring along some small toys or even some of their favorite snacks. This will help them feel more at home and make the journey more enjoyable.\n\n3. Don't Forget to Take Breaks: During long trips, it's important to take breaks and give your teddy bear some time to stretch their legs. Make sure to stop at rest stops or parks along the way so your bear can have some exercise and a change of scenery.\n\n4. Stay Comfortable: Depending on your mode of transportation, it's important to make sure your teddy bear is comfortable during the journey. This could mean bringing along a small blanket or pillow, or even just sitting with them to keep them company.\n\nOverall, taking your teddy bear on long trips can be a fun and rewarding experience.

Some companies may have restrictions or require additional paperwork.\n\n2. Consider the Type of Transportation: Depending on your budget and travel needs, consider the type of transportation that would be best for you and your teddy bear. For example, if you're traveling by car, you can bring along their favorite toys and snacks, and take breaks whenever needed. However, if you're traveling by plane or train, you'll need to follow specific guidelines and regulations, and may need to purchase a separate ticket for your bear.\n\n3.

And it's changing them in a pretty horrifying way.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Chicago has been comparing the shells of live mussels pulled from the Pacific coast today with historical shells, some of them thousands of years old. They've come to an alarming realization: Mussel shells are getting thinner and thinner.\n\nShells collected that are over 1,000 years old are on average 27 percent thicker than today's shells, the researchers note in new paper in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Thick shells were the norm until about the 1970s, when shells were 32 percent thicker than they are today. Then, things suddenly started to get thin fast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe unsettling cause for the thinning shells is the rapidly acidifying waters of the Pacific Ocean. Essentially, the mussels are in the process of a slow dissolve in the acid bath they now spend their lives stewing in.\n\nIf the thought of being slowly consumed from all around as you swim isn't quite horrifying enough, the researchers project that this is only the beginning of the bad news for yummy shellfish. With an ocean that's only growing more and more acidic, we could easily see mussels\u2014with their new brittle bodies\u2014die out.\n\nG/O Media may get a commission 10% off 10% off Wish A gift for literally everybody.\n\nGifts under $20, $10, and even $5.

Daugherty said the current approach of the Internet of Things around gadgetry may be good business now, but consumers have not developed a loyalty to the technologies.\n\n'Wearable consumer technologies have the highest abandonment rate of any consumer product category. That's because they're gadgets that people don't find sustainable value in,' he said. 'I'm generalizing, there are some that are good, but generally people abandon them at a rate of seven in 10 people within one year.'\n\nThe CTO pointed out that the churn around life cycles of small consumer gadgets profit businesses, 'but the customers aren't using them sustainably.'\n\nOther trends on which Accenture will focus are the 'outcome economy,' platform-driven businesses, intelligent enterprise, and the 'workforce reimagined,' he said.\n\n'There really needs to be a focus on the workforce and thinking about how the workforce works in different ways, and looking at both the policy and the corporate implications of how we can prepare the workforce to work in a new way. And a lot of this will be connected around how people interact with technology in a different way to work more effectively, work more safely,' Daugherty said.\n\nPUBLISHED JULY 13, 2015\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The current focus of IoT is misplaced on technology and gadget, and not where it should be - creating a better experience for consumers, according to the Chief Technology Officer of Accenture, Paul Daugherty.

He explained that wearables and other IoT devices are often viewed as \"gizmos that people don't find sustainable value in\". The CEO also highlighted that businesses have been profitably using IoT devices for many years, but that consumers have not been willing to use them. Daugherty also pointed out that the IoT churn rate is \"high\", with a seven in ten device users abandoning it within a year.\n\nDaugherty instead argued that IoT should be viewed as an enabler, not a technology. The CEO pointed out that the IoT-enabled workforce will be more productive, efficient and safe. \"There really needs to be a focus on the workforce and thinking about how the workforce works in different ways, and looking at both the policy and the corporate implications of how we can prepare the workforce to work in a new way. And a lot of this will be connected around how people interact with technology in a different way to work more effectively, work more safely,\" Daugherty said.\n\nThe CEO also highlighted that people are already working in a more digital way. \"We're not going to stop doing that,\" he said. \"We're going to do it in different ways.\"\n\nThe technology that is being used now, and will be used in the future, is the enabler, and the way that people work is the \"commodity\", according to Daugherty.

Volvo believes it will sell about 750 examples of the Polestar-tuned V60 and S60 models this year, but it predicts the number will go up to about 1,500 in the medium-term future.\n\nAlthough Volvo hasn't revealed exactly how it plans on doubling sales, persistent rumors indicate that a sport-focused version of the Golf-sized V40 hatchback is on its way. Sources close to Volvo have previously hinted the V40 Polestar could benefit from a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that will use both a turbocharger and a supercharger to generate over 300 horsepower. An automatic transmission will send power to all four wheels via a Haldex-type all-wheel drive system, the same setup found in the Golf R.\n\nInterestingly, Volvo has confirmed that it has given Polestar immediate access to its gas-electric plug-in hybrid technology. Polestar will tweak both the gasoline-burning engine and the electric motor to squeeze as much power out of the drivetrain as possible while still keeping gas mileage in check.\n\nThe Gothenburg-based automaker has made it clear that it isn't interested in following Mercedes-AMG's lead and chasing all-out volume, but it wants to gradually expand the scope of its newly acquired Polestar sub-brand.\n\n\"Driving a Volvo Polestar is a special experience. We have decided to bring this experience to more Volvo drivers, placing the full resources of Volvo behind the development of Polestar as the model name for our high-performance cars,\" said Volvo boss H\u00e5kan Samuelsson in a statement.\n\nAlthough an official time frame for when the next Polestar-tuned Volvo will land was not provided, it's safe to assume it's not going to arrive until next year at the earliest. The V40 Polestar won't be sold in the United States, but subsequent models based on either the S60, the S90 (which will soon replace the S80) or the second-gen XC90 will undoubtedly join the company's lineup on our shores.\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Volvo has announced its purchased car tuner, Polestar, giving access to its gas-electric plug-in hybrid technology.

Daugherty said the current approach of the Internet of Things around gadgetry may be good business now, but consumers have not developed a loyalty to the technologies.\n\n'Wearable consumer technologies have the highest abandonment rate of any consumer product category. That's because they're gadgets that people don't find sustainable value in,' he said. 'I'm generalizing, there are some that are good, but generally people abandon them at a rate of seven in 10 people within one year.'\n\nThe CTO pointed out that the churn around life cycles of small consumer gadgets profit businesses, 'but the customers aren't using them sustainably.'\n\nOther trends on which Accenture will focus are the 'outcome economy,' platform-driven businesses, intelligent enterprise, and the 'workforce reimagined,' he said.\n\n'There really needs to be a focus on the workforce and thinking about how the workforce works in different ways, and looking at both the policy and the corporate implications of how we can prepare the workforce to work in a new way. And a lot of this will be connected around how people interact with technology in a different way to work more effectively, work more safely,' Daugherty said.\n\nPUBLISHED JULY 13, 2015\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Paul Daugherty, CEO of Accenture, has told a group of executives at MIT that the current Internet of Things (IoT) approach has been \"misplaced\" and should be focused on creating better experiences for consumers. He explained that wearables and other IoT devices are often viewed as \"gizmos that people don't find sustainable value in\". The CEO also highlighted that businesses have been profitably using IoT devices for many years, but that consumers have not been willing to use them. Daugherty also pointed out that the IoT churn rate is \"high\", with a seven in ten device users abandoning it within a year.\n\nDaugherty instead argued that IoT should be viewed as an enabler, not a technology. The CEO pointed out that the IoT-enabled workforce will be more productive, efficient and safe. \"There really needs to be a focus on the workforce and thinking about how the workforce works in different ways, and looking at both the policy and the corporate implications of how we can prepare the workforce to work in a new way. And a lot of this will be connected around how people interact with technology in a different way to work more effectively, work more safely,\" Daugherty said.\n\nThe CEO also highlighted that people are already working in a more digital way. \"We're not going to stop doing that,\" he said. \"We're going to do it in different ways.\"\n\nThe technology that is being used now, and will be used in the future, is the enabler, and the way that people work is the \"commodity\", according to Daugherty. The CEO also highlighted that the IoT will be a force for good, by making people's lives more efficient and allowing them to work in new ways. \"It will be a force for good,\" he said. \"I think the IoT will be a force for good, but we're not there yet.\"", "Response B": "Accenture's CTO Paul Daugherty took the stage at a recent event at MIT to introduce the company's take on connected technologies: the \"Internet of Me.\" According to Daugherty, the current approach of the Internet of Things around gadgetry may be good business now, but consumers have not developed a loyalty to the technologies. Hence, Accenture suggests a new approach called the \"Internet of Me,\" which is focused on creating better experiences for consumers. The company also predicts other trends on which it will focus, including the 'outcome economy,' platform-driven businesses, intelligent enterprise, and the 'workforce reimagined.'"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 54}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5a56970b76d1c60001aaf2ab_64b6658a9647d62c0ed35171", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 58s "}}

They've come to an alarming realization: Mussel shells are getting thinner and thinner.\n\nShells collected that are over 1,000 years old are on average 27 percent thicker than today's shells, the researchers note in new paper in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

No deaths have been reported.\n\nThe incidents have prompted public anger, with some Iranians accusing the government of negligence. Some parents have refused to let their children attend school.\n\nIn the latest incident, 15 schoolgirls were transferred to a hospital in Qom on February 22, the Qom News outlet reported, saying the students were in stable condition and under observation.\n\nThe first incident is believed to have occurred in November, when 18 schoolgirls in Qom were taken to a hospital after complaining of symptoms that included nausea, headaches, coughing, breathing difficulties, heart palpitations, and numbness and pain in their hands or legs.\n\nSince then, hundreds of students in Qom, mostly girls, have fallen ill with similar symptoms in a number of public schools, which are segregated by gender. Dozens have received treatment, while others have been hospitalized.\n\nAuthorities said they have not yet been able to determine the cause of the mysterious wave of sickness, despite conducting toxicology tests.\n\nMedical experts have not found any bacterial or viral infections in blood samples taken from sick students. The authorities have not yet dismissed the possibility that poisonous gas could have caused the illnesses, with some students reporting a strange smell in their classrooms.\n\nIran's chief prosecutor, Mohammad Javad Montazeri, suggested on February 21 that the incidents could be deliberate. In a letter to the state prosecutor in Qom, Montazeri said the \"worrying wave of some kind of poisoning\" in schools in the city indicate \"the possibility of intentional criminal actions.\"\n\nEarlier, Mojtaba Zolnour, a lawmaker from Qom, said the illnesses were \"abnormal\" and security officials were investigating. Another parliamentarian from Qom, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, suggested that fear and hysteria could have played a role.\n\nSome have speculated that religious extremists, in a bid to create fear and prevent girls from attending school, could be behind the incidents.\n\nLast week, Nafiseh Moradi, a researcher of Islamic studies at Al Zahra University, an all-female public university in Tehran, said in a commentary that it was suspicious that girls, not boys, were mainly affected by the illnesses. The article on Qom News was later removed.\n\nMany Iranians have accused the authorities of not doing enough to find the cause of the illnesses and prevent new cases. Some angry parents have refused to send their children to school.\n\n\"Of the 250 students in our school, only 50 attended classes,\" a teacher in Qom, who did not want to be named for fear of retribution, told RFE/RL's Radio Farda last week.\n\nA correspondent at the reformist Shargh daily who traveled to Qom reported this week that some schools in the city were \"unofficially\" closed.\n\nLast week, angry parents protested outside the governor's office and called for a transparent investigation. They also demanded that classes be held online, amid reports that the authorities were pressuring students to attend school.\n\nAn unnamed teacher at a girls' school in Qom told Shargh that they have been ordered to teach \"even if only one student\" was present in class. She also said students have been told not to share notes with classmates in an apparent bid to push more pupils to attend school in person.\n\nSome students who have fallen ill have complained of an \"unknown\" or \"unpleasant\" smell.\n\n\"My son recalled that for a moment there was the smell of rotten fish in the classroom,\" an unnamed woman whose son became sick was quoted as saying by the Tejarat News outlet. \"Then the school gave students face masks and told them to leave the classroom.\"\n\n\"Some of the children felt more ill than the others. Several of them were transferred to medical centers. My son was among them,\" the woman said, adding that her son had suffered from stomach pain.\n\nA student who fell ill in early February told Shargh that she spent three days in a hospital.\n\n\"I still feel some weakness in my legs after 20 days, and I have problems while moving my legs,\" the unnamed student said, adding that two of her friends were still in the hospital.\n\nSimilar waves of mysterious illnesses affecting schoolgirls have been reported in recent years in neighboring Afghanistan and in Central Asia. In many cases, the authorities were unable to find evidence of poison. Most of the incidents were blamed on mass panic and hysteria.\nSummary: Hundreds of girls have fallen sick in schools in Iran in the past few weeks, with some hospitalized.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN --\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope just peered into a celestial Pandora's box to see what lies beyond a megacluster of galaxies.\n\nThe space observatory observed Pandora's Cluster, also known as Abell 2744, where three massive clusters of galaxies are merging.\n\nThe group of galaxy clusters acts as a magnifying glass for the objects behind it. Called gravitational lensing, this natural phenomenon created a deep-field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies. Deep-field observations are long exposures of regions of the sky that can show distant, difficult-to-see objects.\n\nWebb has already captured several deep-field views of the universe since it began scientific observations in July. Gravitational lensing is crucial for astronomers because it can uncover features of the early universe that are otherwise impossible to see.\n\nPrevious images of the central core of Pandora's Cluster came courtesy of the Hubble Space Telescope. Webb's latest observation of the cluster has revealed never-before-seen details in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nAstronomers in the UNCOVER program, or Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization, used Webb's unique Near-Infrared Camera for 30 hours to capture detailed long-exposure images. The latest photo released Wednesday stitches together four of those images into a panorama that includes 50,000 sources of near-infrared light.\n\nHundreds of faint arced lines in the lower-right image are actually distant galaxies that scientists weren't able to spot with Hubble.\n\nThe many dots of light in the new Webb image represent galaxies. Gravitational lensing can distort the appearance of distant galaxies, making them appear different from the galaxies in the foreground of the image -- which is why the distant galaxies resemble arcs of light.\n\nNext, the research team will go through all of the data in the image and pinpoint galaxies that they'd like to study further this summer to gain new insights into the early universe.\nSummary: The James Webb Space Telescope obtained a new image of Pandora's Cluster, a megacluster of galaxies that allowed astronomers to peer into the distant universe and observe never-before-seen details.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Otherwise, they \"will no longer be able to access parliamentary infrastructure or internal digital services.\"\n\nPoilievre has been very active on social media platforms in the last year -- since he announced his intention to run for the party's leadership -- and uses them largely to speak directly to his base through his widely viewed and shared videos.\n\nPoilievre has now scrapped his TikTok account, where he had more than 236,000 followers, entirely.

He said Tuesday he will suspend his account, and that he has \"no concern at all about taking a step back from a social media platform when there are serious concerns.\"\n\nSingh joined TikTok shortly before the 2019 election, when no other party leaders were using the app. At the time, he used the platform to drum up support and encourage young voters.\n\nIn the nearly four years since, he's used the app both to discuss NDP priorities and to participate in viral trends, such as dance videos involving his family.\n\nSingh's TikTok following far surpasses the numbers on his other social media accounts; for example his 593,000 Twitter followers.\n\n\"I want to be able to reach out to people wherever they are, whether it's in a community centre or on a social media platform,\" Singh told reporters Tuesday. \"I really believe in using every tool I have to be able to get out to people and speak to them and hear from them and share my views.\"\n\nBut Singh will be suspending his account on both his personal and professional devices, and added: \"taking a pause to assess how we can do it safely is something that I feel very comfortable doing and I have no hesitation to do.\"\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau doesn't have an official account on TikTok, and said Monday, \"This may be a first step, it may be the only step we need to take, but every step of the way we're going to be making sure that we're keeping Canadians safe.\"\nSummary: Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has shut down his account on the social media app TikTok, while NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is \"taking a break\" from posting, following the news the federal government is banning the hugely popular app on government-issued phones.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Employees have until March 15 to remove the video-sharing app. After that deadline passes, devices with the app installed will be considered non-compliant, which was also underlined in the email.The European Union Council and Parliament are likely to follow with a similar ban, but it may take more time for the Parliament to implement such a policy.\nSummary: Employees of the European Commission are now forced to delete TikTok from their work devices, and there is no restriction on their personal devices even if they have work-related apps installed.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday, Feb. 23, 2023, to the manslaughter of an American Scott Johnson, who fell to his death 35 years ago from a Sydney cliff top that was known as a gay meeting place. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, File)\n\nCANBERRA - An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay meeting place, with the victim's family welcoming the turning point in their long campaign for justice.\n\nScott White's admission in the New South Wales state Supreme Court came three months after he had his conviction on charges of murdering Scott Johnson overturned by an appeals court.\n\nThe family of Los Angeles-born Johnson had fought for years to overturn an initial finding that the 27-year-old mathematician had taken his own life in 1988.\n\nJohnson's Boston-based older brother, Steve Johnson, told reporters that the proceedings Thursday \"might be the most emotional moment yet.\" He watched the Sydney court hearing online from the United States.\n\nBreakthrough evidence came last October when police intercepted a prison phone call between White and a niece in which he confessed to striking his victim at the clifftop, Johnson said.\n\n\"In that phone call to the niece, he corroborated evidence that they (police) had previously gathered, and that brought his defense team to the table\" to negotiate a guilty plea, Johnson told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The police work that continued during the appeal and after the appeal to get that one last piece of evidence that brought him to the table ... so that we could negotiate this, I'm incredibly thankful,\" he said.\n\nJohnson said he has read the facts of the crime agreed between prosecutors and defense lawyers as part of a plea deal that will be presented to a judge when White returns to court on June 6 to be sentenced.\n\n\"Reading the black and white of his confession, in which he states that he threw the first punch, which I imagine was the only punch and my brother must have been very close to the cliff ... makes me pretty angry,\" Johnson said.\n\nA coroner ruled in 2017 that Scott Johnson \"fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence\" by unknown assailants who \"attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.\"\n\nThe coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some people were also robbed.\n\nIt was the third inquest into the tragedy following pressure from the family. A coroner had initially ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died.\n\nSteve Johnson described the police investigation since the third inquest as \"spectacular.\" But he said his brother's homicide could have been solved easily by police when he died.\n\n\"In fact, many of us believe that it was the police indifference to these killings and bashings of gay men back in the '80s that helped cause them. The perpetrators always knew they would not get into trouble,\" Johnson said.\n\nA New South Wales government inquiry began hearing evidence in November of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.\n\nViolence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, an HIV support group, ACON, told the inquiry.\n\nSteve Johnson, a wealthy entrepreneur, offered a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward in 2020 for information about his brother's death, matching a reward already offered by police.\n\nWhite, 52, was arrested in Sydney that year and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Johnson, who was an Australian National University Ph.D. student living in the capital, Canberra, when he died.\n\nPolice have suggested the reward led to the arrest, saying they expected it would be collected after White's conviction.\n\nWhite took his lawyers by surprise in January last year by pleading guilty to murder during a pretrial hearing.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, White signed a statement saying that he had been \"confused\" when he pleaded guilty, had not caused Johnson's death and wanted to plead not guilty.\n\nBut the judge recorded the guilty plea and White was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.\n\nIn sentencing White, the judge said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, which would have led to a longer prison term.\n\nIn November, three judges of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that White should have been allowed to reverse his guilty plea, quashing his conviction and sentence.\n\nWhite on Thursday pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White's lawyers to accept the plea.\n\nPolice Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family's long fight for justice.\n\n\"Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who've been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they've done over many, many years,\" Yeomans said.\n\nThe Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales will report on June 30.\nSummary: An Australian has pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney cliff that was nicknamed as a gay meeting place.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The plaintiffs in the case, which was styled Matera vs. Google, argued that this was a violation of both the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the California Information Privacy Act, calling the strategy \"the twenty-first-century equivalent of AT&amp;T eavesdropping on each of its customers' phone conversations, or of the postal service taking information from private correspondence.\"\n\nInstead of fight the case, Google agreed to change how it scans these emails \u2014 although scans for spam and malware would still occur during the delivery process as occurred before. The change will be seamless to customers, as it literally is a matter of milliseconds in processing time.\n\nIt's not clear whether Google was receiving any material benefit from the strategy \u2014 i.e. data from those non-Gmail users being used to serve more relevant ads across Google's widespread ad network. It also agreed to pay any legal costs related to the case and make a one-time payment of $2,000 to each of the class representatives.\n\nOther ad providers have not been so lucky. Yahoo was forced to settle over similar issues with its email-related ad-targeting practices, but ended up paying close to twice what Google had to in legal costs (about $4 million).\n\nGoogle declined to comment on the settlement, but offered that its efforts would result in concrete technical changes.

Some parents have refused to let their children attend school.\n\nIn the latest incident, 15 schoolgirls were transferred to a hospital in Qom on February 22, the Qom News outlet reported, saying the students were in stable condition and under observation.\n\nThe first incident is believed to have occurred in November, when 18 schoolgirls in Qom were taken to a hospital after complaining of symptoms that included nausea, headaches, coughing, breathing difficulties, heart palpitations, and numbness and pain in their hands or legs.\n\nSince then, hundreds of students in Qom, mostly girls, have fallen ill with similar symptoms in a number of public schools, which are segregated by gender. Dozens have received treatment, while others have been hospitalized.\n\nAuthorities said they have not yet been able to determine the cause of the mysterious wave of sickness, despite conducting toxicology tests.\n\nMedical experts have not found any bacterial or viral infections in blood samples taken from sick students. The authorities have not yet dismissed the possibility that poisonous gas could have caused the illnesses, with some students reporting a strange smell in their classrooms.\n\nIran's chief prosecutor, Mohammad Javad Montazeri, suggested on February 21 that the incidents could be deliberate. In a letter to the state prosecutor in Qom, Montazeri said the \"worrying wave of some kind of poisoning\" in schools in the city indicate \"the possibility of intentional criminal actions.\"\n\nEarlier, Mojtaba Zolnour, a lawmaker from Qom, said the illnesses were \"abnormal\" and security officials were investigating. Another parliamentarian from Qom, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, suggested that fear and hysteria could have played a role.\n\nSome have speculated that religious extremists, in a bid to create fear and prevent girls from attending school, could be behind the incidents.\n\nLast week, Nafiseh Moradi, a researcher of Islamic studies at Al Zahra University, an all-female public university in Tehran, said in a commentary that it was suspicious that girls, not boys, were mainly affected by the illnesses. The article on Qom News was later removed.\n\nMany Iranians have accused the authorities of not doing enough to find the cause of the illnesses and prevent new cases. Some angry parents have refused to send their children to school.\n\n\"Of the 250 students in our school, only 50 attended classes,\" a teacher in Qom, who did not want to be named for fear of retribution, told RFE/RL's Radio Farda last week.\n\nA correspondent at the reformist Shargh daily who traveled to Qom reported this week that some schools in the city were \"unofficially\" closed.\n\nLast week, angry parents protested outside the governor's office and called for a transparent investigation. They also demanded that classes be held online, amid reports that the authorities were pressuring students to attend school.\n\nAn unnamed teacher at a girls' school in Qom told Shargh that they have been ordered to teach \"even if only one student\" was present in class. She also said students have been told not to share notes with classmates in an apparent bid to push more pupils to attend school in person.\n\nSome students who have fallen ill have complained of an \"unknown\" or \"unpleasant\" smell.\n\n\"My son recalled that for a moment there was the smell of rotten fish in the classroom,\" an unnamed woman whose son became sick was quoted as saying by the Tejarat News outlet. \"Then the school gave students face masks and told them to leave the classroom.\"\n\n\"Some of the children felt more ill than the others. Several of them were transferred to medical centers. My son was among them,\" the woman said, adding that her son had suffered from stomach pain.\n\nA student who fell ill in early February told Shargh that she spent three days in a hospital.\n\n\"I still feel some weakness in my legs after 20 days, and I have problems while moving my legs,\" the unnamed student said, adding that two of her friends were still in the hospital.\n\nSimilar waves of mysterious illnesses affecting schoolgirls have been reported in recent years in neighboring Afghanistan and in Central Asia. In many cases, the authorities were unable to find evidence of poison. Most of the incidents were blamed on mass panic and hysteria.\nSummary: Hundreds of girls have fallen sick in schools in Iran in the past few weeks, with some hospitalized.
