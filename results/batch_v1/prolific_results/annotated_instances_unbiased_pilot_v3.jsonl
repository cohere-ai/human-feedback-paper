NASA/ESA/CSA/J. Lee of NOIRLab/A. Pagan of STScI\n\nIn visible light, the galaxies appeared dark and dim. But Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument was able to see the ways that stars and star clusters can shape galactic structure. The never-before-seen details captured in the Webb images show how these intricate networks within galaxies are influenced over time as stars form and evolve.\n\n\"We are directly seeing how the energy from the formation of young stars affects the gas around them, and it's just remarkable,\" said Erik Rosolowsky, a PHANGS team member and an associate professor of physics at the University of Alberta in Canada, in a statement.\n\nStars releasing energy created giant bubbles of gas and dust, or luminescent cavities, that gather around the spiral arms of the galaxies, and sometimes these bubblelike features overlap to form shells and a structure similar to a spiderweb.\n\n\"The PHANGS team has spent years observing these galaxies at optical, radio, and ultraviolent wavelengths using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and the Very Large Telescope's Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer,\" said Adam Leroy, a PHANGS team member and professor of astronomy at Ohio State University, in a statement.\n\nA Webb telescope image of NGC 1365 shows an intricate network of cavernous bubbles and shells as young stars release energy into the galaxy's spiral arms.

Overall, the summary is factually consistent with the document.", "Response B": "The summary is inconsistent with the article because the article does not mention anything about the \"surprising weblike structures\".

It's the first Starbucks Reserve Roastery -- the company's new retail offering -- outside the U.S.\n\nIt's also the largest Starbucks in the world, spanning an area nearly twice as large as the next biggest, a Roastery in Seattle that opened three years ago.\n\nExecutive Chairman Howard Schultz said the store would blend the company's 46-year history in the coffee shop business with \"China's rich, diverse culture.\"\n\nChina is a vital market for Starbucks (SBUX), according to John Gordon, a restaurant analyst at Pacific Management Consulting.\n\nThe company's latest quarterly earnings were pretty gloomy, showing disappointing sales growth in a tough retail environment.\n\nThe one bright spot was China, which stood out as Starbucks' fastest growing market. Sales there were up 8% compared with the same quarter last year.\n\nThe company is riding that wave and expanding aggressively in China, opening a new Starbucks store every 15 hours on average.\n\nRelated: China will get 2,000 more McDonald's restaurants in the next few years\n\nEven though Chinese are traditionally tea guzzlers and less hooked on coffee than Americans, the country's growing ranks of upwardly mobile consumers still view Starbucks as an attractive, aspirational brand.\n\nThe company is playing to that perception with its new Shanghai shop.\n\n\"This is a show store,\" Gordon said. \"The point is to be in a highly, highly visible, touristy [area] where there's foot traffic, offices and urban housing in order to promote the brand.\"\n\nRelated: Starbucks bets big on China\n\nThe store features massive copper casks for storing coffee beans, although the actual roasting will take place elsewhere on the premises. There is also a special emphasis on tea, with a dedicated bar offering items like nitrogen cold brew tea.\n\nIn a sign of the times, Starbucks partnered with Chinese tech giant Alibaba (BABA) to aggressively promote the Shanghai store opening online. Customers can book coffee tasting experiences on Alibaba's e-commerce site and also buy special Starbucks Reserve coffee and related products tied to the store's launch.\n\nBut the Shanghai roastery won't hold the title of largest Starbucks for too long.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN --\n\nAstronomers have used the James Webb Space Telescope to peer inside the heart of spiral galaxies, where young stars carve out glowing paths.\n\nThe space observatory can see the universe in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye, making the telescope uniquely poised to look through the dust that obscures some galactic features when less powerful telescopes are used.\n\nThe spiral arms of galaxy NGC 7496 are filled with bubbles and shells created by young stars releasing energy. NASA/ESA/CSA/J. Lee of NOIRLab/A. Pagan of STScI\n\nResearchers participating in the PHANGS collaboration, or Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby Galaxies, are using Webb's infrared capabilities to study 19 spiral galaxies.\n\nSo far, the telescope has observed five of them in detail, including galaxies M74, NGC 7496, IC 5332, NGC 1365 and NGC 1433.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope took this image of NGC 1433, a barred spiral galaxy with a bright core surrounded by double star-forming rings. NASA/ESA/CSA/J. Lee of NOIRLab/A. Pagan of STScI\n\nIn visible light, the galaxies appeared dark and dim. But Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument was able to see the ways that stars and star clusters can shape galactic structure. The never-before-seen details captured in the Webb images show how these intricate networks within galaxies are influenced over time as stars form and evolve.\n\n\"We are directly seeing how the energy from the formation of young stars affects the gas around them, and it's just remarkable,\" said Erik Rosolowsky, a PHANGS team member and an associate professor of physics at the University of Alberta in Canada, in a statement.\n\nStars releasing energy created giant bubbles of gas and dust, or luminescent cavities, that gather around the spiral arms of the galaxies, and sometimes these bubblelike features overlap to form shells and a structure similar to a spiderweb.\n\n\"The PHANGS team has spent years observing these galaxies at optical, radio, and ultraviolent wavelengths using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and the Very Large Telescope's Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer,\" said Adam Leroy, a PHANGS team member and professor of astronomy at Ohio State University, in a statement.\n\nA Webb telescope image of NGC 1365 shows an intricate network of cavernous bubbles and shells as young stars release energy into the galaxy's spiral arms.

It's the first Starbucks Reserve Roastery -- the company's new retail offering -- outside the U.S.\n\nIt's also the largest Starbucks in the world, spanning an area nearly twice as large as the next biggest, a Roastery in Seattle that opened three years ago.\n\nExecutive Chairman Howard Schultz said the store would blend the company's 46-year history in the coffee shop business with \"China's rich, diverse culture.\"\n\nChina is a vital market for Starbucks (SBUX), according to John Gordon, a restaurant analyst at Pacific Management Consulting.\n\nThe company's latest quarterly earnings were pretty gloomy, showing disappointing sales growth in a tough retail environment.\n\nThe one bright spot was China, which stood out as Starbucks' fastest growing market. Sales there were up 8% compared with the same quarter last year.\n\nThe company is riding that wave and expanding aggressively in China, opening a new Starbucks store every 15 hours on average.\n\nRelated: China will get 2,000 more McDonald's restaurants in the next few years\n\nEven though Chinese are traditionally tea guzzlers and less hooked on coffee than Americans, the country's growing ranks of upwardly mobile consumers still view Starbucks as an attractive, aspirational brand.\n\nThe company is playing to that perception with its new Shanghai shop.\n\n\"This is a show store,\" Gordon said. \"The point is to be in a highly, highly visible, touristy [area] where there's foot traffic, offices and urban housing in order to promote the brand.\"\n\nRelated: Starbucks bets big on China\n\nThe store features massive copper casks for storing coffee beans, although the actual roasting will take place elsewhere on the premises. There is also a special emphasis on tea, with a dedicated bar offering items like nitrogen cold brew tea.\n\nIn a sign of the times, Starbucks partnered with Chinese tech giant Alibaba (BABA) to aggressively promote the Shanghai store opening online. Customers can book coffee tasting experiences on Alibaba's e-commerce site and also buy special Starbucks Reserve coffee and related products tied to the store's launch.\n\nBut the Shanghai roastery won't hold the title of largest Starbucks for too long.

NASA/ESA/CSA/J. Lee of NOIRLab/A. Pagan of STScI\n\nResearchers participating in the PHANGS collaboration, or Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby Galaxies, are using Webb's infrared capabilities to study 19 spiral galaxies.\n\nSo far, the telescope has observed five of them in detail, including galaxies M74, NGC 7496, IC 5332, NGC 1365 and NGC 1433.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope took this image of NGC 1433, a barred spiral galaxy with a bright core surrounded by double star-forming rings. NASA/ESA/CSA/J. Lee of NOIRLab/A. Pagan of STScI\n\nIn visible light, the galaxies appeared dark and dim. But Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument was able to see the ways that stars and star clusters can shape galactic structure. The never-before-seen details captured in the Webb images show how these intricate networks within galaxies are influenced over time as stars form and evolve.\n\n\"We are directly seeing how the energy from the formation of young stars affects the gas around them, and it's just remarkable,\" said Erik Rosolowsky, a PHANGS team member and an associate professor of physics at the University of Alberta in Canada, in a statement.\n\nStars releasing energy created giant bubbles of gas and dust, or luminescent cavities, that gather around the spiral arms of the galaxies, and sometimes these bubblelike features overlap to form shells and a structure similar to a spiderweb.\n\n\"The PHANGS team has spent years observing these galaxies at optical, radio, and ultraviolent wavelengths using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and the Very Large Telescope's Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer,\" said Adam Leroy, a PHANGS team member and professor of astronomy at Ohio State University, in a statement.\n\nA Webb telescope image of NGC 1365 shows an intricate network of cavernous bubbles and shells as young stars release energy into the galaxy's spiral arms. NASA/ESA/CSA/J. Lee of NOIRLab/A. Pagan of STScI\n\n\"But, the earliest stages of a star's lifecycle have remained out of view because the process is enshrouded within gas and dust clouds.\"\n\nThe observation program will continue to focus on different galaxies, conduct a census of star formation, and unlock more insights about the life cycle of stars and how these stellar objects influence the galaxies they call home.\nSummary: Astronomers have used the James Webb Space Telescope to investigate inside the heart of spiral galaxies, where young stars carve out glowing paths, revealing the surprising weblike structures the stars create within galaxies as they evolve.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?
