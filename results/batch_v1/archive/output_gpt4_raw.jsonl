{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "Rumors surfaced earlier this month suggesting the Department of Justice was laying the foundation for an antitrust lawsuit to block AT&T's $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner. On Monday, the litigation came to fruition.\n\nThe development serves as a major blow to a deal that's been in the works for more than a year. Bloomberg first reported on the news earlier in the day.\n\nThe proposed merger was announced in October 2016. The goal, among other things, is to give AT&T more leverage in the rapidly changing entertainment landscape by allowing them to bundle mobile services with video products. Time Warner, as you may know, owns Turner Broadcasting System, Warner Bros and HBO, thus serving as a significant influencer in the production and broadcasting space.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the deal appeared to be headed toward approval as early as a month ago. That, however, was before new US antitrust Makan Delrahim came into power and took over the investigation. Delrahim apparently encouraged AT&T to sell its Turner broadcasting arm or DirecTV but the company declined.\n\nDelrahim said in a statement today that the merger would greatly harm American consumers, adding that it would mean higher monthly television bills and fewer of the new, emerging innovative options that consumers are beginning to enjoy.\n\nDavid R. McAtee II, Senior Executive Vice President and General Counsel, AT&T Inc., responded to the lawsuit:\n\n\"Today's DOJ lawsuit is a radical and inexplicable departure from decades of antitrust precedent. Vertical mergers like this one are routinely approved because they benefit consumers without removing any competitor from the market. We see no legitimate reason for our merger to be treated differently.\" \"Our merger combines Time Warner's content and talent with AT&T's TV, wireless and broadband distribution platforms.

On Monday, the litigation came to fruition.\n\nThe development serves as a major blow to a deal that's been in the works for more than a year. Bloomberg first reported on the news earlier in the day.\n\nThe proposed merger was announced in October 2016. The goal, among other things, is to give AT&T more leverage in the rapidly changing entertainment landscape by allowing them to bundle mobile services with video products. Time Warner, as you may know, owns Turner Broadcasting System, Warner Bros and HBO, thus serving as a significant influencer in the production and broadcasting space.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the deal appeared to be headed toward approval as early as a month ago. That, however, was before new US antitrust Makan Delrahim came into power and took over the investigation. Delrahim apparently encouraged AT&T to sell its Turner broadcasting arm or DirecTV but the company declined.\n\nDelrahim said in a statement today that the merger would greatly harm American consumers, adding that it would mean higher monthly television bills and fewer of the new, emerging innovative options that consumers are beginning to enjoy.\n\nDavid R. McAtee II, Senior Executive Vice President and General Counsel, AT&T Inc., responded to the lawsuit:\n\n\"Today's DOJ lawsuit is a radical and inexplicable departure from decades of antitrust precedent. Vertical mergers like this one are routinely approved because they benefit consumers without removing any competitor from the market. We see no legitimate reason for our merger to be treated differently.\" \"Our merger combines Time Warner's content and talent with AT&T's TV, wireless and broadband distribution platforms.

The finding highlights the need for earlier hospice admission or other strategies to address increasing symptoms and disability at the end of life, the researchers said.\n\nThe study was published on September 12 in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.\n\nThe researchers examined information from a study of 562 people, aged 70 and older, who were not disabled when the study began but died over the following 16 years.

The most common condition leading to death was frailty, followed by organ failure, advanced dementia, and cancer.\n\nThe study also found that the duration of hospice care was less than 13 days for half of the study participants.

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "In case you've been living under a rock, Snapchat is a free media messaging app where users can share images and short videos with their friends. It's become very popular with the younger generation, who seem to enjoy endless hours of puking rainbows and making themselves into slices of toast.\n\nIn 2016, media giant NBC decided to capitalize on this popularity by producing original content for some of its hit programs just for Snapchat users. With the vertical video layout of Snapchat, NBC didn't want to simply resuse video clips from programs. Instead, NBC decided to produce new content.\n\nPopular singing competition The Voice was one of the first featured on Snapchat. The series includes clips from the show's judges, as well as user-generated singing auditions. Prospective contestants can submit clips showcasing their talents at voicesnaps.com, where they will be reviewed by the show's judges, who will pick some of the hopefuls to perform in the upcoming season.\n\nBut in addition to adding new content for existing shows, NBC has also decided to launch programming that is entirely exclusive to Snapchat, like its show Stay Tuned. First debuted in July, the twice-daily headline news show features around four to five news stories focusing on the day's most important events. And thus far, it looks to be doing very, very well. According to NBCU, over 40 percent of Stay Tuned's viewers are watching at least three times a week, and the show already boasts 29 million unique viewers. As TechCrunch points out, that's about three times the number of viewers who watch NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt.\n\nAround 60 percent of the show's viewers are under the age of 25, which makes sense given Snapchat's generally youthful user base. And while it's still too soon to tell whether or not Stay Tuned is a sustainable success, early signs are quite positive.\n\nAll of this means Snapchat users are getting premiere access to mobile content from their favorite NBC programs, and some new ones, too. It also allows the network to reach millions of fans instantly right in the palm of their hand on an app they're already using. It's also a win for NBC's advertisers who are associated with this premium content and get to reach users in a new and dynamic way.

Here's a general outline of the process:\n\n1. Design the circuit: First, you need to design the circuit that you want to create on the PCB. You can use schematic capture software like KiCad, Altium Designer, or Eagle to draw the circuit and create a netlist that defines the connections between the components.\n\n2. Design the PCB layout: Using the netlist, you can now design the layout of the PCB. The layout determines the placement of the components, the routing of the conductive traces, and the size and shape of the board. PCB design software typically has tools for automatically placing and routing the components, but you can also do this manually if you prefer.\n\n3. Generate the manufacturing files: Once your PCB layout is complete, you'll need to generate the manufacturing files, which include Gerber files (or other file formats) for the copper layers, solder mask, and silkscreen, as well as a drill file for the holes in the board. These files will be used by the PCB manufacturer to create the physical board.\n\n4. Choose a PCB manufacturer: Find a PCB manufacturer that can produce your boards according to your specifications. There are many manufacturers available, both online and local, offering various levels of quality, price, and turnaround time. Be sure to provide them with the necessary manufacturing files when submitting your order.\n\n5. Assemble the board: Once you receive the manufactured PCBs, you'll need to assemble the components onto the board. This can be done manually by soldering the components in place or by using an automated assembly process like surface mount technology (SMT).\n\n6. Test the board: After assembling the board, you should test it to ensure that it functions correctly. This may involve visual inspection, continuity testing, and functional testing using test equipment like multimeters, oscilloscopes, or custom test jigs.\n\n7. Troubleshoot and iterate: If your PCB does not function as expected, you may need to troubleshoot the issues, revise your design, and go through the manufacturing process again.

Creationists often maintain a belief in a supernatural force or deity as the guiding influence in the development of life, whereas evolution relies on natural processes and scientific evidence.\n\n1. Origin of life: Evolution posits that life originated from simple organic compounds through a process called abiogenesis, eventually leading to the development of more complex life forms through billions of years. In contrast, intelligent design suggests that life was intentionally created by a higher power or an intelligent agent, often identified as God or a creator.\n\n2. Natural selection vs. purposeful design: Evolution is based on the principle of natural selection, which states that organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, these advantageous traits become more prevalent in the population, leading to the development of new species. Intelligent design, on the other hand, asserts that life forms are purposefully designed with specific features and functions by an intelligent creator.\n\n3. Random mutations: An essential component of evolutionary theory is the idea that genetic mutations occur randomly and can lead to new traits and features in organisms. Creationists who support intelligent design argue that such random mutations cannot account for the complexity and diversity of life on Earth. Instead, they propose that the intricate structures and functions found in living organisms are the result of deliberate design by an intelligent agent.\n\n4. Fossil record and geological evidence: Evolution is supported by extensive fossil records and geological evidence that indicate the gradual development of life forms over millions of years. Creationists who advocate for intelligent design may dispute the interpretation of these findings, arguing that the fossil record is incomplete or that the dating methods used by scientists are unreliable. They may also believe in a young Earth, suggesting that the planet is only several thousand years old, which contradicts the geological evidence supporting evolutionary theory.\n\n5. Irreducible complexity: Proponents of intelligent design often argue that certain biological structures and systems, such as the bacterial flagellum or the human eye, are too complex to have evolved through natural selection and random mutations. They claim that these structures are examples of \"irreducible complexity\" and can only be explained by the intervention of an intelligent designer. Evolutionary biologists, however, have provided explanations for the step-by-step development of these structures through natural processes.\n\nIn summary, the creationist perspective on evolution and intelligent design emphasizes the role of an intelligent agent or creator in the development of life on Earth, rejecting the natural processes and random"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}, "runtime": 59249.98876953125}}

The interplay of Yin and Yang is believed to govern all aspects of life, and harmony between these forces leads to a balanced and harmonious existence.\n\n3. Wu Wei: A core principle in Taoist philosophy is Wu Wei, or \"effortless action.\" This means aligning oneself with the natural flow of the Tao and acting spontaneously, without striving or forcing things. Wu Wei encourages individuals to let go of excessive desires and ambitions, and trust in the natural order of the universe.\n\n4. Self-cultivation: Taoism encourages individuals to seek harmony and balance within themselves, through practices such as meditation, martial arts, and traditional Chinese medicine. These practices are aimed at aligning the body, mind, and spirit with the Tao and promoting overall well-being.\n\n5. Connection with nature: Taoism places a strong emphasis on living in harmony with nature and the environment and teaches that human beings should respect and learn from the natural world around them.\n\n6. Religious aspects: Besides its philosophical dimensions, Taoism also encompasses religious practices, including rituals, prayers, and the worship of various deities. Taoist religious practices often involve seeking guidance and blessings from celestial beings, ancestors, and immortals.\n\n7. Texts and teachings: The foundational texts of Taoism are the Tao Te Ching, attributed to the sage Laozi, and the Zhuangzi, attributed to the philosopher Zhuangzi.

Use a toner: Apply a toner to your face using a cotton pad. This helps to tighten your pores and restore the pH balance of your skin.\n\n7. Apply a serum: Choose a serum that targets your specific skin concerns, such as acne, aging, or hydration. Gently massage the serum into your skin, allowing it to absorb completely.\n\n8. Moisturize: Finish your deep cleansing facial by applying a moisturizer suitable for your skin type. This will help to lock in hydration and nourishment, keeping your skin healthy and glowing.\n\n9. Optional: Use a jade roller or facial massage tool to help improve circulation and reduce puffiness. This can be done after applying the serum or moisturizer.\n\nRemember to perform a deep cleansing facial no more than once or twice a week to avoid over-exfoliating and irritating your skin."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}, "runtime": 77528.13305664062}}

It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific situation. Some ideas to consider include:\n\n1. Eat smaller meals more frequently: Instead of eating three large meals, try eating smaller meals every 2-3 hours. This can help prevent your stomach from becoming too full and reduce pressure on your lower esophagus.\n\n2. Avoid trigger foods: Some common trigger foods for acid reflux include spicy foods, fatty foods, citrus fruits, tomatoes, chocolate, and caffeine. Identify and avoid foods that seem to worsen your symptoms.\n\n3. Don't lie down after eating: Wait at least 2-3 hours after eating before lying down or going to bed. This allows your stomach time to digest the food and reduces the chances of reflux.\n\n4. Sleep with your head elevated: Use pillows or a wedge to prop up your head and upper body while you sleep. This can help prevent stomach acid from flowing back into your esophagus.\n\n5. Wear loose-fitting clothing: Tight clothing can put pressure on your abdomen, worsening acid reflux. Choose loose, comfortable clothing, especially around your waist and stomach.\n\n6. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day, but try to avoid drinking large amounts of liquid during meals, as this can increase the volume in your stomach and contribute to reflux.\n\n7. Chew gum: Chewing sugar-free gum after meals may help stimulate saliva production, which can help neutralize stomach acid.\n\n8.

First trimester (Week 1-13):\n- This stage begins from the first day of your last menstrual period and lasts until the end of week 13.\n- The fertilized egg implants itself into the wall of the uterus and starts to grow into an embryo.\n- Major organs and systems, such as the brain, heart, and spinal cord, begin to develop during this stage.\n- The embryo's heartbeat can be detected around week 6 to 8.\n- By week 12, the embryo becomes a fetus and is about two inches long.\n- Common symptoms during this trimester include morning sickness, fatigue, sore breasts, and frequent urination.\n\n2. Second trimester (Week 14-26):\n- This stage is often considered the most comfortable, as many early pregnancy symptoms subside.\n- The fetus continues to grow rapidly, and its organs and systems develop further.\n- By week 20, the fetus is about 6.5 inches long and weighs around 300 grams.\n- During this trimester, you may feel your baby move for the first time, usually between weeks 18 and 22.\n- Anatomical ultrasound scans are usually performed around week 20 to check for any abnormalities and determine the baby's sex.\n- Common symptoms during this trimester include backaches, leg cramps, and heartburn.\n\n3. Third trimester (Week 27-birth):\n- This stage lasts from week 27 until the baby is born, usually around week 40.\n- The fetus continues to grow and mature, gaining weight and developing its lungs and other organs.\n- By week 36, the fetus is usually in a head-down position, preparing for birth.\n- You may experience Braxton Hicks contractions, which are mild, irregular contractions that help prepare the uterus for labor.\n- As your due date approaches, you may experience more discomfort, such as difficulty sleeping, shortness of breath, and increased urination.\n- During this trimester, you will have more frequent prenatal visits, and your healthcare provider will monitor your baby's growth and position.\n- Labor usually begins between weeks 37 and 42, and it is marked by regular contractions, cervical dilation, and the eventual birth of the baby.\n\nIt's important to maintain regular prenatal care and communicate with"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}, "runtime": 65289.987060546875}}

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to sew a maternity skirt:\n\n1. Choose a fabric: Select a comfortable, stretchy fabric such as jersey, knit, or cotton with a bit of elastic. Choose a fabric that will be gentle on your skin and have enough stretch to accommodate your growing belly.\n\n2. Take measurements: Measure your waist, hips, and the desired length of the skirt. Add an extra 2 inches to the waist measurement, and 1 inch to the length for seam allowances.\n\n3. Create a pattern: On a large piece of paper, draw a rectangle with the dimensions of your waist measurement plus 2 inches, and the desired length of the skirt plus 1 inch. This will be the basic pattern for your skirt.\n\n4. Cut the fabric: Fold your fabric in half, with the right sides facing each other. Place the pattern on top of the fabric and pin it in place. Cut your fabric around the pattern, leaving a 1/2 inch seam allowance on all sides.\n\n5. Sew the side seams: With the right sides of the fabric still facing each other, pin the side seams together. Sew the side seams using a zigzag stitch or an overlock stitch, which will allow the fabric to stretch. Leave a 1/2 inch seam allowance.\n\n6. Create the waistband: Measure the width of your elastic waistband, and add 1 inch for seam allowances. Cut a rectangular piece of fabric with the same length as your waist measurement and the width calculated earlier. Fold the waistband fabric in half lengthwise, with the right sides facing each other, and sew the shorter ends together to create a loop.\n\n7. Attach the waistband to the skirt: With the right sides of the fabric facing each other, pin the waistband to the top edge of the skirt, aligning the side seams. Sew the waistband to the skirt using a zigzag stitch or an overlock stitch, leaving a 1/2 inch seam allowance.\n\n8.

Take a home pregnancy test: Home pregnancy tests detect the presence of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in your urine. These tests are usually accurate about a week after your missed period. If your periods are irregular, it might be helpful to wait for the longest cycle you usually have before taking a test.\n\n2.

Keep in mind that these symptoms can also be caused by other factors, so they're not definitive proof of pregnancy.\n\n3. Chart your basal body temperature (BBT): Tracking your BBT every day can help you identify your body's patterns and determine when you ovulate. A sustained increase in BBT after ovulation can be an early sign of pregnancy. This method requires consistency and might not be as reliable for individuals with irregular periods.\n\n4. Monitor cervical mucus changes: During ovulation, your cervical mucus typically becomes clear, slippery, and stretchy. Monitoring these changes can help you identify your fertile window.

Get news about destinations opening, inspiration for future adventures, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.\n\nCNN --\n\nFor years, journey times flying east from Israel depended on who you were flying with.\n\nIf you were boarding a flight operated by Israeli airlines, including national carrier El Al, your flight would take around two hours more than if you were flying with another airline.\n\nThe reason? Israeli airlines were banned from the airspace of both Oman and Saudi Arabia. That meant flights to India and Southeast Asia, which would naturally head east from Israel, had to dip south, crossing over Jordan and following the Red Sea down to the bottom of the Arabian Peninsula, before hooking northeast.\n\nNow, all that is set to change. Following the Saudi government's announcement in July 2022 that the country's airspace would open up to all carriers, Oman has followed suit.\n\nEl Al has posted a map of their current and new routes to Southeast Asia From El Al Israel\n\nOn February 23, the Civil Aviation Authority of Oman announced that it will open its airspace to \"all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflying\" - effectively ending the ban on El Al, Israir and Arkia, Israel's three airlines.\n\nIn a tweet, it said the move was \"part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfil its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, which stipulates non-discrimination between civil aircrafts used in international air navigation.\"\n\nThe move could cut Israeli carriers' flight times to Asia by up to three hours, Jonathan Sivarajah, an El Al frequent flier and Israeli aviation commentator, told CNN.\n\nAs part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfill its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, the Civil Aviation Authority affirms that the Sultanate's airspace is open for all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflyuing. pic.twitter.com/jNaqqDxZM1 -- hyy'@ lTWyrn lmdny (@CAAOMN) February 23, 2023\n\nHe added that it \"opens up further opportunities [for the airlines], not only to Asia but potentially to Australia, too.\"\n\nEl Al's nonstop flight from Tel Aviv to Bangkok is currently listed as taking 10 hours 45 minutes. But a nonstop flight on Royal Jordanian from Amman - 100 miles east of Tel Aviv - takes eight hours 10 minutes. In fact, flying Tel Aviv to Amman, and then on to Bangkok can be quicker, even including transfer time at the airport - a connecting flight can take as little as nine hours 55 minutes on Royal Jordanian.\n\nWhen the airline was banned from Saudi airspace, El Al flights from Tel Aviv to Mumbai took seven hours 45 minutes.

Israeli airlines were banned from the airspace of both Oman and Saudi Arabia. That meant flights to India and Southeast Asia, which would naturally head east from Israel, had to dip south, crossing over Jordan and following the Red Sea down to the bottom of the Arabian Peninsula, before hooking northeast.\n\nNow, all that is set to change. Following the Saudi government's announcement in July 2022 that the country's airspace would open up to all carriers, Oman has followed suit.\n\nEl Al has posted a map of their current and new routes to Southeast Asia From El Al Israel\n\nOn February 23, the Civil Aviation Authority of Oman announced that it will open its airspace to \"all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflying\" - effectively ending the ban on El Al, Israir and Arkia, Israel's three airlines.\n\nIn a tweet, it said the move was \"part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfil its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, which stipulates non-discrimination between civil aircrafts used in international air navigation.\"\n\nThe move could cut Israeli carriers' flight times to Asia by up to three hours, Jonathan Sivarajah, an El Al frequent flier and Israeli aviation commentator, told CNN.\n\nAs part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfill its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, the Civil Aviation Authority affirms that the Sultanate's airspace is open for all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflyuing. pic.twitter.com/jNaqqDxZM1 -- hyy'@ lTWyrn lmdny (@CAAOMN) February 23, 2023\n\nHe added that it \"opens up further opportunities [for the airlines], not only to Asia but potentially to Australia, too.\"\n\nEl Al's nonstop flight from Tel Aviv to Bangkok is currently listed as taking 10 hours 45 minutes. But a nonstop flight on Royal Jordanian from Amman - 100 miles east of Tel Aviv - takes eight hours 10 minutes. In fact, flying Tel Aviv to Amman, and then on to Bangkok can be quicker, even including transfer time at the airport - a connecting flight can take as little as nine hours 55 minutes on Royal Jordanian.\n\nWhen the airline was banned from Saudi airspace, El Al flights from Tel Aviv to Mumbai took seven hours 45 minutes. That flight time was then slashed to five hours 15 minutes, before the route was put on hold.\n\nAs the announcement was made, El Al swiftly posted a map of their old and new routes to Southeast Asia on Instagram.\n\nSivarajah said that until now, competing international carriers have \"flooded\" Israel with quicker flights than what the country's own airlines were able to provide.\n\n\"Tel Aviv-bound foreign carriers such as Air India could operate over territory which El Al couldn't.

Forbes claimed that the transfers were \"eerily similar\" to FTX's activities before its implosion.\n\nBinance transferred stablecoin collateral to Alameda Research\n\nAccording to on-chain data gathered by Forbes, the transfers started on 17 August last year.

Called gravitational lensing, this natural phenomenon created a deep-field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies. Deep-field observations are long exposures of regions of the sky that can show distant, difficult-to-see objects.\n\nWebb has already captured several deep-field views of the universe since it began scientific observations in July. Gravitational lensing is crucial for astronomers because it can uncover features of the early universe that are otherwise impossible to see.\n\nPrevious images of the central core of Pandora's Cluster came courtesy of the Hubble Space Telescope. Webb's latest observation of the cluster has revealed never-before-seen details in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nAstronomers in the UNCOVER program, or Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization, used Webb's unique Near-Infrared Camera for 30 hours to capture detailed long-exposure images. The latest photo released Wednesday stitches together four of those images into a panorama that includes 50,000 sources of near-infrared light.\n\nHundreds of faint arced lines in the lower-right image are actually distant galaxies that scientists weren't able to spot with Hubble.\n\nThe many dots of light in the new Webb image represent galaxies. Gravitational lensing can distort the appearance of distant galaxies, making them appear different from the galaxies in the foreground of the image -- which is why the distant galaxies resemble arcs of light.\n\nNext, the research team will go through all of the data in the image and pinpoint galaxies that they'd like to study further this summer to gain new insights into the early universe.\nSummary: The James Gunn Space Telescope captured a new image of Pandora's Cluster, a megacluster of galaxies that allowed astronomers to peer into the distant universe and observe never-before-seen details.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Webb's latest observation of the cluster has revealed never-before-seen details in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nAstronomers in the UNCOVER program, or Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization, used Webb's unique Near-Infrared Camera for 30 hours to capture detailed long-exposure images. The latest photo released Wednesday stitches together four of those images into a panorama that includes 50,000 sources of near-infrared light.\n\nHundreds of faint arced lines in the lower-right image are actually distant galaxies that scientists weren't able to spot with Hubble.\n\nThe many dots of light in the new Webb image represent galaxies. Gravitational lensing can distort the appearance of distant galaxies, making them appear different from the galaxies in the foreground of the image -- which is why the distant galaxies resemble arcs of light.\n\nNext, the research team will go through all of the data in the image and pinpoint galaxies that they'd like to study further this summer to gain new insights into the early universe.\nSummary: The James Gunn Space Telescope captured a new image of Pandora's Cluster, a megacluster of galaxies that allowed astronomers to peer into the distant universe and observe never-before-seen details.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

But the messenger RNA-focused biotech's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings also hint that the post-pandemic future that it has been building toward is taking shape as newer mRNA-based products inch closer to the market, particularly in infectious diseases like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and oncology.\n\nModerna announced its earnings on 23 February, reporting fourth quarter revenues of $5.1bn and full year revenues of $19.3bn, nearly all of which - $4.9bn and $18.4bn, respectively - came from global sales of Spikevax.\n\nBut the firm is keen to establish itself as a multi-product company. \"The company continues to expand at a rapid pace,\" CEO Stephane Bancel told Moderna's same-day earnings call. \"We now have three commercial COVID-19 vaccine products.

For the fourth quarter, the sales figure for Spikevax and related bivalent vaccines represented a 30% decrease from the comparable period in 2021, while for the full year it represented only a 4% increase. Profit for the fourth quarter was $1.5bn, and for the full year it was $8.4bn, representing decreases of 70% and 31%, respectively.\n\nFor the full year of 2023, Moderna expects Spikevax to have sales contracted for delivery of $5bn.\n\nModerna's experience is analogous to those of other companies that have relied on pandemic windfalls.

(Also see \"Gilead CAR-T Joins Billion-Dollar Club As Biktarvy Sales Cross $10bn Mark\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.)

(Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nRaimondo also reached out to semiconductor companies focused on chip design like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA) who had been worried about being left out of the government windfall as the bill was being negotiated.\n\n\"Our success will be short-lived\" if we focus only on manufacturing Raimondo said Thursday, adding that R&D is what will make it a longer term success.\n\n\"It's one thing to get companies here, we need them to stay here,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement to Yahoo Finance, Dario Gil, a senior vice president at IBM, congratulated the administration on the unveiling and added \"as a global leader in semiconductor research and development, IBM stands ready to work with our academic and manufacturing partners to implement new technologies and rapidly scale industrial innovation.\"\n\nThe new law has $39 billion earmarked for semiconductor manufacturers with an additional $11 billion to go to companies as well as universities and others for chip research and design purposes. In addition, the law includes an investment tax credit of up to 25 percent towards a manufacturer's capital expenditures.\n\nReturn on investment? National security.\n\nRaimondo compared the effort to President Lincoln's creation of the land-grant university system, nuclear security in the 1940s, and John F. Kennedy's famous call to put a man on the moon.\n\nShe noted that the 1960s saw an explosion of PhDs in the science and engineering fields to back up Kennedy's 1961 call--and she is hoping for something similar in the years ahead in universities and high schools to create a bigger semiconductor industry workforce.\n\nThe next step in the administration's plan will come next Tuesday when Raimondo's department unveils the formal application that manufacturing companies will need to access the money. \"It's going to be a very comprehensive application, which will be crystal clear about the specific criteria that we'll be looking for and the information we need from companies,\" Raimondo told reporters.\n\nThe speech also nodded to concerns that the billions, once they are signed over, could end going to things like stock buybacks. During her speech, Raimondo promised to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars and said she would will demand transparency from companies. A recent letter from prominent lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called on the administration to be vigilant on the buyback issue, saying it could undermine the national security goals of the program.\n\n\"I expect to be held accountable,\" Raimondo said.\n\nMeanwhile, the race for the money remains well underway with places like Arizona making a play to be one of the manufacturing hubs.\n\nRaimondo said she hopes the $50 billion in government funds will lead to somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 billion in private investment.\n\n\"Get in the boat, row with us to achieve this mission,\" she said during the speech in a comment directed towards private investors around the country. \"I don't want to spend a dime that I don't have to.\"\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or Android\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube\nSummary: The Biden administration is unveiling audacious goals Thursday for how it will seek to get the most bang for the billions it has at its disposal to spur the semiconductor sector in Spain in the years ahead.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Employees have until March 15 to remove the video-sharing app. After that deadline passes, devices with the app installed will be considered non-compliant, which was also underlined in the email.The European Union Council and Parliament are likely to follow with a similar ban, but it may take more time for the Parliament to implement such a policy.\nSummary: Employees of the European Commission are now forced to delete TikTok from their work devices, and there is no restriction on their personal devices even if they have work-related apps installed.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White's lawyers to accept the plea.\n\nPolice Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family's long fight for justice.\n\n\"Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who've been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they've done over many, many years,\" Yeomans said.\n\nThe Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales will report on June 30.\nSummary: An Australian has pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney cliff that was nicknamed as a gay meeting place.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The perpetrators always knew they would not get into trouble,\" Johnson said.\n\nA New South Wales government inquiry began hearing evidence in November of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.\n\nViolence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, an HIV support group, ACON, told the inquiry.\n\nSteve Johnson, a wealthy entrepreneur, offered a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward in 2020 for information about his brother's death, matching a reward already offered by police.\n\nWhite, 52, was arrested in Sydney that year and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Johnson, who was an Australian National University Ph.D. student living in the capital, Canberra, when he died.\n\nPolice have suggested the reward led to the arrest, saying they expected it would be collected after White's conviction.\n\nWhite took his lawyers by surprise in January last year by pleading guilty to murder during a pretrial hearing.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, White signed a statement saying that he had been \"confused\" when he pleaded guilty, had not caused Johnson's death and wanted to plead not guilty.\n\nBut the judge recorded the guilty plea and White was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.\n\nIn sentencing White, the judge said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, which would have led to a longer prison term.\n\nIn November, three judges of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that White should have been allowed to reverse his guilty plea, quashing his conviction and sentence.\n\nWhite on Thursday pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White's lawyers to accept the plea.\n\nPolice Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family's long fight for justice.\n\n\"Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who've been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they've done over many, many years,\" Yeomans said.\n\nThe Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales will report on June 30.\nSummary: An Australian has pleaded guilty to culpable homicide in the death of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay haunt.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

(Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File)\n\nNEW YORK - The founder of the troubled digital start-up Ozy Media was arrested Thursday on fraud charges as part of a scheme to prop up the financially struggling company, which hemorrhaged millions of dollars before it shut down amid revelations of possibly deceptive business practices.\n\nThe arrest of Carlos Watson at a Manhattan hotel came after two of the company's top executives pleaded guilty this month to fraud charges, including Ozy's then-chief operating officer, Samir Rao, who allegedly impersonated a YouTube executive during a pitch to Goldman Sachs, a potential investor.\n\nThe guilty pleas were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe indictment accuses Watson of conspiring to commit securities fraud and wire fraud, as well as identity theft for his role in the impersonation of several media executives.\n\n\"We are really disappointed,\" Watson's attorney, Lanny Breuer, told the Journal after the arrest. \"We have been acting in good faith and believe we had a constructive dialogue with the government and are shocked by the actions this morning.\"\n\nScrutiny over the company deepened after the New York Times reported in October 2021 that an Ozy official had masqueraded as a YouTube executive in a failing attempt to get Goldman Sachs to infuse money into the struggling enterprise.\n\nShortly after, Ozy said it was shutting down.\n\n\"As alleged, Carlos Watson is a con man whose business strategy was based on outright deceit and fraud,\" said Breon Peace, the U.S. Attorney for the Brooklyn-based Eastern District of New York. \"He ran Ozy as a criminal organization rather than as a reputable media company.\"\n\nMichael J. Driscoll, the assistant director-in-charge of the FBI's New York field office said Watson \"repeatedly attempted to entice both investors and lenders through a series of deliberate deceptions and fabrications.\"\n\nAuthorities say Watson and his business partners, between 2018 and 2021, attempted to defraud investors and lenders of \"tens of millions of dollars through fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions\" about the company's debts and other key financial information.\n\nOn multiple occasions, the U.S. attorney's office said, Watson and his colleagues pretended to be other media executives to cover up earlier misrepresentations.\nSummary: The founder of the distressed digital start-up Ozy Media has been apprehended on fraud charges as part of a scheme to sustain the financially struggling company.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Just before the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to get off the war path, cautioning that an invasion would only bring \"an abundance of pain filth, blood and death\" to their doorsteps.\n\nOne year into the war, those words continue to ring true.\n\nThe numbers are dizzying: hundreds of thousands of Russian men have escaped abroad to avoid being thrown into battle; millions of Ukrainians have been uprooted from their homes; tens of billions of dollars have poured into weaponry that is making war ever more lethal; and trillions more dollars estimated have been lost for the global economy. And even those figures don't do justice to the human and economic costs.\n\nOf the body count -- surely the most important tally, but kept under wraps by both sides -- all that can be said with certainty is that it is horrific. Western officials estimate it to be in the many tens of thousands and growing inexorably.\n\nBut Ukraine still exists; that in itself is a stinging defeat for the Kremlin.\n\n-- With files from The Associated Press\nSummary: On the night before the one-year anniversary of Russia's attack on Ukraine, U.K. activists dumped gallons of yellow and blue paint on the road in front of the London Russian embassy.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday, Feb. 23, 2023, to the manslaughter of an American Scott Johnson, who fell to his death 35 years ago from a Sydney cliff top that was known as a gay meeting place. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, File)\n\nCANBERRA - An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay meeting place, with the victim's family welcoming the turning point in their long campaign for justice.\n\nScott White's admission in the New South Wales state Supreme Court came three months after he had his conviction on charges of murdering Scott Johnson overturned by an appeals court.\n\nThe family of Los Angeles-born Johnson had fought for years to overturn an initial finding that the 27-year-old mathematician had taken his own life in 1988.\n\nJohnson's Boston-based older brother, Steve Johnson, told reporters that the proceedings Thursday \"might be the most emotional moment yet.\" He watched the Sydney court hearing online from the United States.\n\nBreakthrough evidence came last October when police intercepted a prison phone call between White and a niece in which he confessed to striking his victim at the clifftop, Johnson said.\n\n\"In that phone call to the niece, he corroborated evidence that they (police) had previously gathered, and that brought his defense team to the table\" to negotiate a guilty plea, Johnson told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The police work that continued during the appeal and after the appeal to get that one last piece of evidence that brought him to the table ... so that we could negotiate this, I'm incredibly thankful,\" he said.\n\nJohnson said he has read the facts of the crime agreed between prosecutors and defense lawyers as part of a plea deal that will be presented to a judge when White returns to court on June 6 to be sentenced.\n\n\"Reading the black and white of his confession, in which he states that he threw the first punch, which I imagine was the only punch and my brother must have been very close to the cliff ... makes me pretty angry,\" Johnson said.\n\nA coroner ruled in 2017 that Scott Johnson \"fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence\" by unknown assailants who \"attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.\"\n\nThe coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims.

Some people were also robbed.\n\nIt was the third inquest into the tragedy following pressure from the family.

Driscoll, the assistant director-in-charge of the FBI's New York field office said Watson \"repeatedly attempted to entice both investors and lenders through a series of deliberate deceptions and fabrications.\"\n\nAuthorities say Watson and his business partners, between 2018 and 2021, attempted to defraud investors and lenders of \"tens of millions of dollars through fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions\" about the company's debts and other key financial information.\n\nOn multiple occasions, the U.S. attorney's office said, Watson and his colleagues pretended to be other media executives to cover up earlier misrepresentations.\nSummary: The founder of the struggling digital start-up Ozy Media has been arrested on fraud charges as part of a scheme to prop up the financially unstable company.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The name Led by Donkeys comes from the phrase 'lions led by donkeys,\" a saying from the First World War that referred to the belief that British soldiers were being led to their deaths by incompetent leaders.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe activists said they created the massive flag in front of the Russian embassy with 170 litres of yellow paint spread in the eastbound lane and a similar amount of blue paint in the westbound lane. They noted the paint was \"high-standard, non-toxic, solvent-free, eco-friendly, fast-dry edible paint designed for making road art.\"\n\nOne Londoner who drove through the protest shared a photo on Twitter of his blue-tinted wheels.\n\n\"Shame about my wheels,\" he wrote. \"Still, that protest put a huge smile on my face!\"\n\nHaha! It was so weird driving along going \"all those tyres are yellow. That's weird...\" then realising I was heading towards the blue... -- EviL Ras (@EviL_Ras) February 23, 2023\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, 2022. Just before the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to get off the war path, cautioning that an invasion would only bring \"an abundance of pain filth, blood and death\" to their doorsteps.\n\nOne year into the war, those words continue to ring true.\n\nThe numbers are dizzying: hundreds of thousands of Russian men have escaped abroad to avoid being thrown into battle; millions of Ukrainians have been uprooted from their homes; tens of billions of dollars have poured into weaponry that is making war ever more lethal; and trillions more dollars estimated have been lost for the global economy. And even those figures don't do justice to the human and economic costs.\n\nOf the body count -- surely the most important tally, but kept under wraps by both sides -- all that can be said with certainty is that it is horrific. Western officials estimate it to be in the many tens of thousands and growing inexorably.\n\nBut Ukraine still exists; that in itself is a stinging defeat for the Kremlin.\n\n-- With files from The Associated Press\nSummary: On the eve of the one-year anniversary of Russia's peaceful resolution with Ukraine, U.K. activists dumped gallons of yellow and blue paint on the road in front of the London Russian embassy.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

(Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File)\n\nNEW YORK - The founder of the troubled digital start-up Ozy Media was arrested Thursday on fraud charges as part of a scheme to prop up the financially struggling company, which hemorrhaged millions of dollars before it shut down amid revelations of possibly deceptive business practices.\n\nThe arrest of Carlos Watson at a Manhattan hotel came after two of the company's top executives pleaded guilty this month to fraud charges, including Ozy's then-chief operating officer, Samir Rao, who allegedly impersonated a YouTube executive during a pitch to Goldman Sachs, a potential investor.\n\nThe guilty pleas were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe indictment accuses Watson of conspiring to commit securities fraud and wire fraud, as well as identity theft for his role in the impersonation of several media executives.\n\n\"We are really disappointed,\" Watson's attorney, Lanny Breuer, told the Journal after the arrest. \"We have been acting in good faith and believe we had a constructive dialogue with the government and are shocked by the actions this morning.\"\n\nScrutiny over the company deepened after the New York Times reported in October 2021 that an Ozy official had masqueraded as a YouTube executive in a failing attempt to get Goldman Sachs to infuse money into the struggling enterprise.\n\nShortly after, Ozy said it was shutting down.\n\n\"As alleged, Carlos Watson is a con man whose business strategy was based on outright deceit and fraud,\" said Breon Peace, the U.S. Attorney for the Brooklyn-based Eastern District of New York. \"He ran Ozy as a criminal organization rather than as a reputable media company.\"\n\nMichael J. Driscoll, the assistant director-in-charge of the FBI's New York field office said Watson \"repeatedly attempted to entice both investors and lenders through a series of deliberate deceptions and fabrications.\"\n\nAuthorities say Watson and his business partners, between 2018 and 2021, attempted to defraud investors and lenders of \"tens of millions of dollars through fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions\" about the company's debts and other key financial information.\n\nOn multiple occasions, the U.S. attorney's office said, Watson and his colleagues pretended to be other media executives to cover up earlier misrepresentations.\nSummary: The founder of the troubled digital start-up Ozy Media has been arrested on fraud charges as part of a plot to prop up the financially struggling company.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

No deaths have been reported.\n\nThe incidents have prompted public anger, with some Iranians accusing the government of negligence. Some parents have refused to let their children attend school.\n\nIn the latest incident, 15 schoolgirls were transferred to a hospital in Qom on February 22, the Qom News outlet reported, saying the students were in stable condition and under observation.\n\nThe first incident is believed to have occurred in November, when 18 schoolgirls in Qom were taken to a hospital after complaining of symptoms that included nausea, headaches, coughing, breathing difficulties, heart palpitations, and numbness and pain in their hands or legs.\n\nSince then, hundreds of students in Qom, mostly girls, have fallen ill with similar symptoms in a number of public schools, which are segregated by gender. Dozens have received treatment, while others have been hospitalized.\n\nAuthorities said they have not yet been able to determine the cause of the mysterious wave of sickness, despite conducting toxicology tests.\n\nMedical experts have not found any bacterial or viral infections in blood samples taken from sick students. The authorities have not yet dismissed the possibility that poisonous gas could have caused the illnesses, with some students reporting a strange smell in their classrooms.\n\nIran's chief prosecutor, Mohammad Javad Montazeri, suggested on February 21 that the incidents could be deliberate. In a letter to the state prosecutor in Qom, Montazeri said the \"worrying wave of some kind of poisoning\" in schools in the city indicate \"the possibility of intentional criminal actions.\"\n\nEarlier, Mojtaba Zolnour, a lawmaker from Qom, said the illnesses were \"abnormal\" and security officials were investigating. Another parliamentarian from Qom, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, suggested that fear and hysteria could have played a role.\n\nSome have speculated that religious extremists, in a bid to create fear and prevent girls from attending school, could be behind the incidents.\n\nLast week, Nafiseh Moradi, a researcher of Islamic studies at Al Zahra University, an all-female public university in Tehran, said in a commentary that it was suspicious that girls, not boys, were mainly affected by the illnesses. The article on Qom News was later removed.\n\nMany Iranians have accused the authorities of not doing enough to find the cause of the illnesses and prevent new cases. Some angry parents have refused to send their children to school.\n\n\"Of the 250 students in our school, only 50 attended classes,\" a teacher in Qom, who did not want to be named for fear of retribution, told RFE/RL's Radio Farda last week.\n\nA correspondent at the reformist Shargh daily who traveled to Qom reported this week that some schools in the city were \"unofficially\" closed.\n\nLast week, angry parents protested outside the governor's office and called for a transparent investigation. They also demanded that classes be held online, amid reports that the authorities were pressuring students to attend school.\n\nAn unnamed teacher at a girls' school in Qom told Shargh that they have been ordered to teach \"even if only one student\" was present in class.

No deaths have been reported.\n\nThe incidents have prompted public anger, with some Iranians accusing the government of negligence. Some parents have refused to let their children attend school.\n\nIn the latest incident, 15 schoolgirls were transferred to a hospital in Qom on February 22, the Qom News outlet reported, saying the students were in stable condition and under observation.\n\nThe first incident is believed to have occurred in November, when 18 schoolgirls in Qom were taken to a hospital after complaining of symptoms that included nausea, headaches, coughing, breathing difficulties, heart palpitations, and numbness and pain in their hands or legs.\n\nSince then, hundreds of students in Qom, mostly girls, have fallen ill with similar symptoms in a number of public schools, which are segregated by gender. Dozens have received treatment, while others have been hospitalized.\n\nAuthorities said they have not yet been able to determine the cause of the mysterious wave of sickness, despite conducting toxicology tests.\n\nMedical experts have not found any bacterial or viral infections in blood samples taken from sick students. The authorities have not yet dismissed the possibility that poisonous gas could have caused the illnesses, with some students reporting a strange smell in their classrooms.\n\nIran's chief prosecutor, Mohammad Javad Montazeri, suggested on February 21 that the incidents could be deliberate. In a letter to the state prosecutor in Qom, Montazeri said the \"worrying wave of some kind of poisoning\" in schools in the city indicate \"the possibility of intentional criminal actions.\"\n\nEarlier, Mojtaba Zolnour, a lawmaker from Qom, said the illnesses were \"abnormal\" and security officials were investigating. Another parliamentarian from Qom, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, suggested that fear and hysteria could have played a role.\n\nSome have speculated that religious extremists, in a bid to create fear and prevent girls from attending school, could be behind the incidents.\n\nLast week, Nafiseh Moradi, a researcher of Islamic studies at Al Zahra University, an all-female public university in Tehran, said in a commentary that it was suspicious that girls, not boys, were mainly affected by the illnesses. The article on Qom News was later removed.\n\nMany Iranians have accused the authorities of not doing enough to find the cause of the illnesses and prevent new cases. Some angry parents have refused to send their children to school.\n\n\"Of the 250 students in our school, only 50 attended classes,\" a teacher in Qom, who did not want to be named for fear of retribution, told RFE/RL's Radio Farda last week.\n\nA correspondent at the reformist Shargh daily who traveled to Qom reported this week that some schools in the city were \"unofficially\" closed.\n\nLast week, angry parents protested outside the governor's office and called for a transparent investigation. They also demanded that classes be held online, amid reports that the authorities were pressuring students to attend school.\n\nAn unnamed teacher at a girls' school in Qom told Shargh that they have been ordered to teach \"even if only one student\" was present in class. She also said students have been told not to share notes with classmates in an apparent bid to push more pupils to attend school in person.\n\nSome students who have fallen ill have complained of an \"unknown\" or \"unpleasant\" smell.\n\n\"My son recalled that for a moment there was the smell of rotten fish in the classroom,\" an unnamed woman whose son became sick was quoted as saying by the Tejarat News outlet. \"Then the school gave students face masks and told them to leave the classroom.\"\n\n\"Some of the children felt more ill than the others.
