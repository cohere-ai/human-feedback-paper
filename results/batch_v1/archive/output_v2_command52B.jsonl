The finding highlights the need for earlier hospice admission or other strategies to address increasing symptoms and disability at the end of life, the researchers said.\n\nThe study was published on September 12 in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.\n\nThe researchers examined information from a study of 562 people, aged 70 and older, who were not disabled when the study began but died over the following 16 years. Of these individuals, 244 (43.4 percent) were admitted to hospice during the last year of life. They were slightly older and more likely to have cognitive impairments (problems thinking and making decisions) than older adults who weren't admitted to hospice.\n\nThe researchers found that cancer and advanced dementia were the conditions that most often resulted in hospice admission. Older adults who were frail were least likely to be admitted to hospice. The most common condition leading to death was frailty, followed by organ failure, advanced dementia, and cancer.\n\nThe study also found that the duration of hospice care was less than 13 days for half of the study participants. This short duration suggests that healthcare providers might need to consider discussing referrals to hospice sooner with people who are approaching the end of their lives. Alternatively, providers may need to develop and test other ways to reduce the high burden of distressing symptoms and disability at the end of life, said the researchers.\n\n\"Failing or delaying to refer older persons to hospice at the end of life can place a high burden on caregivers and result in patient suffering,\" said Dr. Thomas Gill, the Humana Foundation Professor of Medicine and the study's first author.\n\nReferral to hospice at the end of life should be based on an older adult's burden of pain and other distressing symptoms, suggest the researchers.

According to NBCU, over 40 percent of Stay Tuned's viewers are watching at least three times a week, and the show already boasts 29 million unique viewers.

And while it's still too soon to tell whether or not Stay Tuned is a sustainable success, early signs are quite positive.\n\nAll of this means Snapchat users are getting premiere access to mobile content from their favorite NBC programs, and some new ones, too. It also allows the network to reach millions of fans instantly right in the palm of their hand on an app they're already using. It's also a win for NBC's advertisers who are associated with this premium content and get to reach users in a new and dynamic way.

But for that to happen, the vehicles will need new and more powerful sensors. Today's autonomous cars are ill prepared for high-speed driving, bad weather and other common situations.\n\nThe recent improvements in self-driving cars coincided with the improvements offered by new lidar sensors from a Silicon Valley company called Velodyne.

He explained that a battery with that much range would be extremely heavy, expensive, and impractical for normal driving due to its weight.\n\nThe most challenging aspect of selecting a battery that meets the needs of everyday consumers is finding the perfect balance between range, weight, and cost. Musk told his audience that modest improvements in battery range will take place over the next year, and result in batteries that deliver 500 kilometers of range or 300 miles. Musk has stated in the past that battery capacity would increase by approximately 5% a year for the foreseeable future, if not slightly more as Tesla's Gigafactory begins driving down cost of battery production via economies of scale.\n\nWhat followed was an idea that Elon tossed out, something he hasn't mentioned before, although others have. \"What if you had a trailer with a booster battery that you could use for long distance driving?\" he asked. Then he told the audience that he was running on about 1 hour of sleep in the past 48 hours and might not be thinking clearly.

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "Announces collaboration with US car-sharing company\n\nToyota has announced it will create a Mobility Services Platform (MSPF), which will collaborate with various service providers and telematics insurance. The MSPF will have \"various functions to support mobility services\" and \"leverage the Toyota Smart Center (TSC), the Toyota Big Data Center, and financial services\", according to a Toyota statement. The automaker will aggregate individual business functions it has created and offered to mobility service providers, including vehicle management systems and leasing programs. Toyota also announced that it has developed a Smart Key Box (SKB) for car-sharing users to lock and unlock doors or start the engine with their smartphone. The SKB is a physical unit to be placed in a car. The smartphone application receives codes from the SKB, which are authenticated with the device through Bluetooth low-energy communications for access to the vehicle. Toyota said that parameters for when the user can access the SKB are set and managed by TSC. Toyota's Mirai Creation Investment Limited Partnership has made a strategic investment (amount undisclosed) in car-sharing company Getaround. Toyota and Getaround will launch a pilot programme in January 2017 in San Francisco, California, United States. This will include a new financial product from Toyota Financial Services in which a lessee can use income from car-sharing to help generate his monthly lease payment. \"Based on the exploration results, Toyota will consider using the MSPF for other mobility services in Japan, like unmanned rent-a-car businesses,\" said the automaker.\n\nSignificance: Toyota seems to be playing a bit of catch-up in this mobility space, though it has invested in Uber. GM and Ford are among the companies that have already created mobility divisions and Audi recently announced a car-sharing trial. Ford's Peer-2-Peer experiment, announced in June 2015, leveraged Ford Credit for a similar program relative to offsetting lease payments with car-sharing income. In the United States, Ford's project used Getaround software. While many existing automakers offer smartphone apps that enable the car to be turned off or on or locked or unlocked from a phone, those apps are designed for owners and would be unable to react if a vehicle were kept too long or to other potential issues.

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "What do you do with an old salt mine? Turn it into a huge battery of course. We're all familiar with lithium-ion batteries like those in our phones, but on a utility scale, they are simply impractical. German company Ewe Gasspeicher GmbH has announced plans to build what could be called the world's biggest battery. The system, dubbed \"brine4power\" will be housed in huge underground salt caverns that were previously used as a natural gas storage facility. They each have a volume of 3.5 million cubic feet and will give the battery a capacity of up to 700MWh at an output of 120MW.\n\nIf you want energy storage on the scale of an electrical grid, there are currently two main options. The first and most common is pumped storage. It works like a standard hydroelectric power plant but in reverse. Pumps move vast amounts of water uphill to a holding pond thus storing energy in the form of gravitational potential energy. When you want to \"discharge\" the battery, you simply let the water run downhill and run the hydroelectric plant like normal.\n\nThe other main technology, and the one planned for the German project, is called a redox flow battery. It works by storing energy in the form of liquid electrolytes. There is a positive catholyte and a negative anolyte which are separated by a membrane that only allows ions to pass through. When charging, the ions move to the anolyte side and when discharging, they move back. This process takes up about 100 times the space per unit of energy compared to a lithium ion battery, but is much more environmentally friendly.\n\nRather than storing the electricity in another form like pumped storage does, the brine4power system stores it directly in the liquid. The system can theoretically supply a day's worth of power to about 75,000 homes. In other news, Elon Musk recently announced Tesla's plan to build the world's largest lithium-ion battery in Australia. Representing its true scale, this redox flow battery will be more than 5 times larger.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "sample_ix": 72, "model": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "response": " A German energy storage start-up, Ewe Gasspeicher, is planning to build a redox flow battery using old salt mines in the country.

That would preclude strangers or literal outsiders from piggy-backing on your connection or eavesdropping on your online activity.\n\nBeyond the widespread Internet access that Li-Fi could help provide around the world, the technology also has applications for reliable systems like smart city networks and Internet of Things connectivity in the smart homes of the future.\n\n\"The wider opportunity is to transform global communications by speeding up the process of bringing Internet and other data communication functionality to remote and poorer regions in a way not previously thought achievable due to lack of infrastructure and investment,\" said Tom Higgison, Edinburgh Research & Innovation's IP Project Manager.

The company has announced that its MasterPass digital wallet system will now be compatible with a slew of Facebook Messenger bots, including bots from FreshDirect, Subway, and The Cheesecake Factory. What this means is that users will be able to use MasterPass to complete transactions through those apps, without having to enter critical credit card information directly into the chat windows.\n\nMasterPass-enabled bots will work across a range of different services — including retail stores, restaurants, and more. The news isn't all that surprising — MasterCard actually announced a MasterPass-enabled bot called Getir last month, and it's likely we'll see more bots with payment capabilities like this come in as time goes on.\n\nUsing MasterPass-enabled bots is pretty easy. All you have to do is select to pay with MasterPass when you're checking out after selecting an item to buy, then enter your MasterPass password, and you'll be able to buy it quickly and securely.\n\nMasterCard isn't the only company working on payments through bots. A few months ago, PayPal launched a bot for Slack, aimed specifically at making it easier for users to send payments through the Slack app. While we have yet to see PayPal work with any third-party developers to integrate PayPal payments into their services, it certainly wouldn't be surprising.\n\nWe'll likely see more companies leverage bots for purchases over the next few years. Bots are tipped to completely change how we interact with companies — while we would have once used a company's app to interact with that company on our smartphone, bots are much easier and quicker to use.

A recent report from CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, concluded that the biggest miners are \"unprepared for the transition to a low-carbon economy\". 11 large mining companies were analysed and 9 opposed new climate regulations and only two stated support for \"climate regulation.\" Perhaps this is due to the fact that for many mining companies, the main threat lies in new charges on coal.\n\nFollowing this, THEnergy has realised that many of the large mining companies have started to focus on short-term actions regarding powering their mines: they have been preparing actions plans to react to carbon-reduction measures that might be adopted at the Paris climate conference. Large mining companies are also working on a strategy for renewable-energy projects such as wind and solar power at their mines. Companies like Rio Tinto, Glencore, BHP Billiton and Goldfields have already finished their first pilot power plants or have recently announced new projects.\n\nEnergy typically amounts to approximately 20–30% of the operating costs of a mine as such strict carbon-reduction decisions at the Paris climate conference could have a strong influence on the cost position of mines. As renewable energy can be less expensive than electricity from conventional energy sources, THEnergy stated, mining companies that manage to adapt early to the challenges of a low-carbon economy could gain significant competitive advantages.\n\n\"Mining companies are in the process of understanding that renewable energy can largely improve their competitive situation.

Now, the scientists say that Richards is in remission—and that they have cured a second baby as well, lending more evidence to the therapy's effectiveness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe treatment entailed collecting blood from donors, isolating healthy immune T-cells, and then using a genetic engineering tool known as TALENs to deactivate certain T-cell genes that would normally cause them to be rejected once transplanted into a leukemia patient. The T-cells were also engineered to attack cancer cells directly.\n\nSimilar treatments using engineered T-cells have been highly successful against blood cancers in other studies.

Most of the Big Six have made cuts in recent years as they react to slowing revenue growth and a dramatic shift in consumer behaviour, as customers increasingly bank online.\n\nThe slowing revenue growth stems from weak Canadian economic activity, low interest rates and a decreasing pace of loan growth, forcing banks to cut their expenses. The shift in consumer behaviour comes as the banks gear up for rising competition from savvy financial technology – or fintech – firms, pushing banks to invest huge amounts of money to increase their own technology talent pool and develop innovative online services, while making deep cuts in more traditional banking.\n\n\"We have written in the past about the digitization of banking and the evolving role of the branch network.

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "Clean energy investment surged last year, alongside renewable power that flowed into provincial grids from new solar, wind, and hydro projects. Our latest report plugs in.\n\nAs federal candidates leaders debate how best to manage Canada's energy resources, we've released the most authoritative report to date on Canada's clean energy performance. Tracking the Energy Revolution — Canada 2015 outlines record setting progress, clean energy champions, milestones, flagship projects.\n\nIt also offers a hint of what Canada's next federal government can do to set the tone.\n\nHere are the top three takeaways:\n\n1. Investment and jobs are both on the rise\n\nInvestment in clean energy climbed 88 percent in 2014 to nearly $11 billion. That's almost double the investment in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors combined. Also, employment in clean energy industry grew 14 percent—the fastest such rate of job growth in the country.\n\n2. The secret ingredient is policy\n\nLast year Ontario attracted nearly half of the nation's clean energy investment, and it wasn't by accident. The province's Green Energy Act last year spurred Canada's biggest wind power deal ever (CAD$2.8 billion), and the highest solar tally, too (CAD$1.6 billion).\n\n3. Ottawa can take Canada's clean energy industry to the next level\n\nThe news on clean energy is good, but with federal leadership, it could be terrific. Unlike Washington DC, Ottawa's pretty much been ignoring this sector. We hope and expect this report will serve as a flashing neon sign for federal parties: There's a huge opportunity here; get on board and show us what you can do\n\nOne thing is clear: Clean energy is the climate change solution, and a huge economic opportunity for a nation that seems fixated on getting oil and gas to market. Our report offers an accessible and well-curated snapshot of the good news, and the opportunities still to be captured.\n\nFor the full rundown of our nation's clean energy performance, browse the full report. An electronic press kit also includes images and other assets that are also available to media. Media release here.\n\nWe produce both our Tracking the Energy Revolution reports (we released the global edition in July) to inform governments and inspire policy leadership.\n\nFor media assets, please see the \"For the Media\" section under Resources for the press kit.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "sample_ix": 141, "model": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "response": " Investment in clean energy in Canada has reached a record high, with nearly $11bn spent in 2014, according to a new report by the Brookfield Institute for Innovation + Entrepreneurship.

The Ontario government's Green Energy Act was a major driver of investment, with the province attracting almost half of the country's clean energy investment last year.

It is calculated by dividing the company's total assets by its total liabilities.\n\nThe asset to debt ratio is a measure of the company's financial leverage. A high asset to debt ratio can indicate that the company is using too much debt to finance its operations, which can be risky. A low asset to debt ratio can indicate that the company is using too little debt to finance its operations, which can be conservative.\n\nThere are a few different ways to calculate the asset to debt ratio. The most common method is to use the following formula:\n\nAsset to debt ratio = Total assets / Total liabilities\n\nAnother method is to use the following formula:\n\nAsset to debt ratio = Net worth / Total liabilities\n\nIn both formulas, \"total assets\" refers to the total value of all the assets owned by the company, including both tangible and intangible assets. \"Total liabilities\" refers to the total value of all the liabilities owed by the company, including both short-term and long-term liabilities. \"Net worth\" refers to the total value of all the equity owned by the company.\n\nThe asset to debt ratio is typically expressed as a percentage. A high asset to debt ratio can indicate that the company is using too much debt to finance its operations, while a low asset to debt ratio can indicate that the company is using too little debt to finance its operations."}

Some people cope with this by making major changes to their lives, such as changing jobs, changing relationships, or changing their appearance.  Other people cope with this by trying to accept the fact that their lives are half over, and that they will never be as young as they once were.  There is no one right way to cope with a midlife crisis, but there are some strategies that can help.  One strategy is to try to find ways to feel younger, such as by taking care of your health, or by spending time with young people.  Another strategy is to try to find ways to feel more fulfilled, such as by finding a new hobby, or by volunteering for a cause you believe in.  Finally, some people find that talking to a therapist can help them work through their midlife crisis."}

First, let me explain a little about what credit is, and what it’s used for.  When you buy something on credit, you’re borrowing money from a bank or other lender, and agreeing to pay it back later.  So, when you borrow money, you’re building up a credit history, which is a record of how you’ve borrowed money in the past, and how you’ve paid it back.  Credit history is important because it gives a sense of how responsible you are with money, and how likely you are to pay back any money you borrow in the future.  When you have a good credit history, you’re a good credit risk, and banks and other lenders will be more likely to lend you money in the future."}

Use a variety of units, including units that are strong against ashnard’s weaknesses, as well as units that are strong against ashnard’s strengths.  This will help you have a well-rounded team.\n4.  Be sure to use your healing units wisely, as ashnard can deal a lot of damage.  Be sure to use them to keep your team healthy, and to heal them up after they take damage.\n5.  Be patient, and take your time during the fight.  Ashnard is a tough boss, and it might take a while to defeat him.  Don’t get discouraged if you don’t defeat him right away."}

One way to reduce drinking at parties is to provide other activities that don’t involve drinking.  For example, you could organize a dance party or a movie night.  Or you could make it a “no alcohol” party, and tell everyone in advance that they’re not allowed to drink.  If you want to try this, I recommend having a sign-up sheet for the party, and telling everyone in advance that it’s a no-alcohol party.  Then, if someone shows up with alcohol, you can ask them to leave."}

{"dataset": "wikihow", "prompt": "Can you tell me how to deal with backstabbers?", "sample_ix": 146, "model": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "response": " Hmm, yes, it’s certainly common to experience some level of betrayal from people we trust, and in such situations it’s often helpful to try to practice some form of self-compassion and forgiveness.  For example, you might try to remind yourself that all people are imperfect and flawed, and that even people who have shown themselves to be trustworthy can make mistakes or act in ways that disappoint us.  You could also try to be more mindful of your own thoughts and feelings in such situations, and avoid dwelling on them too much or letting them affect your mood or outlook too heavily.  Finally, you might try to practice forgiveness and reconciliation with the person who betrayed you, if possible, as this can often help to heal the relationship and restore trust.  Overall I would say that the most important thing is to try to cultivate some degree of emotional resilience and compassion towards yourself and others, which can help you to deal with difficult situations and maintain a positive outlook on life.  Does this make sense?  Let me know if you have any further questions or comments."}
