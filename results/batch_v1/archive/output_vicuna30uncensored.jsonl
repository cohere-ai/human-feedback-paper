This means that businesses can quickly respond to changes in demand, and only pay for what they use.\n\n2. Cost savings: By using cloud computing, businesses can avoid the upfront costs associated with purchasing and maintaining their own hardware and infrastructure. Additionally, cloud computing providers often offer flexible pricing models that allow businesses to pay only for the resources they use, further reducing costs.\n\n3. Accessibility: Cloud computing allows businesses to access their data and applications from anywhere, as long as they have an internet connection.

Subsequent to power generation, the hot engine exhaust is used to heat the torrefaction reactor and supplement the biomass material drying. The reactors then utilize vibratory conveying technology to move material within its sealed components. Each reactor is coupled to a bespoke syngas cleaning system for the removal of tars and connected to a gas engine to create a reliable production line.\n\nAlthough the process is similar to charcoal production, \"it takes place in a much lower temperature environment that requires less exotic and less expensive materials, which results in biofuels with more favorable combustion properties, better mechanical and storage properties, and higher energy density,\" CEG states on its website.\n\nAccording to Baltania, the energy density and grind-ability of renewable and sustainable bio-coal pellets are similar to thermal steam coal and significantly higher than that of white wood pellets or wood chips.

[Peter Muthomi, Standard]\n\nTired of looking for elusive white-collar jobs, a group of young farmers decided to think out of the box.

But for that to happen, the vehicles will need new and more powerful sensors. Today's autonomous cars are ill prepared for high-speed driving, bad weather and other common situations.\n\nThe recent improvements in self-driving cars coincided with the improvements offered by new lidar sensors from a Silicon Valley company called Velodyne. These sensors gave cars a way of measuring distances to nearby vehicles, pedestrians and other objects. They also provided Google and other companies with a way of mapping urban roadways in three dimensions, so that cars will know exactly where they are at any given moment — something GPS cannot always provide.\n\nBut these lidar sensors have additional shortcomings. They can gather information only about objects that are relatively close to them, which limits how fast the cars can travel. Their measurements aren't always detailed enough to distinguish one object from another. And when multiple driverless cars are close together, their signals can become garbled.\n\nOther devices can pick up some of slack. Cameras are a better way of identifying pedestrians and street signs, for example, and radar works over longer distances. That's why today's self-driving cars track their surroundings through so many different sensors.

But the projected jump for next year is much steeper, the CBO says, \"largely because of short-term market uncertainty—in particular, insurers' uncertainty about whether federal funding for certain subsidies that are currently available will continue to be provided— and an increase in the percentage of the population living in areas with only one insurer in the marketplace.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has not yet said whether it will continue to pay roughly $7 billion a year for so-called cost-sharing reductions — subsidies that help reduce deductibles and co-pays for low-income enrollees. In the meantime, it has slashed spending on advertising and outreach, and shortened the enrollment period to six weeks from about three months.

Now, however, POS systems contain much more than basic transaction functionality.\n\nDetermine Your Needs\n\nHonestly, assess the size of your business and how large you plan to grow it over the next few years. If you own a small restaurant and never plan to open a second location, then you don't need multi-location support and you also likely do not need an inventory system that can handle 500,000 unique identifiers. If you are running a small restaurant, chances are, you would be just fine with a POS system that provides basic inventory functionality, timesheet integration, and a table map in addition to basic transaction functionality.\n\nThe reverse is also true; if you own a local chain of restaurants, then you will need multi-location support if you want to be able to manage all of your locations together, rather than running all of the sites separately.\n\nWhat Are The Main Differences Between Small and Large Business POS Systems?\n\nFirst, price is going to be a factor to consider. A POS system designed for a medium or large business is going to demand a premium that is often more than a small business owner can afford or is willing to pay. For larger companies, this cost is worth the extra functionality that these systems offer.\n\nPOS systems designed for small businesses are often robust enough to manage your daily needs, but they are also simple enough that you will not have to dedicate several hours a week to just maintaining your POS system.

Savills view is that this is highly unlikely unless it is part of a much wider reform of property taxation.\n\nWhile the stamp duty burden on buyers at the top end of the housing market has increased significantly since the first reforms in December 2014, triggering falls in the value of high-value homes and slowing decision-making in the prime markets, the tax is proving a nice little earner for the Chancellor.\n\nFigures published by HMRC show that overall receipts from stamp duty continue to rise. In the second quarter of 2017 the Treasury earned £2.35 billion from stamp duty. 12 months ago that figure stood at £1.98 billion, meaning earnings are up by about 19 per cent year on year (see chart below). Three years ago, receipts stood at £1.82 billion.\n\nAt the same time, sales of homes worth over £1 million have remained remarkably robust, totalling 17,700 in the past year. Sales in the £1-2 million price bracket are actually 4 per cent higher than before the major changes of December 2014, though they have softened by 8 oer cent in the past year. Above the £2million mark, sales fell by -14 per cent in the past year but have definitely not collapsed as some suggest. In the immediate aftermath of the December 2014 reform there was surprisingly little change.\n\nFinally, a high proportion of these top-end sales are paying the extra 3 per cent levied on 'additional homes', further boosting tax receipts from this end of the market. Between £1-2 million a third of sales incurred the 3 per cent surcharge and above £2 million that rises to 44 per cent.\n\nWe don't believe that autumn will bring a change to stamp duty.

{"dataset": "curation", "prompt": "Now that Republicans have failed to pass multiple versions of health care bills to repeal and replace Obamacare, or just repeal it, there's only one GOP health care bill left floating around: one offered by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and cosponsored by Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV).\n\nIn broad strokes, the plan would reduce spending over time by converting Medicaid payments to the states into block grants while gradually reducing federal support. It would also give states more leeway to place limits on health care coverage.\n\nBut an analysis by the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities published on Thursday finds that the plan would have effects similar to other Republican plans scored by the Congressional Budget Office: \"It would cause many millions of people to lose coverage, radically restructure and deeply cut Medicaid, increase out-of-pocket costs for individual market consumers, and weaken or eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\"\n\nAccording to CBPP, the reductions would hit a handful states especially hard: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, and Virginia, plus the District of Columbia. These states embraced expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and a result account for a large share of spending under the expansion. The Cassidy-Graham bill takes aim at that spending and essentially redirects the money toward non-expansion states, even as it reduces payments overall. Funding for Medicaid expansion would end entirely after 2026.\n\nThis redistributive effort appears to be central to the political strategy behind the bill. Former Sen. Rick Santorum recently told Breitbart that he has \"no question that we can get very broad support among the Republican base and frankly this will get support from a Democrat or two. The reason is because of the way that Obamacare is structured, it benefits a handful of states.\"\n\nTaking from New York and giving to Alabama may indeed be a winning strategy. That may be why former Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Andy Slavitt recently tweeted that \"The most viable effort 2 repeal the ACA is Graham Cassidy Heller.\"\n\nYou can review the CBPP analysis in full here.\n\nGenerate a summary:\n", "sample_ix": 125, "response": "<s>  With the failure of previous Republican health care bills, the Cassidy-Graham bill remains the only GOP proposal still in play.

It's become very popular with the younger generation, who seem to enjoy endless hours of puking rainbows and making themselves into slices of toast.\n\nIn 2016, media giant NBC decided to capitalize on this popularity by producing original content for some of its hit programs just for Snapchat users. With the vertical video layout of Snapchat, NBC didn't want to simply resuse video clips from programs. Instead, NBC decided to produce new content.\n\nPopular singing competition The Voice was one of the first featured on Snapchat. The series includes clips from the show's judges, as well as user-generated singing auditions. Prospective contestants can submit clips showcasing their talents at voicesnaps.com, where they will be reviewed by the show's judges, who will pick some of the hopefuls to perform in the upcoming season.\n\nBut in addition to adding new content for existing shows, NBC has also decided to launch programming that is entirely exclusive to Snapchat, like its show Stay Tuned. First debuted in July, the twice-daily headline news show features around four to five news stories focusing on the day's most important events. And thus far, it looks to be doing very, very well. According to NBCU, over 40 percent of Stay Tuned's viewers are watching at least three times a week, and the show already boasts 29 million unique viewers. As TechCrunch points out, that's about three times the number of viewers who watch NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt.\n\nAround 60 percent of the show's viewers are under the age of 25, which makes sense given Snapchat's generally youthful user base. And while it's still too soon to tell whether or not Stay Tuned is a sustainable success, early signs are quite positive.\n\nAll of this means Snapchat users are getting premiere access to mobile content from their favorite NBC programs, and some new ones, too. It also allows the network to reach millions of fans instantly right in the palm of their hand on an app they're already using. It's also a win for NBC's advertisers who are associated with this premium content and get to reach users in a new and dynamic way.

He claims that the result is an AI that's capable of exhibiting 85 percent accuracy in correctly determining an author.\n\n\"More than 50 mathematical parameters stand behind every author's writing identity,\" he continued. \"So the issue is of a striking complexity: it's extremely difficult to define and assess style features of a vexing number of authors, and to implement the extracted knowledge into an NLP technology.

The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like macadamia nut milk, soon will not be asked to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has proposed new guidelines for the labeling and naming of PBMA products in response to their decreased market availability and unpopularity among consumers.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Israeli airlines were banned from the airspace of both Oman and Saudi Arabia. That meant flights to India and Southeast Asia, which would naturally head east from Israel, had to dip south, crossing over Jordan and following the Red Sea down to the bottom of the Arabian Peninsula, before hooking northeast.\n\nNow, all that is set to change. Following the Saudi government's announcement in July 2022 that the country's airspace would open up to all carriers, Oman has followed suit.\n\nEl Al has posted a map of their current and new routes to Southeast Asia From El Al Israel\n\nOn February 23, the Civil Aviation Authority of Oman announced that it will open its airspace to \"all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflying\" - effectively ending the ban on El Al, Israir and Arkia, Israel's three airlines.\n\nIn a tweet, it said the move was \"part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfil its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, which stipulates non-discrimination between civil aircrafts used in international air navigation.\"\n\nThe move could cut Israeli carriers' flight times to Asia by up to three hours, Jonathan Sivarajah, an El Al frequent flier and Israeli aviation commentator, told CNN.\n\nAs part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfill its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, the Civil Aviation Authority affirms that the Sultanate's airspace is open for all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflyuing. pic.twitter.com/jNaqqDxZM1 -- hyy'@ lTWyrn lmdny (@CAAOMN) February 23, 2023\n\nHe added that it \"opens up further opportunities [for the airlines], not only to Asia but potentially to Australia, too.\"\n\nEl Al's nonstop flight from Tel Aviv to Bangkok is currently listed as taking 10 hours 45 minutes. But a nonstop flight on Royal Jordanian from Amman - 100 miles east of Tel Aviv - takes eight hours 10 minutes. In fact, flying Tel Aviv to Amman, and then on to Bangkok can be quicker, even including transfer time at the airport - a connecting flight can take as little as nine hours 55 minutes on Royal Jordanian.\n\nWhen the airline was banned from Saudi airspace, El Al flights from Tel Aviv to Mumbai took seven hours 45 minutes. That flight time was then slashed to five hours 15 minutes, before the route was put on hold.\n\nAs the announcement was made, El Al swiftly posted a map of their old and new routes to Southeast Asia on Instagram.\n\nSivarajah said that until now, competing international carriers have \"flooded\" Israel with quicker flights than what the country's own airlines were able to provide.\n\n\"Tel Aviv-bound foreign carriers such as Air India could operate over territory which El Al couldn't.

The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives.

The transfers involved more than a billion dollars worth of assets that were meant to back stablecoins belonging to the exchange's customers. Forbes claimed that the transfers were \"eerily similar\" to FTX's activities before its implosion.\n\nBinance transferred stablecoin collateral to Alameda Research\n\nAccording to on-chain data gathered by Forbes, the transfers started on 17 August last year. Binance reportedly transferred the funds that backed $1 billion worth of B-peg USDC belonging to its customers, to multiple hedge funds. The report found that the B-peg USD Coins were left with no collateral till as late as December 2022. This went against the crypto exchange's long-standing claim that the B-peg tokens it issued are backed 1:1.\n\nOf the $1.8 billion that was transferred out of the crypto exchange's peg wallet without informing the customers, nearly $1.1 billion was sent to Cumberland, a crypto trading firm based in Chicago. Forbes report claimed that Cumberland may have helped Binance to convert the stablecoin collateral into its own stablecoin, BUSD, as part of the crypto market's aggressive campaign to increase BUSD's share in the stablecoin market.

(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)\n\nRaimondo spoke at Georgetown University as she moved on to the next phase of the heady task of handing out about $50 billion in government funds to spur semiconductor manufacturing and research in the years ahead. The money was approved in 2022 when President Biden signed the CHIPs and Science Act into law.\n\nThe speech comes after months of intense lobbying from the semiconductor sector. Companies like Intel (INTC); Micron (MU), IBM (IBM) and even the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) have scored visits from President Biden to tout plans for new U.S. plants in the works-- and they appear well positioned to take large pieces of the coming windfall. Meanwhile, Raimondo and other officials promise that the funds will be spread across the industry among a range of companies of all sizes.\n\n\"Everyone is going to want to know, how much money is Intel getting, how much money is Samsung getting,\" she said during her remarks, promising answers in the weeks ahead. The Commerce Secretary focused her remarks instead on America's national security imperatives and what the semiconductor fabrication plants and research facilities will look like.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel's Vice President of U.S. Government Relations Allen Thompson praised the rollout and this week's focus on building semiconductor ecosystems in a statement to Yahoo Finance calling the law \"the most significant competition policy in our generation.\" He also noted added that his company has already announced $43.5 billion of investments in their U.S. sites since the law's passage.\n\nThe overall ambition is for the U.S. to supplant places like Taiwan, South Korea, and China to become the \"premier destination in the world\" for the sector, Raimondo said. She added during a briefing with reporters that \"every chip company will need to be in the United States of America long after the subsidy runs out because they will have to and want to be here because we will have built that ecosystem.\"\n\n'That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable'\n\nThe Biden administration's challenge: reverse what expert call a downward spiral for the industry in the U.S. in recent decades. American semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% in 1990 to only 12% in recent years, according to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nThe situation is even worse with the world's most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019. But the recent the announcements from companies like Intel for new U.S. plants could grow U.S. manufacturing in the years ahead.\n\nRaimondo noted that, at the moment, the U.S. relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for 92% of our advanced chips. \"That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable,\" she said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signs into law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 in August. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nRaimondo also reached out to semiconductor companies focused on chip design like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA) who had been worried about being left out of the government windfall as the bill was being negotiated.\n\n\"Our success will be short-lived\" if we focus only on manufacturing Raimondo said Thursday, adding that R&D is what will make it a longer term success.\n\n\"It's one thing to get companies here, we need them to stay here,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement to Yahoo Finance, Dario Gil, a senior vice president at IBM, congratulated the administration on the unveiling and added \"as a global leader in semiconductor research and development, IBM stands ready to work with our academic and manufacturing partners to implement new technologies and rapidly scale industrial innovation.\"\n\nThe new law has $39 billion earmarked for semiconductor manufacturers with an additional $11 billion to go to companies as well as universities and others for chip research and design purposes. In addition, the law includes an investment tax credit of up to 25 percent towards a manufacturer's capital expenditures.\n\nReturn on investment? National security.\n\nRaimondo compared the effort to President Lincoln's creation of the land-grant university system, nuclear security in the 1940s, and John F. Kennedy's famous call to put a man on the moon.\n\nShe noted that the 1960s saw an explosion of PhDs in the science and engineering fields to back up Kennedy's 1961 call--and she is hoping for something similar in the years ahead in universities and high schools to create a bigger semiconductor industry workforce.\n\nThe next step in the administration's plan will come next Tuesday when Raimondo's department unveils the formal application that manufacturing companies will need to access the money. \"It's going to be a very comprehensive application, which will be crystal clear about the specific criteria that we'll be looking for and the information we need from companies,\" Raimondo told reporters.\n\nThe speech also nodded to concerns that the billions, once they are signed over, could end going to things like stock buybacks. During her speech, Raimondo promised to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars and said she would will demand transparency from companies. A recent letter from prominent lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called on the administration to be vigilant on the buyback issue, saying it could undermine the national security goals of the program.\n\n\"I expect to be held accountable,\" Raimondo said.\n\nMeanwhile, the race for the money remains well underway with places like Arizona making a play to be one of the manufacturing hubs.\n\nRaimondo said she hopes the $50 billion in government funds will lead to somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 billion in private investment.\n\n\"Get in the boat, row with us to achieve this mission,\" she said during the speech in a comment directed towards private investors around the country. \"I don't want to spend a dime that I don't have to.\"\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or Android\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube\nSummary: The Biden administration is unveiling audacious goals Thursday for how it will seek to get the most bang for the millions it has at its disposal to spur the semiconductor sector in the U.S. in the years ahead.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN --\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope just peered into a celestial Pandora's box to see what lies beyond a megacluster of galaxies.\n\nThe space observatory observed Pandora's Cluster, also known as Abell 2744, where three massive clusters of galaxies are merging.\n\nThe group of galaxy clusters acts as a magnifying glass for the objects behind it. Called gravitational lensing, this natural phenomenon created a deep-field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies. Deep-field observations are long exposures of regions of the sky that can show distant, difficult-to-see objects.\n\nWebb has already captured several deep-field views of the universe since it began scientific observations in July. Gravitational lensing is crucial for astronomers because it can uncover features of the early universe that are otherwise impossible to see.\n\nPrevious images of the central core of Pandora's Cluster came courtesy of the Hubble Space Telescope. Webb's latest observation of the cluster has revealed never-before-seen details in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nAstronomers in the UNCOVER program, or Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization, used Webb's unique Near-Infrared Camera for 30 hours to capture detailed long-exposure images. The latest photo released Wednesday stitches together four of those images into a panorama that includes 50,000 sources of near-infrared light.\n\nHundreds of faint arced lines in the lower-right image are actually distant galaxies that scientists weren't able to spot with Hubble.\n\nThe many dots of light in the new Webb image represent galaxies. Gravitational lensing can distort the appearance of distant galaxies, making them appear different from the galaxies in the foreground of the image -- which is why the distant galaxies resemble arcs of light.\n\nNext, the research team will go through all of the data in the image and pinpoint galaxies that they'd like to study further this summer to gain new insights into the early universe.\nSummary: The James Gunn Space Telescope captured a new image of Pandora's Cluster, a megacluster of galaxies that allowed astronomers to peer into the distant universe and observe never-before-seen details.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like soy milk, may not be required to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk.

(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)\n\nRaimondo spoke at Georgetown University as she moved on to the next phase of the heady task of handing out about $50 billion in government funds to spur semiconductor manufacturing and research in the years ahead. The money was approved in 2022 when President Biden signed the CHIPs and Science Act into law.\n\nThe speech comes after months of intense lobbying from the semiconductor sector. Companies like Intel (INTC); Micron (MU), IBM (IBM) and even the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) have scored visits from President Biden to tout plans for new U.S. plants in the works-- and they appear well positioned to take large pieces of the coming windfall. Meanwhile, Raimondo and other officials promise that the funds will be spread across the industry among a range of companies of all sizes.\n\n\"Everyone is going to want to know, how much money is Intel getting, how much money is Samsung getting,\" she said during her remarks, promising answers in the weeks ahead. The Commerce Secretary focused her remarks instead on America's national security imperatives and what the semiconductor fabrication plants and research facilities will look like.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel's Vice President of U.S. Government Relations Allen Thompson praised the rollout and this week's focus on building semiconductor ecosystems in a statement to Yahoo Finance calling the law \"the most significant competition policy in our generation.\" He also noted added that his company has already announced $43.5 billion of investments in their U.S. sites since the law's passage.\n\nThe overall ambition is for the U.S. to supplant places like Taiwan, South Korea, and China to become the \"premier destination in the world\" for the sector, Raimondo said. She added during a briefing with reporters that \"every chip company will need to be in the United States of America long after the subsidy runs out because they will have to and want to be here because we will have built that ecosystem.\"\n\n'That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable'\n\nThe Biden administration's challenge: reverse what expert call a downward spiral for the industry in the U.S. in recent decades. American semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% in 1990 to only 12% in recent years, according to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nThe situation is even worse with the world's most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019. But the recent the announcements from companies like Intel for new U.S. plants could grow U.S. manufacturing in the years ahead.\n\nRaimondo noted that, at the moment, the U.S. relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for 92% of our advanced chips. \"That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable,\" she said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signs into law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 in August. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nRaimondo also reached out to semiconductor companies focused on chip design like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA) who had been worried about being left out of the government windfall as the bill was being negotiated.\n\n\"Our success will be short-lived\" if we focus only on manufacturing Raimondo said Thursday, adding that R&D is what will make it a longer term success.\n\n\"It's one thing to get companies here, we need them to stay here,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement to Yahoo Finance, Dario Gil, a senior vice president at IBM, congratulated the administration on the unveiling and added \"as a global leader in semiconductor research and development, IBM stands ready to work with our academic and manufacturing partners to implement new technologies and rapidly scale industrial innovation.\"\n\nThe new law has $39 billion earmarked for semiconductor manufacturers with an additional $11 billion to go to companies as well as universities and others for chip research and design purposes. In addition, the law includes an investment tax credit of up to 25 percent towards a manufacturer's capital expenditures.\n\nReturn on investment? National security.\n\nRaimondo compared the effort to President Lincoln's creation of the land-grant university system, nuclear security in the 1940s, and John F. Kennedy's famous call to put a man on the moon.\n\nShe noted that the 1960s saw an explosion of PhDs in the science and engineering fields to back up Kennedy's 1961 call--and she is hoping for something similar in the years ahead in universities and high schools to create a bigger semiconductor industry workforce.\n\nThe next step in the administration's plan will come next Tuesday when Raimondo's department unveils the formal application that manufacturing companies will need to access the money. \"It's going to be a very comprehensive application, which will be crystal clear about the specific criteria that we'll be looking for and the information we need from companies,\" Raimondo told reporters.\n\nThe speech also nodded to concerns that the billions, once they are signed over, could end going to things like stock buybacks. During her speech, Raimondo promised to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars and said she would will demand transparency from companies. A recent letter from prominent lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called on the administration to be vigilant on the buyback issue, saying it could undermine the national security goals of the program.\n\n\"I expect to be held accountable,\" Raimondo said.\n\nMeanwhile, the race for the money remains well underway with places like Arizona making a play to be one of the manufacturing hubs.\n\nRaimondo said she hopes the $50 billion in government funds will lead to somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 billion in private investment.\n\n\"Get in the boat, row with us to achieve this mission,\" she said during the speech in a comment directed towards private investors around the country. \"I don't want to spend a dime that I don't have to.\"\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or Android\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube\nSummary: The Biden administration is unveiling audacious goals Thursday for how it will seek to get the most bang for the millions it has at its disposal to hinder the semiconductor sector in the U.S. in the years ahead.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Key to managing that growth is FIMS, which will \"enable drones and other low-level operators to safely integrate with existing airspace users\", according to Airservices Australia.\n\nThe system will act as the \"connector\" between UAS and Australia's current airspace management, says Courtney Meares-Whitty, head of the FIMS initiave for Airservices Australia.\n\nGumley says the UTM programme completed field-testing in November of multiple FIMS prototypes developed with private sector partners and is now shifting into the delivery phase - with a target of 2025.\n\nAs it rolls out FIMS over the next three years, the project will also deploy newly developed technologies, including access to improved geospatial data for UAS operators, a surveillance network for tracking drones and a method for the \"detection of non-cooperative drones\".\n\nThe ultimate goal, Gumley says, is to fully-integrate FIMS into the existing air traffic management system for civil aviation - as opposed to a bifurcated or \"segregated\" system in which UAS are managed separately from conventional aircraft.\n\n\"Segregated integration is not a sustainable model for the future,\" he notes.\n\nAirservices Australia says its focus on safely incorporating large numbers of small drones into the existing aviation ecosystem \"will foster growth in the UAS market\".\n\nThe private sector appears to agree with that assessment.\n\n\"UTM solutions are essential,\" says Phillip Swadling, technical director of avionics at Thales. \"The lack of harmonised standards are holding back drone business development,\" he adds.\n\n\"We need practical and pragmatic solutions that facilitate the integration of emerging technologies,\" says Zac Kennedy, chief regulatory officer at Swoop Aero - a Melbourne-based start-up developing networks of commercial UAS to fill gaps in existing logistics systems.\n\nGumley says the goal of the UTM programme is to offer a service that is as frictionless as possible, with \"airspace authorisation measured in seconds, not weeks\" for UAS operators. He notes Airservices Australia is working to deliver automatic airspace approval at all of the country's 29 aerodromes by end of 2023.\n\nUnder an initiative called OneSky Australia, Canberra intends to streamline airspace management even further by combining the civil and military aviation control systems. Airservices Australia and the Department of Defence are jointly developing that infrastructure, known as the Civil Military Air Traffic Management System (CMATS).\n\nGumley says CMATS also will eventually incorporate the launch and recovery of space-bound rockets.\n\nSwadling argues for government to take a more active role in setting a national strategic policy on UAS, which will guide private sector development.\n\n\"There is a need for an integrated and uniform UAS strategy at the national level,\" he says.\nSummary: National air traffic management agency Airservices Australia says it has shifted from prototyping to the delivery phase of an effort to deploy an airspace management tool for small, uncrewed air vehicles such as commercial unmanned air vehicles.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Called gravitational lensing, this natural phenomenon created a deep-field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies. Deep-field observations are long exposures of regions of the sky that can show distant, difficult-to-see objects.\n\nWebb has already captured several deep-field views of the universe since it began scientific observations in July. Gravitational lensing is crucial for astronomers because it can uncover features of the early universe that are otherwise impossible to see.\n\nPrevious images of the central core of Pandora's Cluster came courtesy of the Hubble Space Telescope. Webb's latest observation of the cluster has revealed never-before-seen details in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nAstronomers in the UNCOVER program, or Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization, used Webb's unique Near-Infrared Camera for 30 hours to capture detailed long-exposure images. The latest photo released Wednesday stitches together four of those images into a panorama that includes 50,000 sources of near-infrared light.\n\nHundreds of faint arced lines in the lower-right image are actually distant galaxies that scientists weren't able to spot with Hubble.\n\nThe many dots of light in the new Webb image represent galaxies. Gravitational lensing can distort the appearance of distant galaxies, making them appear different from the galaxies in the foreground of the image -- which is why the distant galaxies resemble arcs of light.\n\nNext, the research team will go through all of the data in the image and pinpoint galaxies that they'd like to study further this summer to gain new insights into the early universe.\nSummary: The James Webb Space Telescope captured a fresh image of Pandora's Cluster, a megacluster of galaxies that allowed astronomers to peer into the distant universe and observe never-before-seen details.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

In the U.S. the app got banned in December for all federal government devices - due to concerns that the app may be spying. TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, is based in China.

And now, Politico reports that European Commission staff is banned from using TikTok over security concerns.Allegedly, there are ties between Chinese tech companies and the Chinese Communist Party, and the West is getting alarmed. Also, people are getting more and more concerned with the possibility that TikTok collects info from all over the world.An unnamed official told the folks at Politico that EU staff was ordered to remove TikTok from their official devices and that the app should be removed from their personal devices as well if they happen to have work-related apps on said devices (or they can delete work-related apps from their personal devices and leave TikTok).EC employees received the information in an email sent on Thursday morning.

But the messenger RNA-focused biotech's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings also hint that the post-pandemic future that it has been building toward is taking shape as newer mRNA-based products inch closer to the market, particularly in infectious diseases like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and oncology.\n\nModerna announced its earnings on 23 February, reporting fourth quarter revenues of $5.1bn and full year revenues of $19.3bn, nearly all of which - $4.9bn and $18.4bn, respectively - came from global sales of Spikevax.\n\nBut the firm is keen to establish itself as a multi-product company. \"The company continues to expand at a rapid pace,\" CEO Stephane Bancel told Moderna's same-day earnings call. \"We now have three commercial COVID-19 vaccine products. We have four programs in Phase III.\"\n\nHe added that the company is on track to expand its commercial portfolio \"very soon\" and overall has 48 programs underway.\n\n\"Our $18bn of cash balance at the end of the year is enabling us to scale across research, clinical development, manufacturing, commercial and G&A,\" he said.\n\nBigger Drop In Pandemic Sales To Come\n\nAlong with other drug makers that have experienced record revenues and profits from COVID-19 vaccines and drugs - such as Pfizer Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. and Gilead Sciences, Inc. - Moderna has begun to see its sales take a downward trajectory. For the fourth quarter, the sales figure for Spikevax and related bivalent vaccines represented a 30% decrease from the comparable period in 2021, while for the full year it represented only a 4% increase. Profit for the fourth quarter was $1.5bn, and for the full year it was $8.4bn, representing decreases of 70% and 31%, respectively.\n\nFor the full year of 2023, Moderna expects Spikevax to have sales contracted for delivery of $5bn.\n\nModerna's experience is analogous to those of other companies that have relied on pandemic windfalls. In its fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings, Gilead reported a 26.3% decline in sales of its antiviral Veklury (remdesivir) owing to lower rates of infection and hospitalization. (Also see \"Gilead CAR-T Joins Billion-Dollar Club As Biktarvy Sales Cross $10bn Mark\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.) Pfizer also said in its earnings that it expects sales of Comirnaty, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine it markets with BioNTech SE, to decline along with those of its antiviral treatment Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir). (Also see \"From Hallelujah To Headwind: Pfizer's COVID-19 Franchise Hits The Downturn\" - Scrip, 31 Jan, 2023.) Merck issued a similar forecast for its COVID-19 drug, Lagevrio (molnupiravir). (Also see \"Merck & Co. Remains 'Very Confident' In TIGIT\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.)\n\nCompany's Post-Pandemic Future Starts To Take Shape\n\nEarly on, Moderna moved to invest its revenues in pumping up its R&D, and while Bancel pointed to the dozens of programs it now has across a wide variety of disease states, the earnings report showed a diversified commercial-stage biotech company taking shape.\n\nIts likely first commercial product after its COVID-19 vaccines will be another vaccine against another respiratory infection, mRNA-1345 for RSV in older adults, for which Moderna plans regulatory filings in the first half of 2023.\n\n\"The topline results we've seen are incredibly encouraging, and we're grateful to the [US Food and Drug Administration] for [breakthrough therapy designation] for mRNA-1345, which further emphasizes the significant health impact of RSV in older adults and the high unmet need,\" Moderna president Stephen Hoge told the 23 February call.\n\nPhase III results announced in January for mRNA-1345 showed that the vaccine had 83.7% efficacy against RSV lower respiratory tract disease, indicating a rate of efficacy slightly higher than the 82.6% efficacy of GSK plc's vaccine and significantly more than the 66.7% of Pfizer's competitor. However, those were only topline data that make direct comparisons challenging. (Also see \"Phase III Results Show Moderna Could Challenge In Blockbuster RSV Vaccine Market\" - Scrip, 18 Jan, 2023.)\n\nModerna expects a Phase III interim efficacy analysis for mRNA-1010, its flu vaccine, to undergo data safety monitoring board review before the end of the first quarter.\n\nBut the company is making progress outside of respiratory infections as well, particularly in oncology.\n\nOn 22 February, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to mRNA-4157/V940, the mRNA cancer vaccine that Moderna is developing for melanoma under partnership with Merck and combining with the PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in the Phase IIb KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 trial. Data from the trial announced in December showing a 44% lower risk of recurrence or death for combination compared with Keytruda alone led to the breakthrough designation. (Also see \"Moderna Chalks Up Industry Milestone With mRNA Cancer Vaccine Efficacy Success\" - Scrip, 14 Dec, 2022.)\n\nHoge noted on the call that it was the first demonstration of efficacy for an investigational mRNA-based cancer treatment in a randomized trial, and Moderna and Merck plan to start \"multiple late-stage confirmatory studies\" in 2023, starting in melanoma and then moving to non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n\"We are planning to explore additional indications for 4157, where we believe there's a strong biologic rationale for immune-stimulating approaches,\" he said. \"These include early-stage and metastatic settings and will include indications where Keytruda is not yet approved.\"\nSummary: The company stated a fourth quarter downturn in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine sales and guided for sales of $5bn in 2023.

(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)\n\nRaimondo spoke at Georgetown University as she moved on to the next phase of the heady task of handing out about $50 billion in government funds to spur semiconductor manufacturing and research in the years ahead. The money was approved in 2022 when President Biden signed the CHIPs and Science Act into law.\n\nThe speech comes after months of intense lobbying from the semiconductor sector. Companies like Intel (INTC); Micron (MU), IBM (IBM) and even the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) have scored visits from President Biden to tout plans for new U.S. plants in the works-- and they appear well positioned to take large pieces of the coming windfall. Meanwhile, Raimondo and other officials promise that the funds will be spread across the industry among a range of companies of all sizes.\n\n\"Everyone is going to want to know, how much money is Intel getting, how much money is Samsung getting,\" she said during her remarks, promising answers in the weeks ahead. The Commerce Secretary focused her remarks instead on America's national security imperatives and what the semiconductor fabrication plants and research facilities will look like.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel's Vice President of U.S. Government Relations Allen Thompson praised the rollout and this week's focus on building semiconductor ecosystems in a statement to Yahoo Finance calling the law \"the most significant competition policy in our generation.\" He also noted added that his company has already announced $43.5 billion of investments in their U.S. sites since the law's passage.\n\nThe overall ambition is for the U.S. to supplant places like Taiwan, South Korea, and China to become the \"premier destination in the world\" for the sector, Raimondo said. She added during a briefing with reporters that \"every chip company will need to be in the United States of America long after the subsidy runs out because they will have to and want to be here because we will have built that ecosystem.\"\n\n'That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable'\n\nThe Biden administration's challenge: reverse what expert call a downward spiral for the industry in the U.S. in recent decades. American semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% in 1990 to only 12% in recent years, according to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nThe situation is even worse with the world's most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019. But the recent the announcements from companies like Intel for new U.S. plants could grow U.S. manufacturing in the years ahead.\n\nRaimondo noted that, at the moment, the U.S. relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for 92% of our advanced chips. \"That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable,\" she said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signs into law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 in August. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nRaimondo also reached out to semiconductor companies focused on chip design like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA) who had been worried about being left out of the government windfall as the bill was being negotiated.\n\n\"Our success will be short-lived\" if we focus only on manufacturing Raimondo said Thursday, adding that R&D is what will make it a longer term success.\n\n\"It's one thing to get companies here, we need them to stay here,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement to Yahoo Finance, Dario Gil, a senior vice president at IBM, congratulated the administration on the unveiling and added \"as a global leader in semiconductor research and development, IBM stands ready to work with our academic and manufacturing partners to implement new technologies and rapidly scale industrial innovation.\"\n\nThe new law has $39 billion earmarked for semiconductor manufacturers with an additional $11 billion to go to companies as well as universities and others for chip research and design purposes. In addition, the law includes an investment tax credit of up to 25 percent towards a manufacturer's capital expenditures.\n\nReturn on investment? National security.\n\nRaimondo compared the effort to President Lincoln's creation of the land-grant university system, nuclear security in the 1940s, and John F. Kennedy's famous call to put a man on the moon.\n\nShe noted that the 1960s saw an explosion of PhDs in the science and engineering fields to back up Kennedy's 1961 call--and she is hoping for something similar in the years ahead in universities and high schools to create a bigger semiconductor industry workforce.\n\nThe next step in the administration's plan will come next Tuesday when Raimondo's department unveils the formal application that manufacturing companies will need to access the money. \"It's going to be a very comprehensive application, which will be crystal clear about the specific criteria that we'll be looking for and the information we need from companies,\" Raimondo told reporters.\n\nThe speech also nodded to concerns that the billions, once they are signed over, could end going to things like stock buybacks. During her speech, Raimondo promised to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars and said she would will demand transparency from companies. A recent letter from prominent lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called on the administration to be vigilant on the buyback issue, saying it could undermine the national security goals of the program.\n\n\"I expect to be held accountable,\" Raimondo said.\n\nMeanwhile, the race for the money remains well underway with places like Arizona making a play to be one of the manufacturing hubs.\n\nRaimondo said she hopes the $50 billion in government funds will lead to somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 billion in private investment.\n\n\"Get in the boat, row with us to achieve this mission,\" she said during the speech in a comment directed towards private investors around the country. \"I don't want to spend a dime that I don't have to.\"\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or Android\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube\nSummary: The Biden administration is unveiling audacious goals Thursday for how it will seek to get the most bang for the billions it has at its disposal to spur the semiconductor sector in Spain in the years ahead.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

But the messenger RNA-focused biotech's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings also hint that the post-pandemic future that it has been building toward is taking shape as newer mRNA-based products inch closer to the market, particularly in infectious diseases like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and oncology.\n\nModerna announced its earnings on 23 February, reporting fourth quarter revenues of $5.1bn and full year revenues of $19.3bn, nearly all of which - $4.9bn and $18.4bn, respectively - came from global sales of Spikevax.\n\nBut the firm is keen to establish itself as a multi-product company. \"The company continues to expand at a rapid pace,\" CEO Stephane Bancel told Moderna's same-day earnings call. \"We now have three commercial COVID-19 vaccine products. We have four programs in Phase III.\"\n\nHe added that the company is on track to expand its commercial portfolio \"very soon\" and overall has 48 programs underway.\n\n\"Our $18bn of cash balance at the end of the year is enabling us to scale across research, clinical development, manufacturing, commercial and G&A,\" he said.\n\nBigger Drop In Pandemic Sales To Come\n\nAlong with other drug makers that have experienced record revenues and profits from COVID-19 vaccines and drugs - such as Pfizer Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. and Gilead Sciences, Inc. - Moderna has begun to see its sales take a downward trajectory. For the fourth quarter, the sales figure for Spikevax and related bivalent vaccines represented a 30% decrease from the comparable period in 2021, while for the full year it represented only a 4% increase. Profit for the fourth quarter was $1.5bn, and for the full year it was $8.4bn, representing decreases of 70% and 31%, respectively.\n\nFor the full year of 2023, Moderna expects Spikevax to have sales contracted for delivery of $5bn.\n\nModerna's experience is analogous to those of other companies that have relied on pandemic windfalls. In its fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings, Gilead reported a 26.3% decline in sales of its antiviral Veklury (remdesivir) owing to lower rates of infection and hospitalization. (Also see \"Gilead CAR-T Joins Billion-Dollar Club As Biktarvy Sales Cross $10bn Mark\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.) Pfizer also said in its earnings that it expects sales of Comirnaty, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine it markets with BioNTech SE, to decline along with those of its antiviral treatment Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir). (Also see \"From Hallelujah To Headwind: Pfizer's COVID-19 Franchise Hits The Downturn\" - Scrip, 31 Jan, 2023.) Merck issued a similar forecast for its COVID-19 drug, Lagevrio (molnupiravir). (Also see \"Merck & Co. Remains 'Very Confident' In TIGIT\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.)\n\nCompany's Post-Pandemic Future Starts To Take Shape\n\nEarly on, Moderna moved to invest its revenues in pumping up its R&D, and while Bancel pointed to the dozens of programs it now has across a wide variety of disease states, the earnings report showed a diversified commercial-stage biotech company taking shape.\n\nIts likely first commercial product after its COVID-19 vaccines will be another vaccine against another respiratory infection, mRNA-1345 for RSV in older adults, for which Moderna plans regulatory filings in the first half of 2023.\n\n\"The topline results we've seen are incredibly encouraging, and we're grateful to the [US Food and Drug Administration] for [breakthrough therapy designation] for mRNA-1345, which further emphasizes the significant health impact of RSV in older adults and the high unmet need,\" Moderna president Stephen Hoge told the 23 February call.\n\nPhase III results announced in January for mRNA-1345 showed that the vaccine had 83.7% efficacy against RSV lower respiratory tract disease, indicating a rate of efficacy slightly higher than the 82.6% efficacy of GSK plc's vaccine and significantly more than the 66.7% of Pfizer's competitor. However, those were only topline data that make direct comparisons challenging. (Also see \"Phase III Results Show Moderna Could Challenge In Blockbuster RSV Vaccine Market\" - Scrip, 18 Jan, 2023.)\n\nModerna expects a Phase III interim efficacy analysis for mRNA-1010, its flu vaccine, to undergo data safety monitoring board review before the end of the first quarter.\n\nBut the company is making progress outside of respiratory infections as well, particularly in oncology.\n\nOn 22 February, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to mRNA-4157/V940, the mRNA cancer vaccine that Moderna is developing for melanoma under partnership with Merck and combining with the PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in the Phase IIb KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 trial. Data from the trial announced in December showing a 44% lower risk of recurrence or death for combination compared with Keytruda alone led to the breakthrough designation. (Also see \"Moderna Chalks Up Industry Milestone With mRNA Cancer Vaccine Efficacy Success\" - Scrip, 14 Dec, 2022.)\n\nHoge noted on the call that it was the first demonstration of efficacy for an investigational mRNA-based cancer treatment in a randomized trial, and Moderna and Merck plan to start \"multiple late-stage confirmatory studies\" in 2023, starting in melanoma and then moving to non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n\"We are planning to explore additional indications for 4157, where we believe there's a strong biologic rationale for immune-stimulating approaches,\" he said. \"These include early-stage and metastatic settings and will include indications where Keytruda is not yet approved.\"\nSummary: The company reported a fourth quarter decline in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine sales but guided for sales of $10bn in 2023.

Otherwise, they \"will no longer be able to access parliamentary infrastructure or internal digital services.\"\n\nPoilievre has been very active on social media platforms in the last year -- since he announced his intention to run for the party's leadership -- and uses them largely to speak directly to his base through his widely viewed and shared videos.\n\nPoilievre has now scrapped his TikTok account, where he had more than 236,000 followers, entirely.

The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like pea milk, soon will be mandated to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk.

The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like rice milk, soon will not be asked to include a voluntary statement on their labels that compares their nutritional value to dairy milk.

Some people were also robbed.\n\nIt was the third inquest into the tragedy following pressure from the family. A coroner had initially ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died.\n\nSteve Johnson described the police investigation since the third inquest as \"spectacular.\" But he said his brother's homicide could have been solved easily by police when he died.\n\n\"In fact, many of us believe that it was the police indifference to these killings and bashings of gay men back in the '80s that helped cause them. The perpetrators always knew they would not get into trouble,\" Johnson said.\n\nA New South Wales government inquiry began hearing evidence in November of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.\n\nViolence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, an HIV support group, ACON, told the inquiry.\n\nSteve Johnson, a wealthy entrepreneur, offered a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward in 2020 for information about his brother's death, matching a reward already offered by police.\n\nWhite, 52, was arrested in Sydney that year and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Johnson, who was an Australian National University Ph.D. student living in the capital, Canberra, when he died.\n\nPolice have suggested the reward led to the arrest, saying they expected it would be collected after White's conviction.\n\nWhite took his lawyers by surprise in January last year by pleading guilty to murder during a pretrial hearing.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, White signed a statement saying that he had been \"confused\" when he pleaded guilty, had not caused Johnson's death and wanted to plead not guilty.\n\nBut the judge recorded the guilty plea and White was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.\n\nIn sentencing White, the judge said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, which would have led to a longer prison term.\n\nIn November, three judges of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that White should have been allowed to reverse his guilty plea, quashing his conviction and sentence.\n\nWhite on Thursday pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White's lawyers to accept the plea.\n\nPolice Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family's long fight for justice.\n\n\"Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who've been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they've done over many, many years,\" Yeomans said.\n\nThe Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales will report on June 30.\nSummary: An Australian has pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney cliff that was nicknamed as a gay meeting place.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Called gravitational lensing, this natural phenomenon created a deep-field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies. Deep-field observations are long exposures of regions of the sky that can show distant, difficult-to-see objects.\n\nWebb has already captured several deep-field views of the universe since it began scientific observations in July. Gravitational lensing is crucial for astronomers because it can uncover features of the early universe that are otherwise impossible to see.\n\nPrevious images of the central core of Pandora's Cluster came courtesy of the Hubble Space Telescope. Webb's latest observation of the cluster has revealed never-before-seen details in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nAstronomers in the UNCOVER program, or Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization, used Webb's unique Near-Infrared Camera for 30 hours to capture detailed long-exposure images. The latest photo released Wednesday stitches together four of those images into a panorama that includes 50,000 sources of near-infrared light.\n\nHundreds of faint arced lines in the lower-right image are actually distant galaxies that scientists weren't able to spot with Hubble.\n\nThe many dots of light in the new Webb image represent galaxies. Gravitational lensing can distort the appearance of distant galaxies, making them appear different from the galaxies in the foreground of the image -- which is why the distant galaxies resemble arcs of light.\n\nNext, the research team will go through all of the data in the image and pinpoint galaxies that they'd like to study further this summer to gain new insights into the early universe.\nSummary: The James Webb Space Telescope obtained a new image of Pandora's Cluster, a megacluster of galaxies that allowed astronomers to peer into the distant universe and observe never-before-seen details.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Key to managing that growth is FIMS, which will \"enable drones and other low-level operators to safely integrate with existing airspace users\", according to Airservices Australia.\n\nThe system will act as the \"connector\" between UAS and Australia's current airspace management, says Courtney Meares-Whitty, head of the FIMS initiave for Airservices Australia.\n\nGumley says the UTM programme completed field-testing in November of multiple FIMS prototypes developed with private sector partners and is now shifting into the delivery phase - with a target of 2025.\n\nAs it rolls out FIMS over the next three years, the project will also deploy newly developed technologies, including access to improved geospatial data for UAS operators, a surveillance network for tracking drones and a method for the \"detection of non-cooperative drones\".\n\nThe ultimate goal, Gumley says, is to fully-integrate FIMS into the existing air traffic management system for civil aviation - as opposed to a bifurcated or \"segregated\" system in which UAS are managed separately from conventional aircraft.\n\n\"Segregated integration is not a sustainable model for the future,\" he notes.\n\nAirservices Australia says its focus on safely incorporating large numbers of small drones into the existing aviation ecosystem \"will foster growth in the UAS market\".\n\nThe private sector appears to agree with that assessment.\n\n\"UTM solutions are essential,\" says Phillip Swadling, technical director of avionics at Thales. \"The lack of harmonised standards are holding back drone business development,\" he adds.\n\n\"We need practical and pragmatic solutions that facilitate the integration of emerging technologies,\" says Zac Kennedy, chief regulatory officer at Swoop Aero - a Melbourne-based start-up developing networks of commercial UAS to fill gaps in existing logistics systems.\n\nGumley says the goal of the UTM programme is to offer a service that is as frictionless as possible, with \"airspace authorisation measured in seconds, not weeks\" for UAS operators. He notes Airservices Australia is working to deliver automatic airspace approval at all of the country's 29 aerodromes by end of 2023.\n\nUnder an initiative called OneSky Australia, Canberra intends to streamline airspace management even further by combining the civil and military aviation control systems. Airservices Australia and the Department of Defence are jointly developing that infrastructure, known as the Civil Military Air Traffic Management System (CMATS).\n\nGumley says CMATS also will eventually incorporate the launch and recovery of space-bound rockets.\n\nSwadling argues for government to take a more active role in setting a national strategic policy on UAS, which will guide private sector development.\n\n\"There is a need for an integrated and uniform UAS strategy at the national level,\" he says.\nSummary: National air traffic control agency Airservices Australia announces it has moved from prototyping to the implementation stage of an effort to deploy an airspace management tool for small, uncrewed aircraft such as commercial unmanned air vehicles.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Driscoll, the assistant director-in-charge of the FBI's New York field office said Watson \"repeatedly attempted to entice both investors and lenders through a series of deliberate deceptions and fabrications.\"\n\nAuthorities say Watson and his business partners, between 2018 and 2021, attempted to defraud investors and lenders of \"tens of millions of dollars through fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions\" about the company's debts and other key financial information.\n\nOn multiple occasions, the U.S. attorney's office said, Watson and his colleagues pretended to be other media executives to cover up earlier misrepresentations.\nSummary: The founder of the digital start-up in trouble Ozy Media has been arrested on fraud charges as part of a scheme to maintain the financially challenged company.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

But the messenger RNA-focused biotech's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings also hint that the post-pandemic future that it has been building toward is taking shape as newer mRNA-based products inch closer to the market, particularly in infectious diseases like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and oncology.\n\nModerna announced its earnings on 23 February, reporting fourth quarter revenues of $5.1bn and full year revenues of $19.3bn, nearly all of which - $4.9bn and $18.4bn, respectively - came from global sales of Spikevax.\n\nBut the firm is keen to establish itself as a multi-product company. \"The company continues to expand at a rapid pace,\" CEO Stephane Bancel told Moderna's same-day earnings call. \"We now have three commercial COVID-19 vaccine products. We have four programs in Phase III.\"\n\nHe added that the company is on track to expand its commercial portfolio \"very soon\" and overall has 48 programs underway.\n\n\"Our $18bn of cash balance at the end of the year is enabling us to scale across research, clinical development, manufacturing, commercial and G&A,\" he said.\n\nBigger Drop In Pandemic Sales To Come\n\nAlong with other drug makers that have experienced record revenues and profits from COVID-19 vaccines and drugs - such as Pfizer Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. and Gilead Sciences, Inc. - Moderna has begun to see its sales take a downward trajectory. For the fourth quarter, the sales figure for Spikevax and related bivalent vaccines represented a 30% decrease from the comparable period in 2021, while for the full year it represented only a 4% increase. Profit for the fourth quarter was $1.5bn, and for the full year it was $8.4bn, representing decreases of 70% and 31%, respectively.\n\nFor the full year of 2023, Moderna expects Spikevax to have sales contracted for delivery of $5bn.\n\nModerna's experience is analogous to those of other companies that have relied on pandemic windfalls. In its fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings, Gilead reported a 26.3% decline in sales of its antiviral Veklury (remdesivir) owing to lower rates of infection and hospitalization. (Also see \"Gilead CAR-T Joins Billion-Dollar Club As Biktarvy Sales Cross $10bn Mark\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.) Pfizer also said in its earnings that it expects sales of Comirnaty, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine it markets with BioNTech SE, to decline along with those of its antiviral treatment Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir). (Also see \"From Hallelujah To Headwind: Pfizer's COVID-19 Franchise Hits The Downturn\" - Scrip, 31 Jan, 2023.) Merck issued a similar forecast for its COVID-19 drug, Lagevrio (molnupiravir). (Also see \"Merck & Co. Remains 'Very Confident' In TIGIT\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.)\n\nCompany's Post-Pandemic Future Starts To Take Shape\n\nEarly on, Moderna moved to invest its revenues in pumping up its R&D, and while Bancel pointed to the dozens of programs it now has across a wide variety of disease states, the earnings report showed a diversified commercial-stage biotech company taking shape.\n\nIts likely first commercial product after its COVID-19 vaccines will be another vaccine against another respiratory infection, mRNA-1345 for RSV in older adults, for which Moderna plans regulatory filings in the first half of 2023.\n\n\"The topline results we've seen are incredibly encouraging, and we're grateful to the [US Food and Drug Administration] for [breakthrough therapy designation] for mRNA-1345, which further emphasizes the significant health impact of RSV in older adults and the high unmet need,\" Moderna president Stephen Hoge told the 23 February call.\n\nPhase III results announced in January for mRNA-1345 showed that the vaccine had 83.7% efficacy against RSV lower respiratory tract disease, indicating a rate of efficacy slightly higher than the 82.6% efficacy of GSK plc's vaccine and significantly more than the 66.7% of Pfizer's competitor. However, those were only topline data that make direct comparisons challenging. (Also see \"Phase III Results Show Moderna Could Challenge In Blockbuster RSV Vaccine Market\" - Scrip, 18 Jan, 2023.)\n\nModerna expects a Phase III interim efficacy analysis for mRNA-1010, its flu vaccine, to undergo data safety monitoring board review before the end of the first quarter.\n\nBut the company is making progress outside of respiratory infections as well, particularly in oncology.\n\nOn 22 February, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to mRNA-4157/V940, the mRNA cancer vaccine that Moderna is developing for melanoma under partnership with Merck and combining with the PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in the Phase IIb KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 trial. Data from the trial announced in December showing a 44% lower risk of recurrence or death for combination compared with Keytruda alone led to the breakthrough designation. (Also see \"Moderna Chalks Up Industry Milestone With mRNA Cancer Vaccine Efficacy Success\" - Scrip, 14 Dec, 2022.)\n\nHoge noted on the call that it was the first demonstration of efficacy for an investigational mRNA-based cancer treatment in a randomized trial, and Moderna and Merck plan to start \"multiple late-stage confirmatory studies\" in 2023, starting in melanoma and then moving to non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n\"We are planning to explore additional indications for 4157, where we believe there's a strong biologic rationale for immune-stimulating approaches,\" he said. \"These include early-stage and metastatic settings and will include indications where Keytruda is not yet approved.\"\nSummary: The company informed a fourth quarter drop in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine sales and projected for sales of $5bn in 2023.

An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday, Feb. 23, 2023, to the manslaughter of an American Scott Johnson, who fell to his death 35 years ago from a Sydney cliff top that was known as a gay meeting place. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, File)\n\nCANBERRA - An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay meeting place, with the victim's family welcoming the turning point in their long campaign for justice.\n\nScott White's admission in the New South Wales state Supreme Court came three months after he had his conviction on charges of murdering Scott Johnson overturned by an appeals court.\n\nThe family of Los Angeles-born Johnson had fought for years to overturn an initial finding that the 27-year-old mathematician had taken his own life in 1988.\n\nJohnson's Boston-based older brother, Steve Johnson, told reporters that the proceedings Thursday \"might be the most emotional moment yet.\" He watched the Sydney court hearing online from the United States.\n\nBreakthrough evidence came last October when police intercepted a prison phone call between White and a niece in which he confessed to striking his victim at the clifftop, Johnson said.\n\n\"In that phone call to the niece, he corroborated evidence that they (police) had previously gathered, and that brought his defense team to the table\" to negotiate a guilty plea, Johnson told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The police work that continued during the appeal and after the appeal to get that one last piece of evidence that brought him to the table ... so that we could negotiate this, I'm incredibly thankful,\" he said.\n\nJohnson said he has read the facts of the crime agreed between prosecutors and defense lawyers as part of a plea deal that will be presented to a judge when White returns to court on June 6 to be sentenced.\n\n\"Reading the black and white of his confession, in which he states that he threw the first punch, which I imagine was the only punch and my brother must have been very close to the cliff ... makes me pretty angry,\" Johnson said.\n\nA coroner ruled in 2017 that Scott Johnson \"fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence\" by unknown assailants who \"attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.\"\n\nThe coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some people were also robbed.\n\nIt was the third inquest into the tragedy following pressure from the family. A coroner had initially ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died.\n\nSteve Johnson described the police investigation since the third inquest as \"spectacular.\" But he said his brother's homicide could have been solved easily by police when he died.\n\n\"In fact, many of us believe that it was the police indifference to these killings and bashings of gay men back in the '80s that helped cause them. The perpetrators always knew they would not get into trouble,\" Johnson said.\n\nA New South Wales government inquiry began hearing evidence in November of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.\n\nViolence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, an HIV support group, ACON, told the inquiry.\n\nSteve Johnson, a wealthy entrepreneur, offered a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward in 2020 for information about his brother's death, matching a reward already offered by police.\n\nWhite, 52, was arrested in Sydney that year and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Johnson, who was an Australian National University Ph.D. student living in the capital, Canberra, when he died.\n\nPolice have suggested the reward led to the arrest, saying they expected it would be collected after White's conviction.\n\nWhite took his lawyers by surprise in January last year by pleading guilty to murder during a pretrial hearing.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, White signed a statement saying that he had been \"confused\" when he pleaded guilty, had not caused Johnson's death and wanted to plead not guilty.\n\nBut the judge recorded the guilty plea and White was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.\n\nIn sentencing White, the judge said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, which would have led to a longer prison term.\n\nIn November, three judges of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that White should have been allowed to reverse his guilty plea, quashing his conviction and sentence.\n\nWhite on Thursday pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White's lawyers to accept the plea.\n\nPolice Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family's long fight for justice.\n\n\"Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who've been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they've done over many, many years,\" Yeomans said.\n\nThe Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales will report on June 30.\nSummary: An Australian has pled not guilty to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney landmark that was known as a gay meeting place.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

(Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File)\n\nNEW YORK - The founder of the troubled digital start-up Ozy Media was arrested Thursday on fraud charges as part of a scheme to prop up the financially struggling company, which hemorrhaged millions of dollars before it shut down amid revelations of possibly deceptive business practices.\n\nThe arrest of Carlos Watson at a Manhattan hotel came after two of the company's top executives pleaded guilty this month to fraud charges, including Ozy's then-chief operating officer, Samir Rao, who allegedly impersonated a YouTube executive during a pitch to Goldman Sachs, a potential investor.\n\nThe guilty pleas were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe indictment accuses Watson of conspiring to commit securities fraud and wire fraud, as well as identity theft for his role in the impersonation of several media executives.\n\n\"We are really disappointed,\" Watson's attorney, Lanny Breuer, told the Journal after the arrest. \"We have been acting in good faith and believe we had a constructive dialogue with the government and are shocked by the actions this morning.\"\n\nScrutiny over the company deepened after the New York Times reported in October 2021 that an Ozy official had masqueraded as a YouTube executive in a failing attempt to get Goldman Sachs to infuse money into the struggling enterprise.\n\nShortly after, Ozy said it was shutting down.\n\n\"As alleged, Carlos Watson is a con man whose business strategy was based on outright deceit and fraud,\" said Breon Peace, the U.S. Attorney for the Brooklyn-based Eastern District of New York. \"He ran Ozy as a criminal organization rather than as a reputable media company.\"\n\nMichael J. Driscoll, the assistant director-in-charge of the FBI's New York field office said Watson \"repeatedly attempted to entice both investors and lenders through a series of deliberate deceptions and fabrications.\"\n\nAuthorities say Watson and his business partners, between 2018 and 2021, attempted to defraud investors and lenders of \"tens of millions of dollars through fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions\" about the company's debts and other key financial information.\n\nOn multiple occasions, the U.S. attorney's office said, Watson and his colleagues pretended to be other media executives to cover up earlier misrepresentations.\nSummary: The CEO of the troubled digital start-up Ozy Media has been arrested on fraud charges as part of a scheme to prop up the financially struggling company.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Key to managing that growth is FIMS, which will \"enable drones and other low-level operators to safely integrate with existing airspace users\", according to Airservices Australia.\n\nThe system will act as the \"connector\" between UAS and Australia's current airspace management, says Courtney Meares-Whitty, head of the FIMS initiave for Airservices Australia.\n\nGumley says the UTM programme completed field-testing in November of multiple FIMS prototypes developed with private sector partners and is now shifting into the delivery phase - with a target of 2025.\n\nAs it rolls out FIMS over the next three years, the project will also deploy newly developed technologies, including access to improved geospatial data for UAS operators, a surveillance network for tracking drones and a method for the \"detection of non-cooperative drones\".\n\nThe ultimate goal, Gumley says, is to fully-integrate FIMS into the existing air traffic management system for civil aviation - as opposed to a bifurcated or \"segregated\" system in which UAS are managed separately from conventional aircraft.\n\n\"Segregated integration is not a sustainable model for the future,\" he notes.\n\nAirservices Australia says its focus on safely incorporating large numbers of small drones into the existing aviation ecosystem \"will foster growth in the UAS market\".\n\nThe private sector appears to agree with that assessment.\n\n\"UTM solutions are essential,\" says Phillip Swadling, technical director of avionics at Thales. \"The lack of harmonised standards are holding back drone business development,\" he adds.\n\n\"We need practical and pragmatic solutions that facilitate the integration of emerging technologies,\" says Zac Kennedy, chief regulatory officer at Swoop Aero - a Melbourne-based start-up developing networks of commercial UAS to fill gaps in existing logistics systems.\n\nGumley says the goal of the UTM programme is to offer a service that is as frictionless as possible, with \"airspace authorisation measured in seconds, not weeks\" for UAS operators. He notes Airservices Australia is working to deliver automatic airspace approval at all of the country's 29 aerodromes by end of 2023.\n\nUnder an initiative called OneSky Australia, Canberra intends to streamline airspace management even further by combining the civil and military aviation control systems. Airservices Australia and the Department of Defence are jointly developing that infrastructure, known as the Civil Military Air Traffic Management System (CMATS).\n\nGumley says CMATS also will eventually incorporate the launch and recovery of space-bound rockets.\n\nSwadling argues for government to take a more active role in setting a national strategic policy on UAS, which will guide private sector development.\n\n\"There is a need for an integrated and uniform UAS strategy at the national level,\" he says.\nSummary: National air traffic management organization Airservices Australia claims that it has moved from prototyping to the delivery phase of an effort to deploy an airspace management tool for small, unmanned aircraft such as commercial aerial vehicles.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

But the messenger RNA-focused biotech's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings also hint that the post-pandemic future that it has been building toward is taking shape as newer mRNA-based products inch closer to the market, particularly in infectious diseases like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and oncology.\n\nModerna announced its earnings on 23 February, reporting fourth quarter revenues of $5.1bn and full year revenues of $19.3bn, nearly all of which - $4.9bn and $18.4bn, respectively - came from global sales of Spikevax.\n\nBut the firm is keen to establish itself as a multi-product company. \"The company continues to expand at a rapid pace,\" CEO Stephane Bancel told Moderna's same-day earnings call. \"We now have three commercial COVID-19 vaccine products. We have four programs in Phase III.\"\n\nHe added that the company is on track to expand its commercial portfolio \"very soon\" and overall has 48 programs underway.\n\n\"Our $18bn of cash balance at the end of the year is enabling us to scale across research, clinical development, manufacturing, commercial and G&A,\" he said.\n\nBigger Drop In Pandemic Sales To Come\n\nAlong with other drug makers that have experienced record revenues and profits from COVID-19 vaccines and drugs - such as Pfizer Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. and Gilead Sciences, Inc. - Moderna has begun to see its sales take a downward trajectory. For the fourth quarter, the sales figure for Spikevax and related bivalent vaccines represented a 30% decrease from the comparable period in 2021, while for the full year it represented only a 4% increase. Profit for the fourth quarter was $1.5bn, and for the full year it was $8.4bn, representing decreases of 70% and 31%, respectively.\n\nFor the full year of 2023, Moderna expects Spikevax to have sales contracted for delivery of $5bn.\n\nModerna's experience is analogous to those of other companies that have relied on pandemic windfalls. In its fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings, Gilead reported a 26.3% decline in sales of its antiviral Veklury (remdesivir) owing to lower rates of infection and hospitalization. (Also see \"Gilead CAR-T Joins Billion-Dollar Club As Biktarvy Sales Cross $10bn Mark\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.) Pfizer also said in its earnings that it expects sales of Comirnaty, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine it markets with BioNTech SE, to decline along with those of its antiviral treatment Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir). (Also see \"From Hallelujah To Headwind: Pfizer's COVID-19 Franchise Hits The Downturn\" - Scrip, 31 Jan, 2023.) Merck issued a similar forecast for its COVID-19 drug, Lagevrio (molnupiravir). (Also see \"Merck & Co. Remains 'Very Confident' In TIGIT\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.)\n\nCompany's Post-Pandemic Future Starts To Take Shape\n\nEarly on, Moderna moved to invest its revenues in pumping up its R&D, and while Bancel pointed to the dozens of programs it now has across a wide variety of disease states, the earnings report showed a diversified commercial-stage biotech company taking shape.\n\nIts likely first commercial product after its COVID-19 vaccines will be another vaccine against another respiratory infection, mRNA-1345 for RSV in older adults, for which Moderna plans regulatory filings in the first half of 2023.\n\n\"The topline results we've seen are incredibly encouraging, and we're grateful to the [US Food and Drug Administration] for [breakthrough therapy designation] for mRNA-1345, which further emphasizes the significant health impact of RSV in older adults and the high unmet need,\" Moderna president Stephen Hoge told the 23 February call.\n\nPhase III results announced in January for mRNA-1345 showed that the vaccine had 83.7% efficacy against RSV lower respiratory tract disease, indicating a rate of efficacy slightly higher than the 82.6% efficacy of GSK plc's vaccine and significantly more than the 66.7% of Pfizer's competitor. However, those were only topline data that make direct comparisons challenging. (Also see \"Phase III Results Show Moderna Could Challenge In Blockbuster RSV Vaccine Market\" - Scrip, 18 Jan, 2023.)\n\nModerna expects a Phase III interim efficacy analysis for mRNA-1010, its flu vaccine, to undergo data safety monitoring board review before the end of the first quarter.\n\nBut the company is making progress outside of respiratory infections as well, particularly in oncology.\n\nOn 22 February, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to mRNA-4157/V940, the mRNA cancer vaccine that Moderna is developing for melanoma under partnership with Merck and combining with the PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in the Phase IIb KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 trial. Data from the trial announced in December showing a 44% lower risk of recurrence or death for combination compared with Keytruda alone led to the breakthrough designation. (Also see \"Moderna Chalks Up Industry Milestone With mRNA Cancer Vaccine Efficacy Success\" - Scrip, 14 Dec, 2022.)\n\nHoge noted on the call that it was the first demonstration of efficacy for an investigational mRNA-based cancer treatment in a randomized trial, and Moderna and Merck plan to start \"multiple late-stage confirmatory studies\" in 2023, starting in melanoma and then moving to non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n\"We are planning to explore additional indications for 4157, where we believe there's a strong biologic rationale for immune-stimulating approaches,\" he said. \"These include early-stage and metastatic settings and will include indications where Keytruda is not yet approved.\"\nSummary: The company noted a fourth quarter decline in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine sales and expected sales of $5bn by 2023.

(AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, File)\n\nCANBERRA - An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay meeting place, with the victim's family welcoming the turning point in their long campaign for justice.\n\nScott White's admission in the New South Wales state Supreme Court came three months after he had his conviction on charges of murdering Scott Johnson overturned by an appeals court.\n\nThe family of Los Angeles-born Johnson had fought for years to overturn an initial finding that the 27-year-old mathematician had taken his own life in 1988.\n\nJohnson's Boston-based older brother, Steve Johnson, told reporters that the proceedings Thursday \"might be the most emotional moment yet.\" He watched the Sydney court hearing online from the United States.\n\nBreakthrough evidence came last October when police intercepted a prison phone call between White and a niece in which he confessed to striking his victim at the clifftop, Johnson said.\n\n\"In that phone call to the niece, he corroborated evidence that they (police) had previously gathered, and that brought his defense team to the table\" to negotiate a guilty plea, Johnson told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The police work that continued during the appeal and after the appeal to get that one last piece of evidence that brought him to the table ... so that we could negotiate this, I'm incredibly thankful,\" he said.\n\nJohnson said he has read the facts of the crime agreed between prosecutors and defense lawyers as part of a plea deal that will be presented to a judge when White returns to court on June 6 to be sentenced.\n\n\"Reading the black and white of his confession, in which he states that he threw the first punch, which I imagine was the only punch and my brother must have been very close to the cliff ... makes me pretty angry,\" Johnson said.\n\nA coroner ruled in 2017 that Scott Johnson \"fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence\" by unknown assailants who \"attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.\"\n\nThe coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some people were also robbed.\n\nIt was the third inquest into the tragedy following pressure from the family. A coroner had initially ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died.\n\nSteve Johnson described the police investigation since the third inquest as \"spectacular.\" But he said his brother's homicide could have been solved easily by police when he died.\n\n\"In fact, many of us believe that it was the police indifference to these killings and bashings of gay men back in the '80s that helped cause them. The perpetrators always knew they would not get into trouble,\" Johnson said.\n\nA New South Wales government inquiry began hearing evidence in November of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.\n\nViolence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, an HIV support group, ACON, told the inquiry.\n\nSteve Johnson, a wealthy entrepreneur, offered a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward in 2020 for information about his brother's death, matching a reward already offered by police.\n\nWhite, 52, was arrested in Sydney that year and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Johnson, who was an Australian National University Ph.D. student living in the capital, Canberra, when he died.\n\nPolice have suggested the reward led to the arrest, saying they expected it would be collected after White's conviction.\n\nWhite took his lawyers by surprise in January last year by pleading guilty to murder during a pretrial hearing.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, White signed a statement saying that he had been \"confused\" when he pleaded guilty, had not caused Johnson's death and wanted to plead not guilty.\n\nBut the judge recorded the guilty plea and White was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.\n\nIn sentencing White, the judge said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, which would have led to a longer prison term.\n\nIn November, three judges of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that White should have been allowed to reverse his guilty plea, quashing his conviction and sentence.\n\nWhite on Thursday pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White's lawyers to accept the plea.\n\nPolice Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family's long fight for justice.\n\n\"Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who've been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they've done over many, many years,\" Yeomans said.\n\nThe Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales will report on June 30.\nSummary: An Australian has pled not guilty to manslaughter in the death 36 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay meeting place.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Get news about destinations opening, inspiration for future adventures, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.\n\nCNN --\n\nFor years, journey times flying east from Israel depended on who you were flying with.\n\nIf you were boarding a flight operated by Israeli airlines, including national carrier El Al, your flight would take around two hours more than if you were flying with another airline.\n\nThe reason? Israeli airlines were banned from the airspace of both Oman and Saudi Arabia. That meant flights to India and Southeast Asia, which would naturally head east from Israel, had to dip south, crossing over Jordan and following the Red Sea down to the bottom of the Arabian Peninsula, before hooking northeast.\n\nNow, all that is set to change. Following the Saudi government's announcement in July 2022 that the country's airspace would open up to all carriers, Oman has followed suit.\n\nEl Al has posted a map of their current and new routes to Southeast Asia From El Al Israel\n\nOn February 23, the Civil Aviation Authority of Oman announced that it will open its airspace to \"all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflying\" - effectively ending the ban on El Al, Israir and Arkia, Israel's three airlines.\n\nIn a tweet, it said the move was \"part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfil its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, which stipulates non-discrimination between civil aircrafts used in international air navigation.\"\n\nThe move could cut Israeli carriers' flight times to Asia by up to three hours, Jonathan Sivarajah, an El Al frequent flier and Israeli aviation commentator, told CNN.\n\nAs part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfill its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, the Civil Aviation Authority affirms that the Sultanate's airspace is open for all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflyuing. pic.twitter.com/jNaqqDxZM1 -- hyy'@ lTWyrn lmdny (@CAAOMN) February 23, 2023\n\nHe added that it \"opens up further opportunities [for the airlines], not only to Asia but potentially to Australia, too.\"\n\nEl Al's nonstop flight from Tel Aviv to Bangkok is currently listed as taking 10 hours 45 minutes. But a nonstop flight on Royal Jordanian from Amman - 100 miles east of Tel Aviv - takes eight hours 10 minutes. In fact, flying Tel Aviv to Amman, and then on to Bangkok can be quicker, even including transfer time at the airport - a connecting flight can take as little as nine hours 55 minutes on Royal Jordanian.\n\nWhen the airline was banned from Saudi airspace, El Al flights from Tel Aviv to Mumbai took seven hours 45 minutes. That flight time was then slashed to five hours 15 minutes, before the route was put on hold.\n\nAs the announcement was made, El Al swiftly posted a map of their old and new routes to Southeast Asia on Instagram.\n\nSivarajah said that until now, competing international carriers have \"flooded\" Israel with quicker flights than what the country's own airlines were able to provide.\n\n\"Tel Aviv-bound foreign carriers such as Air India could operate over territory which El Al couldn't. There was a significant fare difference because of the routing in favor of the likes of Air India,\" he said.\n\n\"It wasn't until the Abraham Accords [of 2020] and the Saudi approval that it became partly possible for Israeli carriers to compete. The last stumbling block was Oman.\"\n\nHe expects the new routings to start \"within the next few days.\"\n\nIn a statement, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it \"a day of great news for Israeli aviation.\"\n\nHe added: \"The Far East is not so far away and the skies are no longer the limit.\n\n\"We have worked to open the airspace, first over Saudi Arabia, and from 2018 when I visited Oman, to add Oman as well, so that we can fly directly to India and on to Australia. This was achieved today, after considerable effort, including in recent months. Here is good news - Israel is opening up to the east on an unprecedented scale.\"\n\nIsrael's Foreign Minister Eli Cohen also released a statement, calling the news \"a historic decision that will shorten the road to Asia, lower costs for Israeli citizens and help Israeli airlines to be more competitive.\" He personally thanked the sultan of Oman, Haitham bin Tariq al-Said, for his \"substantial help\" in the process.\n\nThe announcement came after months of talks between the two countries.\n\nIt also follows an announcement earlier this month that El Al would start a frequent flier partnership with UAE carrier Etihad Airways. Frequent fliers can now collect and spend air miles across both airlines. The two had started codesharing on flights in 2021.\n\nLast year, El Al said that a route from Tel Aviv to Melbourne, Australia, was in the works.\nSummary: Oman is unlocking its airspace for Israeli airlines, including El Al.

But the messenger RNA-focused biotech's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings also hint that the post-pandemic future that it has been building toward is taking shape as newer mRNA-based products inch closer to the market, particularly in infectious diseases like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and oncology.\n\nModerna announced its earnings on 23 February, reporting fourth quarter revenues of $5.1bn and full year revenues of $19.3bn, nearly all of which - $4.9bn and $18.4bn, respectively - came from global sales of Spikevax.\n\nBut the firm is keen to establish itself as a multi-product company. \"The company continues to expand at a rapid pace,\" CEO Stephane Bancel told Moderna's same-day earnings call. \"We now have three commercial COVID-19 vaccine products. We have four programs in Phase III.\"\n\nHe added that the company is on track to expand its commercial portfolio \"very soon\" and overall has 48 programs underway.\n\n\"Our $18bn of cash balance at the end of the year is enabling us to scale across research, clinical development, manufacturing, commercial and G&A,\" he said.\n\nBigger Drop In Pandemic Sales To Come\n\nAlong with other drug makers that have experienced record revenues and profits from COVID-19 vaccines and drugs - such as Pfizer Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. and Gilead Sciences, Inc. - Moderna has begun to see its sales take a downward trajectory. For the fourth quarter, the sales figure for Spikevax and related bivalent vaccines represented a 30% decrease from the comparable period in 2021, while for the full year it represented only a 4% increase. Profit for the fourth quarter was $1.5bn, and for the full year it was $8.4bn, representing decreases of 70% and 31%, respectively.\n\nFor the full year of 2023, Moderna expects Spikevax to have sales contracted for delivery of $5bn.\n\nModerna's experience is analogous to those of other companies that have relied on pandemic windfalls. In its fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings, Gilead reported a 26.3% decline in sales of its antiviral Veklury (remdesivir) owing to lower rates of infection and hospitalization. (Also see \"Gilead CAR-T Joins Billion-Dollar Club As Biktarvy Sales Cross $10bn Mark\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.) Pfizer also said in its earnings that it expects sales of Comirnaty, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine it markets with BioNTech SE, to decline along with those of its antiviral treatment Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir). (Also see \"From Hallelujah To Headwind: Pfizer's COVID-19 Franchise Hits The Downturn\" - Scrip, 31 Jan, 2023.) Merck issued a similar forecast for its COVID-19 drug, Lagevrio (molnupiravir). (Also see \"Merck & Co. Remains 'Very Confident' In TIGIT\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.)\n\nCompany's Post-Pandemic Future Starts To Take Shape\n\nEarly on, Moderna moved to invest its revenues in pumping up its R&D, and while Bancel pointed to the dozens of programs it now has across a wide variety of disease states, the earnings report showed a diversified commercial-stage biotech company taking shape.\n\nIts likely first commercial product after its COVID-19 vaccines will be another vaccine against another respiratory infection, mRNA-1345 for RSV in older adults, for which Moderna plans regulatory filings in the first half of 2023.\n\n\"The topline results we've seen are incredibly encouraging, and we're grateful to the [US Food and Drug Administration] for [breakthrough therapy designation] for mRNA-1345, which further emphasizes the significant health impact of RSV in older adults and the high unmet need,\" Moderna president Stephen Hoge told the 23 February call.\n\nPhase III results announced in January for mRNA-1345 showed that the vaccine had 83.7% efficacy against RSV lower respiratory tract disease, indicating a rate of efficacy slightly higher than the 82.6% efficacy of GSK plc's vaccine and significantly more than the 66.7% of Pfizer's competitor. However, those were only topline data that make direct comparisons challenging. (Also see \"Phase III Results Show Moderna Could Challenge In Blockbuster RSV Vaccine Market\" - Scrip, 18 Jan, 2023.)\n\nModerna expects a Phase III interim efficacy analysis for mRNA-1010, its flu vaccine, to undergo data safety monitoring board review before the end of the first quarter.\n\nBut the company is making progress outside of respiratory infections as well, particularly in oncology.\n\nOn 22 February, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to mRNA-4157/V940, the mRNA cancer vaccine that Moderna is developing for melanoma under partnership with Merck and combining with the PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in the Phase IIb KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 trial. Data from the trial announced in December showing a 44% lower risk of recurrence or death for combination compared with Keytruda alone led to the breakthrough designation. (Also see \"Moderna Chalks Up Industry Milestone With mRNA Cancer Vaccine Efficacy Success\" - Scrip, 14 Dec, 2022.)\n\nHoge noted on the call that it was the first demonstration of efficacy for an investigational mRNA-based cancer treatment in a randomized trial, and Moderna and Merck plan to start \"multiple late-stage confirmatory studies\" in 2023, starting in melanoma and then moving to non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n\"We are planning to explore additional indications for 4157, where we believe there's a strong biologic rationale for immune-stimulating approaches,\" he said. \"These include early-stage and metastatic settings and will include indications where Keytruda is not yet approved.\"\nSummary: The company announced a fourth quarter drop in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine sales and guided sales of $5bn by 2023.

(AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, File)\n\nCANBERRA - An Australian pleaded guilty on Thursday to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay meeting place, with the victim's family welcoming the turning point in their long campaign for justice.\n\nScott White's admission in the New South Wales state Supreme Court came three months after he had his conviction on charges of murdering Scott Johnson overturned by an appeals court.\n\nThe family of Los Angeles-born Johnson had fought for years to overturn an initial finding that the 27-year-old mathematician had taken his own life in 1988.\n\nJohnson's Boston-based older brother, Steve Johnson, told reporters that the proceedings Thursday \"might be the most emotional moment yet.\" He watched the Sydney court hearing online from the United States.\n\nBreakthrough evidence came last October when police intercepted a prison phone call between White and a niece in which he confessed to striking his victim at the clifftop, Johnson said.\n\n\"In that phone call to the niece, he corroborated evidence that they (police) had previously gathered, and that brought his defense team to the table\" to negotiate a guilty plea, Johnson told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The police work that continued during the appeal and after the appeal to get that one last piece of evidence that brought him to the table ... so that we could negotiate this, I'm incredibly thankful,\" he said.\n\nJohnson said he has read the facts of the crime agreed between prosecutors and defense lawyers as part of a plea deal that will be presented to a judge when White returns to court on June 6 to be sentenced.\n\n\"Reading the black and white of his confession, in which he states that he threw the first punch, which I imagine was the only punch and my brother must have been very close to the cliff ... makes me pretty angry,\" Johnson said.\n\nA coroner ruled in 2017 that Scott Johnson \"fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence\" by unknown assailants who \"attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.\"\n\nThe coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some people were also robbed.\n\nIt was the third inquest into the tragedy following pressure from the family. A coroner had initially ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died.\n\nSteve Johnson described the police investigation since the third inquest as \"spectacular.\" But he said his brother's homicide could have been solved easily by police when he died.\n\n\"In fact, many of us believe that it was the police indifference to these killings and bashings of gay men back in the '80s that helped cause them. The perpetrators always knew they would not get into trouble,\" Johnson said.\n\nA New South Wales government inquiry began hearing evidence in November of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.\n\nViolence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, an HIV support group, ACON, told the inquiry.\n\nSteve Johnson, a wealthy entrepreneur, offered a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward in 2020 for information about his brother's death, matching a reward already offered by police.\n\nWhite, 52, was arrested in Sydney that year and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Johnson, who was an Australian National University Ph.D. student living in the capital, Canberra, when he died.\n\nPolice have suggested the reward led to the arrest, saying they expected it would be collected after White's conviction.\n\nWhite took his lawyers by surprise in January last year by pleading guilty to murder during a pretrial hearing.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, White signed a statement saying that he had been \"confused\" when he pleaded guilty, had not caused Johnson's death and wanted to plead not guilty.\n\nBut the judge recorded the guilty plea and White was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.\n\nIn sentencing White, the judge said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, which would have led to a longer prison term.\n\nIn November, three judges of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that White should have been allowed to reverse his guilty plea, quashing his conviction and sentence.\n\nWhite on Thursday pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White's lawyers to accept the plea.\n\nPolice Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family's long fight for justice.\n\n\"Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who've been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they've done over many, many years,\" Yeomans said.\n\nThe Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales will report on June 30.\nSummary: An Australian has pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the death 35 years ago of an American who plummeted from a Sydney clifftop that was described as a gay rendezvous point.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

In the U.S. the app got banned in December for all federal government devices - due to concerns that the app may be spying. TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, is based in China. Also, TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew is expected to testify before the U.S. Congress on March 23 - the topic of discussion: potential risks that TikTok could be to U.S. national security.\n\nTikTok is in trouble. Or so it seems (the understatement of the year!). Across the U.S. and the European Union, the crazy-popular short video-sharing platform is facing scrutiny and mistrust. And now, Politico reports that European Commission staff is banned from using TikTok over security concerns.Allegedly, there are ties between Chinese tech companies and the Chinese Communist Party, and the West is getting alarmed. Also, people are getting more and more concerned with the possibility that TikTok collects info from all over the world.An unnamed official told the folks at Politico that EU staff was ordered to remove TikTok from their official devices and that the app should be removed from their personal devices as well if they happen to have work-related apps on said devices (or they can delete work-related apps from their personal devices and leave TikTok).EC employees received the information in an email sent on Thursday morning. Employees have until March 15 to remove the video-sharing app. After that deadline passes, devices with the app installed will be considered non-compliant, which was also underlined in the email.The European Union Council and Parliament are likely to follow with a similar ban, but it may take more time for the Parliament to implement such a policy.\nSummary: Employees of the EU Council are now forced to delete TikTok from their work devices, and keep it on their personal devices too if they have work-related apps installed.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)\n\nRaimondo spoke at Georgetown University as she moved on to the next phase of the heady task of handing out about $50 billion in government funds to spur semiconductor manufacturing and research in the years ahead. The money was approved in 2022 when President Biden signed the CHIPs and Science Act into law.\n\nThe speech comes after months of intense lobbying from the semiconductor sector. Companies like Intel (INTC); Micron (MU), IBM (IBM) and even the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) have scored visits from President Biden to tout plans for new U.S. plants in the works-- and they appear well positioned to take large pieces of the coming windfall. Meanwhile, Raimondo and other officials promise that the funds will be spread across the industry among a range of companies of all sizes.\n\n\"Everyone is going to want to know, how much money is Intel getting, how much money is Samsung getting,\" she said during her remarks, promising answers in the weeks ahead. The Commerce Secretary focused her remarks instead on America's national security imperatives and what the semiconductor fabrication plants and research facilities will look like.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel's Vice President of U.S. Government Relations Allen Thompson praised the rollout and this week's focus on building semiconductor ecosystems in a statement to Yahoo Finance calling the law \"the most significant competition policy in our generation.\" He also noted added that his company has already announced $43.5 billion of investments in their U.S. sites since the law's passage.\n\nThe overall ambition is for the U.S. to supplant places like Taiwan, South Korea, and China to become the \"premier destination in the world\" for the sector, Raimondo said. She added during a briefing with reporters that \"every chip company will need to be in the United States of America long after the subsidy runs out because they will have to and want to be here because we will have built that ecosystem.\"\n\n'That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable'\n\nThe Biden administration's challenge: reverse what expert call a downward spiral for the industry in the U.S. in recent decades. American semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% in 1990 to only 12% in recent years, according to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nThe situation is even worse with the world's most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019. But the recent the announcements from companies like Intel for new U.S. plants could grow U.S. manufacturing in the years ahead.\n\nRaimondo noted that, at the moment, the U.S. relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for 92% of our advanced chips. \"That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable,\" she said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signs into law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 in August. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nRaimondo also reached out to semiconductor companies focused on chip design like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA) who had been worried about being left out of the government windfall as the bill was being negotiated.\n\n\"Our success will be short-lived\" if we focus only on manufacturing Raimondo said Thursday, adding that R&D is what will make it a longer term success.\n\n\"It's one thing to get companies here, we need them to stay here,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement to Yahoo Finance, Dario Gil, a senior vice president at IBM, congratulated the administration on the unveiling and added \"as a global leader in semiconductor research and development, IBM stands ready to work with our academic and manufacturing partners to implement new technologies and rapidly scale industrial innovation.\"\n\nThe new law has $39 billion earmarked for semiconductor manufacturers with an additional $11 billion to go to companies as well as universities and others for chip research and design purposes. In addition, the law includes an investment tax credit of up to 25 percent towards a manufacturer's capital expenditures.\n\nReturn on investment? National security.\n\nRaimondo compared the effort to President Lincoln's creation of the land-grant university system, nuclear security in the 1940s, and John F. Kennedy's famous call to put a man on the moon.\n\nShe noted that the 1960s saw an explosion of PhDs in the science and engineering fields to back up Kennedy's 1961 call--and she is hoping for something similar in the years ahead in universities and high schools to create a bigger semiconductor industry workforce.\n\nThe next step in the administration's plan will come next Tuesday when Raimondo's department unveils the formal application that manufacturing companies will need to access the money. \"It's going to be a very comprehensive application, which will be crystal clear about the specific criteria that we'll be looking for and the information we need from companies,\" Raimondo told reporters.\n\nThe speech also nodded to concerns that the billions, once they are signed over, could end going to things like stock buybacks. During her speech, Raimondo promised to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars and said she would will demand transparency from companies. A recent letter from prominent lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called on the administration to be vigilant on the buyback issue, saying it could undermine the national security goals of the program.\n\n\"I expect to be held accountable,\" Raimondo said.\n\nMeanwhile, the race for the money remains well underway with places like Arizona making a play to be one of the manufacturing hubs.\n\nRaimondo said she hopes the $50 billion in government funds will lead to somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 billion in private investment.\n\n\"Get in the boat, row with us to achieve this mission,\" she said during the speech in a comment directed towards private investors around the country. \"I don't want to spend a dime that I don't have to.\"\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or Android\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube\nSummary: The Biden administration will unveil bold ambitions Thursday for how it will seek to get the most bang for the billions it has at its disposal to spur the semiconductor sector in the U.S. in the years ahead.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt. The FDA is in the process of developing separate guidelines to address those products.\nSummary: Plant-based milk alternatives, like soy milk, will soon be asked to feature a voluntary remark on their labels that differentiates their nutritional worth from dairy milk.

Deep-field observations are long exposures of regions of the sky that can show distant, difficult-to-see objects.\n\nWebb has already captured several deep-field views of the universe since it began scientific observations in July. Gravitational lensing is crucial for astronomers because it can uncover features of the early universe that are otherwise impossible to see.\n\nPrevious images of the central core of Pandora's Cluster came courtesy of the Hubble Space Telescope. Webb's latest observation of the cluster has revealed never-before-seen details in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nAstronomers in the UNCOVER program, or Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization, used Webb's unique Near-Infrared Camera for 30 hours to capture detailed long-exposure images. The latest photo released Wednesday stitches together four of those images into a panorama that includes 50,000 sources of near-infrared light.\n\nHundreds of faint arced lines in the lower-right image are actually distant galaxies that scientists weren't able to spot with Hubble.\n\nThe many dots of light in the new Webb image represent galaxies. Gravitational lensing can distort the appearance of distant galaxies, making them appear different from the galaxies in the foreground of the image -- which is why the distant galaxies resemble arcs of light.\n\nNext, the research team will go through all of the data in the image and pinpoint galaxies that they'd like to study further this summer to gain new insights into the early universe.\nSummary: The James Webb Space Telescope captured a new image of Pandora's Cluster, a megacluster of galaxies that allowed astronomers to peer into the recent universe and observe never-before-seen details.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Key to managing that growth is FIMS, which will \"enable drones and other low-level operators to safely integrate with existing airspace users\", according to Airservices Australia.\n\nThe system will act as the \"connector\" between UAS and Australia's current airspace management, says Courtney Meares-Whitty, head of the FIMS initiave for Airservices Australia.\n\nGumley says the UTM programme completed field-testing in November of multiple FIMS prototypes developed with private sector partners and is now shifting into the delivery phase - with a target of 2025.\n\nAs it rolls out FIMS over the next three years, the project will also deploy newly developed technologies, including access to improved geospatial data for UAS operators, a surveillance network for tracking drones and a method for the \"detection of non-cooperative drones\".\n\nThe ultimate goal, Gumley says, is to fully-integrate FIMS into the existing air traffic management system for civil aviation - as opposed to a bifurcated or \"segregated\" system in which UAS are managed separately from conventional aircraft.\n\n\"Segregated integration is not a sustainable model for the future,\" he notes.\n\nAirservices Australia says its focus on safely incorporating large numbers of small drones into the existing aviation ecosystem \"will foster growth in the UAS market\".\n\nThe private sector appears to agree with that assessment.\n\n\"UTM solutions are essential,\" says Phillip Swadling, technical director of avionics at Thales. \"The lack of harmonised standards are holding back drone business development,\" he adds.\n\n\"We need practical and pragmatic solutions that facilitate the integration of emerging technologies,\" says Zac Kennedy, chief regulatory officer at Swoop Aero - a Melbourne-based start-up developing networks of commercial UAS to fill gaps in existing logistics systems.\n\nGumley says the goal of the UTM programme is to offer a service that is as frictionless as possible, with \"airspace authorisation measured in seconds, not weeks\" for UAS operators. He notes Airservices Australia is working to deliver automatic airspace approval at all of the country's 29 aerodromes by end of 2023.\n\nUnder an initiative called OneSky Australia, Canberra intends to streamline airspace management even further by combining the civil and military aviation control systems. Airservices Australia and the Department of Defence are jointly developing that infrastructure, known as the Civil Military Air Traffic Management System (CMATS).\n\nGumley says CMATS also will eventually incorporate the launch and recovery of space-bound rockets.\n\nSwadling argues for government to take a more active role in setting a national strategic policy on UAS, which will guide private sector development.\n\n\"There is a need for an integrated and uniform UAS strategy at the national level,\" he says.\nSummary: National air traffic management agency Airservices Australia says it has shifted from prototyping to the delivery phase of an effort to deploy an airspace management tool for small, uncrewed air vehicles such as commercial unmanned air vehicles.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

Some people were also robbed.\n\nIt was the third inquest into the tragedy following pressure from the family. A coroner had initially ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died.\n\nSteve Johnson described the police investigation since the third inquest as \"spectacular.\" But he said his brother's homicide could have been solved easily by police when he died.\n\n\"In fact, many of us believe that it was the police indifference to these killings and bashings of gay men back in the '80s that helped cause them. The perpetrators always knew they would not get into trouble,\" Johnson said.\n\nA New South Wales government inquiry began hearing evidence in November of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.\n\nViolence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, an HIV support group, ACON, told the inquiry.\n\nSteve Johnson, a wealthy entrepreneur, offered a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward in 2020 for information about his brother's death, matching a reward already offered by police.\n\nWhite, 52, was arrested in Sydney that year and pleaded not guilty to the murder of Johnson, who was an Australian National University Ph.D. student living in the capital, Canberra, when he died.\n\nPolice have suggested the reward led to the arrest, saying they expected it would be collected after White's conviction.\n\nWhite took his lawyers by surprise in January last year by pleading guilty to murder during a pretrial hearing.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, White signed a statement saying that he had been \"confused\" when he pleaded guilty, had not caused Johnson's death and wanted to plead not guilty.\n\nBut the judge recorded the guilty plea and White was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison.\n\nIn sentencing White, the judge said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, which would have led to a longer prison term.\n\nIn November, three judges of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that White should have been allowed to reverse his guilty plea, quashing his conviction and sentence.\n\nWhite on Thursday pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. Prosecutors had earlier agreed with White's lawyers to accept the plea.\n\nPolice Deputy Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans told reporters outside the court that the conviction vindicated the Johnson family's long fight for justice.\n\n\"Look, a very emotional day for everyone, especially the Johnson family, who've been through a very traumatic time over the past 34 years and today really vindicates that family, what they've done over many, many years,\" Yeomans said.\n\nThe Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales will report on June 30.\nSummary: An Australian has pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the death of an American who fell from a Sydney clifftop that was known as a gay hangout.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

In a letter to the state prosecutor in Qom, Montazeri said the \"worrying wave of some kind of poisoning\" in schools in the city indicate \"the possibility of intentional criminal actions.\"\n\nEarlier, Mojtaba Zolnour, a lawmaker from Qom, said the illnesses were \"abnormal\" and security officials were investigating. Another parliamentarian from Qom, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, suggested that fear and hysteria could have played a role.\n\nSome have speculated that religious extremists, in a bid to create fear and prevent girls from attending school, could be behind the incidents.\n\nLast week, Nafiseh Moradi, a researcher of Islamic studies at Al Zahra University, an all-female public university in Tehran, said in a commentary that it was suspicious that girls, not boys, were mainly affected by the illnesses. The article on Qom News was later removed.\n\nMany Iranians have accused the authorities of not doing enough to find the cause of the illnesses and prevent new cases. Some angry parents have refused to send their children to school.\n\n\"Of the 250 students in our school, only 50 attended classes,\" a teacher in Qom, who did not want to be named for fear of retribution, told RFE/RL's Radio Farda last week.\n\nA correspondent at the reformist Shargh daily who traveled to Qom reported this week that some schools in the city were \"unofficially\" closed.\n\nLast week, angry parents protested outside the governor's office and called for a transparent investigation. They also demanded that classes be held online, amid reports that the authorities were pressuring students to attend school.\n\nAn unnamed teacher at a girls' school in Qom told Shargh that they have been ordered to teach \"even if only one student\" was present in class. She also said students have been told not to share notes with classmates in an apparent bid to push more pupils to attend school in person.\n\nSome students who have fallen ill have complained of an \"unknown\" or \"unpleasant\" smell.\n\n\"My son recalled that for a moment there was the smell of rotten fish in the classroom,\" an unnamed woman whose son became sick was quoted as saying by the Tejarat News outlet. \"Then the school gave students face masks and told them to leave the classroom.\"\n\n\"Some of the children felt more ill than the others. Several of them were transferred to medical centers. My son was among them,\" the woman said, adding that her son had suffered from stomach pain.\n\nA student who fell ill in early February told Shargh that she spent three days in a hospital.\n\n\"I still feel some weakness in my legs after 20 days, and I have problems while moving my legs,\" the unnamed student said, adding that two of her friends were still in the hospital.\n\nSimilar waves of mysterious illnesses affecting schoolgirls have been reported in recent years in neighboring Afghanistan and in Central Asia. In many cases, the authorities were unable to find evidence of poison. Most of the incidents were blamed on mass panic and hysteria.\nSummary: Hundreds of girls have fallen ill in schools in Iran in the recent weeks, with some hospitalized.

Israeli airlines were banned from the airspace of both Oman and Saudi Arabia. That meant flights to India and Southeast Asia, which would naturally head east from Israel, had to dip south, crossing over Jordan and following the Red Sea down to the bottom of the Arabian Peninsula, before hooking northeast.\n\nNow, all that is set to change. Following the Saudi government's announcement in July 2022 that the country's airspace would open up to all carriers, Oman has followed suit.\n\nEl Al has posted a map of their current and new routes to Southeast Asia From El Al Israel\n\nOn February 23, the Civil Aviation Authority of Oman announced that it will open its airspace to \"all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflying\" - effectively ending the ban on El Al, Israir and Arkia, Israel's three airlines.\n\nIn a tweet, it said the move was \"part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfil its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, which stipulates non-discrimination between civil aircrafts used in international air navigation.\"\n\nThe move could cut Israeli carriers' flight times to Asia by up to three hours, Jonathan Sivarajah, an El Al frequent flier and Israeli aviation commentator, told CNN.\n\nAs part of the Sultanate of Oman's continuous efforts to fulfill its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, the Civil Aviation Authority affirms that the Sultanate's airspace is open for all carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflyuing. pic.twitter.com/jNaqqDxZM1 -- hyy'@ lTWyrn lmdny (@CAAOMN) February 23, 2023\n\nHe added that it \"opens up further opportunities [for the airlines], not only to Asia but potentially to Australia, too.\"\n\nEl Al's nonstop flight from Tel Aviv to Bangkok is currently listed as taking 10 hours 45 minutes. But a nonstop flight on Royal Jordanian from Amman - 100 miles east of Tel Aviv - takes eight hours 10 minutes. In fact, flying Tel Aviv to Amman, and then on to Bangkok can be quicker, even including transfer time at the airport - a connecting flight can take as little as nine hours 55 minutes on Royal Jordanian.\n\nWhen the airline was banned from Saudi airspace, El Al flights from Tel Aviv to Mumbai took seven hours 45 minutes. That flight time was then slashed to five hours 15 minutes, before the route was put on hold.\n\nAs the announcement was made, El Al swiftly posted a map of their old and new routes to Southeast Asia on Instagram.\n\nSivarajah said that until now, competing international carriers have \"flooded\" Israel with quicker flights than what the country's own airlines were able to provide.\n\n\"Tel Aviv-bound foreign carriers such as Air India could operate over territory which El Al couldn't. There was a significant fare difference because of the routing in favor of the likes of Air India,\" he said.\n\n\"It wasn't until the Abraham Accords [of 2020] and the Saudi approval that it became partly possible for Israeli carriers to compete. The last stumbling block was Oman.\"\n\nHe expects the new routings to start \"within the next few days.\"\n\nIn a statement, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it \"a day of great news for Israeli aviation.\"\n\nHe added: \"The Far East is not so far away and the skies are no longer the limit.\n\n\"We have worked to open the airspace, first over Saudi Arabia, and from 2018 when I visited Oman, to add Oman as well, so that we can fly directly to India and on to Australia. This was achieved today, after considerable effort, including in recent months. Here is good news - Israel is opening up to the east on an unprecedented scale.\"\n\nIsrael's Foreign Minister Eli Cohen also released a statement, calling the news \"a historic decision that will shorten the road to Asia, lower costs for Israeli citizens and help Israeli airlines to be more competitive.\" He personally thanked the sultan of Oman, Haitham bin Tariq al-Said, for his \"substantial help\" in the process.\n\nThe announcement came after months of talks between the two countries.\n\nIt also follows an announcement earlier this month that El Al would start a frequent flier partnership with UAE carrier Etihad Airways. Frequent fliers can now collect and spend air miles across both airlines. The two had started codesharing on flights in 2021.\n\nLast year, El Al said that a route from Tel Aviv to Melbourne, Australia, was in the works.\nSummary: Oman is opening up its airports to Israeli carriers, including El Al. Previously, the airlines had to fly a roundabout route to parts of Asia, adding hours to people's journey times.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products.\n\nDairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk.\n\nThe draft recommendations aim to ensure the labels on PBMA products provide consumers with the information they need to make nutritional decisions. For example, the voluntary label recommended by the FDA could read, \"Contains lower amounts of vitamin D and calcium than milk,\" according to an example provided by the agency.\n\n\"Getting enough of the nutrients in milk and fortified soy beverages is especially important to help children grow and develop, and parents and caregivers should know that many plant-based alternatives do not have the same nutrients as milk,\" said Susan T. Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"Food labels are an important way to help support consumer behavior, so we encourage the use of the voluntary nutritional statements to better help customers make informed decisions.\"\n\nThe draft guidance also details how companies should name plant-based milk alternatives. For instance, they should refrain from simply calling these products \"plant-based milk\" because it omits a descriptor of the particular plant, making the product indistinguishable from other PBMA products.\n\nAlso, milk alternatives made from liquid-based extracts of plant materials do not need to cease being labeled as \"milk,\" but their nutritional comparison with dairy should be made clear.\n\nThe draft guidance does not apply to the labeling and naming of other plant-based dairy alternatives, like cheese and yogurt.

In a letter to the state prosecutor in Qom, Montazeri said the \"worrying wave of some kind of poisoning\" in schools in the city indicate \"the possibility of intentional criminal actions.\"\n\nEarlier, Mojtaba Zolnour, a lawmaker from Qom, said the illnesses were \"abnormal\" and security officials were investigating. Another parliamentarian from Qom, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, suggested that fear and hysteria could have played a role.\n\nSome have speculated that religious extremists, in a bid to create fear and prevent girls from attending school, could be behind the incidents.\n\nLast week, Nafiseh Moradi, a researcher of Islamic studies at Al Zahra University, an all-female public university in Tehran, said in a commentary that it was suspicious that girls, not boys, were mainly affected by the illnesses. The article on Qom News was later removed.\n\nMany Iranians have accused the authorities of not doing enough to find the cause of the illnesses and prevent new cases. Some angry parents have refused to send their children to school.\n\n\"Of the 250 students in our school, only 50 attended classes,\" a teacher in Qom, who did not want to be named for fear of retribution, told RFE/RL's Radio Farda last week.\n\nA correspondent at the reformist Shargh daily who traveled to Qom reported this week that some schools in the city were \"unofficially\" closed.\n\nLast week, angry parents protested outside the governor's office and called for a transparent investigation. They also demanded that classes be held online, amid reports that the authorities were pressuring students to attend school.\n\nAn unnamed teacher at a girls' school in Qom told Shargh that they have been ordered to teach \"even if only one student\" was present in class. She also said students have been told not to share notes with classmates in an apparent bid to push more pupils to attend school in person.\n\nSome students who have fallen ill have complained of an \"unknown\" or \"unpleasant\" smell.\n\n\"My son recalled that for a moment there was the smell of rotten fish in the classroom,\" an unnamed woman whose son became sick was quoted as saying by the Tejarat News outlet. \"Then the school gave students face masks and told them to leave the classroom.\"\n\n\"Some of the children felt more ill than the others. Several of them were transferred to medical centers. My son was among them,\" the woman said, adding that her son had suffered from stomach pain.\n\nA student who fell ill in early February told Shargh that she spent three days in a hospital.\n\n\"I still feel some weakness in my legs after 20 days, and I have problems while moving my legs,\" the unnamed student said, adding that two of her friends were still in the hospital.\n\nSimilar waves of mysterious illnesses affecting schoolgirls have been reported in recent years in neighboring Afghanistan and in Central Asia. In many cases, the authorities were unable to find evidence of poison. Most of the incidents were blamed on mass panic and hysteria.\nSummary: Hundreds of girls have fallen sick in mosques in recent weeks in Iran, with some hospitalized.
