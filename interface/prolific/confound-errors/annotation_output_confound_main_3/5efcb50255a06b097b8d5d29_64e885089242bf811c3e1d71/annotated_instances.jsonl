I shall endeavor to regale you with a culinary odyssey, replete with esoteric terminology and gastronomic finesse. Our itinerary shall include a brief excursus on the indigenous ingredients, followed by a step-by-step guide to crafting these delectable delicacies.\n\nFirst and foremost, we must embark on an exploration of the core components of Asian-style fish cakes. The primary ingredients are:\n\n1. Fish: The choice of fish is crucial, as it should be firm, yet flaky, with a mild flavor that complements the seasonings. Cod, snapper, or tilapia work excellently.\n2. Breading: A light, airy batter is essential to create a crispy exterior while maintaining a moist interior. Employ a mixture of all-purpose flour, cornstarch, and potato starch for the perfect balance of texture and flavor.\n3. Seasonings: The essence of Asian-style fish cakes lies in the nuanced harmony of flavors. Combine minced ginger, garlic, soy sauce, sake, mirin (a sweet Japanese cooking wine), and sesame oil for a marinade that infuses the fish with a depth of taste.\n4. Vegetables: Thinly slice carrots and cabbage to add texture and freshness to the cakes.\n\nNow, let us proceed to the nitty-gritty of crafting these culinary masterpieces. Please find below a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Prepare the marinade: In a bowl, whisk together the minced ginger, garlic, soy sauce, sake, mirin, and sesame oil.\n2. Marinate the fish: Place the fish fillets in a separate bowl, and pour the marinade over them. Ensure the fish is coated evenly, then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or overnight.\n3. Prepare the batter: In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, and potato starch"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 79, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5efcb50255a06b097b8d5d29_64e885089242bf811c3e1d71", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "Yes", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "Yes", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 17m 16s "}}
