{"id": "59", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to get a liquor server license?", "Response A": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nThere are a few things you'll need to do in order to get a liquor server license. First, you'll need to complete a training course that will teach you about the proper serving of alcohol. Once you've completed the course, you'll need to pass a test to prove that you've learned the material. After you've passed the test, you'll need to apply for a liquor server license from your local municipality.\n\nOnce you have your license, you'll be able to serve alcohol at your establishment. It's important to remember that serving alcohol is a responsibility, and you'll need to handle it with care. If you're not sure how to do something, it's always best to ask for help.", "Response B": "Sure, it\u2019s a good idea to have a license if you plan to serve alcohol.  The license is issued by the state, so you\u2019ll need to look into the specific requirements in your state.  Generally speaking, you need to be at least 21 years old, pass a test to demonstrate your knowledge of responsible alcohol service, and pay a fee.  You might also need to submit fingerprints and a background check."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 89, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "57d5ab3a722df500017f3622_64e88e89b2cd879f75f201ff", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 19s "}}
