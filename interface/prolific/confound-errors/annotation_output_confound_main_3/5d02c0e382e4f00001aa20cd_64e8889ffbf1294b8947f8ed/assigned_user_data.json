Here are some signs that an employee might be looking for a new job:\n\n1. They start looking at job listings online.\n2. They talk to other people about job opportunities.\n3. They seem more interested in their own work and want to do better.\n4. They start saying goodbye to coworkers and saying they might leave soon.\n\nRemember, it's important to be respectful and not accuse someone of looking for a new job if they're not. It's okay if they want to stay and work hard!", "Response B": "Some signs that an employee may be looking for a new job include: decreased productivity, lack of engagement, frequent absences, increased job searching activity, increased nervousness or agitation, and changes in communication patterns.
