{"id": "817", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to test dog dna and analyze parentage?", "Response A": "There are several ways to test dog DNA and analyze parentage. One way is to use a DNA testing kit, which can be purchased online or at some pet stores. These kits typically include a swab that you can use to collect a sample of your dog's DNA. You then send the sample back to the company for analysis.\n\nAnother way to test dog DNA and analyze parentage is to use a service provided by a veterinarian or animal hospital. They will typically collect a blood sample from your dog and send it to a laboratory for analysis.\n\nIt's important to note that the accuracy of dog DNA tests can vary, so it's always a good idea to consult with a veterinarian or animal geneticist to get the most accurate results.", "Response B": "There are a few ways to test dog DNA and analyze parentage. One way is to use a DNA testing kit, which you can purchase online or at some pet stores. These kits typically involve collecting a sample of your dog's saliva or blood and sending it to a laboratory for analysis. The laboratory will then use genetic testing to determine your dog's DNA profile and compare it to other dogs' DNA profiles to determine its parentage.\n\nAnother way to test dog DNA and analyze parentage is to take your dog to a veterinarian or animal geneticist who can perform a DNA test on your dog. This is typically a more expensive option, but it may be necessary if you are trying to determine the parentage of a specific dog or if you are interested in genetic testing for your dog.\n\nIt's important to note that DNA testing can be a helpful tool for determining parentage, but it is not always accurate. There are many factors that can affect the accuracy of DNA testing, including the quality of the sample, the method of analysis, and the expertise of the laboratory or veterinarian performing the test. It's always a good idea to speak with a veterinarian or animal geneticist before having a DNA test performed on your dog to discuss the potential risks and benefits."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 95, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5bd46b622ef2f00001d29636_64e8834745bc90e3ac856ed7", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "no"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 4s "}}
