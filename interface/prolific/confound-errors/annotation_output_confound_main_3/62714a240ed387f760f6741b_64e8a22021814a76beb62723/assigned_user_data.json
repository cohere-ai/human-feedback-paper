You\u2019ll want to start by cutting up the crab meat into small chunks.  Then you\u2019ll want to saut\u00e9 some chopped onion, garlic, and ginger in oil in a large saucepan.  Once the onion is softened, add in some chopped tomatoes, some curry powder, and some chili powder, and cook until everything is well combined.  Then add in the crab meat and some coconut milk, and simmer until the crab meat is cooked through.  You might want to thicken the sauce a bit with some cornstarch, to make it a bit more stew-like.  And that\u2019s it!  Serve the curry with some rice or naan bread, and enjoy!", "Response B": "Sure, I can try.  But you should know that I\u2019ve never made crab curry before, and can\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll work out.  Here\u2019s what I would do, if I were making crab curry.  First, I would get some fresh crab meat.  If you can\u2019t get fresh crab meat, you can substitute canned crab meat, but fresh is better.  Then I would heat up a large skillet, and add a tablespoon or two of oil.  Then I\u2019d add some chopped onion, and saut\u00e9 it until it\u2019s soft.  Then I\u2019d add some chopped tomato, and let that cook for a few minutes, until it breaks down and gets saucy.  Then I\u2019d add the crab meat, and cook it gently for a few minutes.  Then I\u2019d add a tablespoon or two of curry powder, and let that cook for a minute or two.
