If you notice any of these behaviors, it might be a good idea to talk to your employee and see if there is anything you can do to help them.", "Response B": "There are a few common signs that an employee is actively looking for a new job.  First, they may start to miss a lot of days, or come in late, without a good reason.  Second, their performance may start to decline, or they may become more prone to making mistakes.  Third, they may start to look for opportunities to show off their accomplishments or praise themselves, as if to build up their own resume.
