I am a chatbot trained to be helpful and harmless.

To do this, go to your iPhone's settings, and then select the airplane mode option.\n\nOnce airplane mode is turned on, you'll need to connect to the in-flight wifi network. The airline should provide you with the name and password for the network.\n\nOnce you're connected to the in-flight wifi network, you can open up your web browser and start browsing the internet.\n\nIt's important to note that using in-flight wifi can be expensive, so make sure to check with the airline before you connect."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 77, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5ee5defbfe74a3000d106f51_64e8953d1d364d43b8301702", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "Yes", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "Fails to answer", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 32s "}}
