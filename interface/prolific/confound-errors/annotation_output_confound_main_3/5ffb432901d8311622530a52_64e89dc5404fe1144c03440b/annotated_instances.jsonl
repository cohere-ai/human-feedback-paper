It's important to approach any romantic or social interactions with respect, honesty, and caution.\n\nIf you are interested in someone, it's important to remember that they are a human being with their own thoughts, feelings, and agency. It's important to respect their boundaries and to not pressure or manipulate them into any kind of relationship.\n\nInstead of trying to \"get\" someone to like you back, it may be more helpful to focus on being your authentic self and seeing if there is mutual interest and compatibility. This can involve spending time with the person, getting to know them as an individual, and being open and honest about your own feelings.\n\nHowever, it's also important to remember that not everyone will be interested in you, and that's okay. It's important to respect their decision and to move on in a healthy and respectful way.\n\nI would caution against using any kind of manipulative or coercive tactics to try to get someone to like you back. This can be harmful and can damage the other person's trust and respect for you. It's important to prioritize their well-being and boundaries above your own desires.\n\nIf you are unsure about how to approach a situation with someone you like, it may be helpful to talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for support and guidance. They can provide a safe and confidential space to explore your feelings and options.", "Response B": "Well, it\u2019s not always possible to get someone to like you back, but I can tell you some things that will help.  One thing that\u2019s really important is to be a good friend to the person you like, and to show them how nice you are.  Another thing is to be patient.  The person may need time to realize how great you are.  And it\u2019s important to not pressure them, or make them feel bad if they don\u2019t like you back."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 76, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5ffb432901d8311622530a52_64e89dc5404fe1144c03440b", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "2", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No", "feedback": "None"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 30s "}}
