{"id": "406", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to find themes for tumblr?", "Response A": "Everyone wants to be liked and accepted by others, and it can be a very rewarding experience to develop meaningful relationships with the people you care about. However, establishing emotional connections with others can be a challenging process, and there are no surefire ways to guarantee that someone will like you. There are, however, a few general principles that can help to foster positive relationships with other people, such as showing respect and caring for their well-being, being supportive and understanding, and expressing your emotions honestly and appropriately. In addition, it's often helpful to actively listen to and understand the other person's perspective, and be thoughtful and considerate in your interactions with them. While there are no guarantees that these strategies will make someone like you, treating others with kindness and respect is likely to help you develop more positive relationships.", "Response B": "Sure, I\u2019d be happy to help!  First, I would recommend checking out the official Tumblr support pages to see if they have any information or tips that might be helpful to you.  If that doesn\u2019t meet your needs, then you might want to check out the official Tumblr theme directory, where you can browse and search for a variety of available themes.  If you want to create your own custom theme, you can do that as well, using some basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  If you\u2019re looking for more advanced customization options, you might want to check out third-party tools and services that offer more comprehensive theme-building options.  Finally, if you have specific questions or issues that you need assistance with, you can try posting in the Tumblr Help forum, where the Tumblr community and support team can provide assistance and advice."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": "distractor_85", "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d1e3a4851bab9000116226f_64e896f7cea92ea710941367", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "Response A is answering a different question "}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 57s "}}
