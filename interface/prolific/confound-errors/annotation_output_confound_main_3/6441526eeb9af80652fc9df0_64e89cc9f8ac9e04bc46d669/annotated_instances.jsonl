{"id": "265", "input_text": {"Prompt": "A new wearable device that can help detect and prevent oncoming asthma attacks has been developed by medical device company, Quvium.\n\n\u00d7 Expand Asthma Device\n\nCoughAware is a wearable device that is aimed at helping asthma sufferers, particularly children, deal with their condition. The device is worn around the neck and monitors the wearer, listening out for coughs. As a cough is the first sign of an impending asthma attack the device allows the wearer, parent or carer to act early and potentially prevent the attacks.\n\nThe device detects coughs that might be potential indicators of an asthma attack, it then sends out a text alert to the user or the carer's mobile. The data the device receives is then uploaded to an online database. As the 'cough library' grows and results become more accurate, Quvium hope to learn more about asthma.\n\nCoughAware isn't solely intended for sufferers of asthma. The device can be used for patients with cystic fibrosis and people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nIn a case study using the CoughAware with children suffering from asthma, Quvium saw results that decreased the yearly number of times children missed days of school and visited the E.R.\n\n8 million people have been diagnosed with asthma in the UK and the disease costs the NHS \u00a31 billion per year. Figures show that around 1,200 asthma sufferers die every year, a figure that given the manageability of the disease, should be closer to zero.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Quvium's CoughAware is a groundbreaking wearable device that utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to detect and prevent oncoming asthma attacks by analyzing cough patterns. Designed to be worn around the neck, the device is capable of monitoring the wearer's coughs and sending text alerts to the user or their carer when potential indicators of an asthma attack are detected. This timely alert system enables early intervention, potentially preventing the progression of the attack and mitigating the risk of severe complications.\n\nBy analyzing the data collected from the device and uploading it to an online database, Quvium aims to continuously improve the accuracy of its cough library, enabling more effective detection and prevention of asthma attacks. The CoughAware device is not limited to asthma sufferers alone; it can also be used for patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nIn a recent case study, Quvium demonstrated the effectiveness of CoughAware in reducing the number of school days missed and emergency room visits among children suffering from asthma. This innovative device has the potential to revolutionize the management of asthma, a disease that affects approximately 8 million people in the UK and costs the National Health Service (NHS) \u00a31 billion per year, resulting in approximately 1,200 deaths annually.\n\nQuvium's CoughAware device is a technological breakthrough that offers hope for asthma sufferers, particularly children, by providing an early warning system that can help prevent the progression of asthma attacks and potentially save lives. With its advanced machine learning algorithms and ability to continuously improve its accuracy, CoughAware is poised to become an invaluable tool in the management of this common and potentially debilitating disease.", "Response B": "A new wearable device called CoughAware has been developed by Quvium to help detect and prevent oncoming asthma attacks.
