Pour batter into prepared cupcake pan. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. Let cupcakes cool in pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.", "Response B": "Sure, I\u2019ve actually made these before and have some guidance to offer! First you\u2019ll need to make the cupcakes themselves. The recipe I recommend is from cookmoreworryless.com: https://cookmoreworryless.com/wicked-musical-cupcakes/ They come out very moist and delicious, and are the perfect canvas for your cupcake decoration. Next you can follow this video tutorial from the Cupcake Collective to create the beautiful flower cupcake toppers: https://youtu.be/kUv1VQk2QjA. The hardest part is getting the fondant to stick to the cupcake, but as long as you use enough buttercream as \u201cglue\u201d, it should work out well. Finally, I recommend ordering these edible glitter sheets to add some sparkle to the beautiful roses you\u2019ll create: https://amzn.to/3lz0h9u. I hope this helps you make some beautiful cupcakes and have a great time at your Wicked musical event!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 82, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "57c957626736cf0001b31f39_64e892a803351360300a1296", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "no"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 29s "}}
