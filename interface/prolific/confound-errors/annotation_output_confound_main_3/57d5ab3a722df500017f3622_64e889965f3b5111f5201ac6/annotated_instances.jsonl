Tepco used giant cranes to lift one fuel handling machine, which was destroyed when a quake-sparked tsunami sent some of the plant's reactors into meltdown in March 2011. The fuel handling machine was a key part of the process that transferred nuclear fuel assemblies into the reactor core. The company described the delicate operation as a critical step toward clearing highly radioactive spent fuel rods from the cooling pool inside its badly damaged Reactor number 3.", "Response B": "Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) has successfully removed a 20-ton piece of rubble from a destroyed reactor at the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant. This is a major step forward in decommissioning the plant and paves the way for continued progress. The operation was completed after several months of planning and is expected to last until the second half of 2021, with decommissioning efforts overall expected to last several decades. The announcement comes several days after the government said compensation costs from the disaster are expected to be more than $57 billion."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 77, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "57d5ab3a722df500017f3622_64e889965f3b5111f5201ac6", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 13s "}}
