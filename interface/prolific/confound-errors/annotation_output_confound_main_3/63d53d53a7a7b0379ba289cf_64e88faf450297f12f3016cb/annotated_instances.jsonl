{"id": "565", "input_text": {"Prompt": "A new wearable device that can help detect and prevent oncoming asthma attacks has been developed by medical device company, Quvium.\n\n\u00d7 Expand Asthma Device\n\nCoughAware is a wearable device that is aimed at helping asthma sufferers, particularly children, deal with their condition. The device is worn around the neck and monitors the wearer, listening out for coughs. As a cough is the first sign of an impending asthma attack the device allows the wearer, parent or carer to act early and potentially prevent the attacks.\n\nThe device detects coughs that might be potential indicators of an asthma attack, it then sends out a text alert to the user or the carer's mobile. The data the device receives is then uploaded to an online database. As the 'cough library' grows and results become more accurate, Quvium hope to learn more about asthma.\n\nCoughAware isn't solely intended for sufferers of asthma. The device can be used for patients with cystic fibrosis and people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nIn a case study using the CoughAware with children suffering from asthma, Quvium saw results that decreased the yearly number of times children missed days of school and visited the E.R.\n\n8 million people have been diagnosed with asthma in the UK and the disease costs the NHS \u00a31 billion per year. Figures show that around 1,200 asthma sufferers die every year, a figure that given the manageability of the disease, should be closer to zero.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "CoughAware is a wearable device that aims to detect and prevent oncoming asthma attacks.

In a case study, results showed fewer emergency room visits and decreased school absences. Approximately 8 million people in the UK have asthma, and the condition costs the NHS \u00a31 billion per year. However, the disease is manageable, so the deaths of 1,200 people per year are preventable.", "Response B": "A new wearable device called CoughAware has been developed by Quvium to help detect and prevent oncoming asthma attacks.
