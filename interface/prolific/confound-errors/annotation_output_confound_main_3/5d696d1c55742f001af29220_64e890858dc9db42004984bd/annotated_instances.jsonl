The EU rules state that a driver posted temporarily away from home should be 'guaranteed' the host nation's 'minimum rates of pay' and conditions, but companies can exploit loopholes in the law. It is clear that this way of treating drivers is widespread and not just within the IKEA supply chain, but also in those of several other big household names. Legal action is now being taken against some of IKEA's contractors. The BBC investigation found that drivers' pay was not consistent with Dutch wages law, and conditions for the drivers were an 'inhumane state of affairs', contrary to EU law. IKEA stated that it takes the testimonies from the drivers 'very seriously' and is 'saddened' by them. The company said it puts 'strict demands' on its suppliers concerning wages, working conditions, and following applicable legislation, and audits them regularly to check compliance.", "Response B": "Companies can exploit loopholes in EU law on HGV drivers' rights, according to the BBC.
