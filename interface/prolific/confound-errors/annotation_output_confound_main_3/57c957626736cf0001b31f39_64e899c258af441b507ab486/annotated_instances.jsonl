{"id": "338", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to tell if an employee is looking for a new job?", "Response A": "It can be difficult to determine if an employee is looking for a new job without directly asking them. However, there are some signs that may indicate that an employee is considering a job change. Some of these signs include:\n\n- Increased absenteeism: If an employee is regularly absent from work or late for work, it may be a sign that they are looking for a new job.\n- Decreased productivity: If an employee's productivity decreases or they are no longer meeting deadlines, it may be a sign that they are not fully engaged in their work and are considering a job change.\n- Increased interest in personal projects: If an employee is spending more time on personal projects or outside activities, it may be a sign that they are not fully committed to their current job and are looking for a new opportunity.\n- Increased networking: If an employee is attending more networking events or actively looking for new connections, it may be a sign that they are considering a job change.\n- Increased stress: If an employee is stressed or anxious about their job, it may be a sign that they are unhappy with their current situation and are looking for a new job.\n\nIt's important to note that these signs may not necessarily indicate that an employee is looking for a new job. It's always best to directly ask an employee if they are considering a job change.", "Response B": "Some signs that an employee might be looking for a new job include if they are frequently absent from work, if they are not completing their work tasks, or if they are not following company policies. If you notice any of these behaviors, it might be a good idea to talk to your employee and see if there is anything you can do to help them."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 87, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "57c957626736cf0001b31f39_64e899c258af441b507ab486", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "no"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 14s "}}
