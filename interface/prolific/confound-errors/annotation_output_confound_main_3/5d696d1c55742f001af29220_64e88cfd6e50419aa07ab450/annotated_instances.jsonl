Here\u2019s what I would do, if I were making crab curry.  First, I would get some fresh crab meat.  If you can\u2019t get fresh crab meat, you can substitute canned crab meat, but fresh is better.  Then I would heat up a large skillet, and add a tablespoon or two of oil.  Then I\u2019d add some chopped onion, and saut\u00e9 it until it\u2019s soft.  Then I\u2019d add some chopped tomato, and let that cook for a few minutes, until it breaks down and gets saucy.  Then I\u2019d add the crab meat, and cook it gently for a few minutes.  Then I\u2019d add a tablespoon or two of curry powder, and let that cook for a minute or two.  Then I\u2019d add a cup or two of coconut milk, and let it cook gently until it\u2019s hot and everything is"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 98, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d696d1c55742f001af29220_64e88cfd6e50419aa07ab450", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "Yes", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 2s "}}
