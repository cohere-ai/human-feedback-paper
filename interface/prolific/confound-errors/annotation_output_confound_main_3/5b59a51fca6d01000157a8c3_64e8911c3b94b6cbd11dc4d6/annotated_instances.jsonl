{"id": "540", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to clean a hot tub?", "Response A": "Sure! Here are the steps to clean a hot tub:\n\n1. Empty the hot tub of any water and debris.\n2. Remove the hot tub cover and let it air dry.\n3. Use a hot tub cleaning solution to scrub the surfaces of the hot tub.\n4. Use a filter cleaner to clean the filter.\n5. Rinse the hot tub thoroughly with fresh water.\n6. Re-fill the hot tub with fresh water and start the jets.\n\nIt's important to follow the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning and maintenance of your specific hot tub model.", "Response B": "Certainly! To clean a hot tub, you will need to follow a few steps to ensure that it is properly sanitized and safe to use.\n\nFirst, you will need to drain the hot tub completely and remove any debris that may have accumulated in the water. This can be done by using a skimmer to remove any large objects, and then using a filter to remove any smaller particles.\n\nNext, you will need to clean the inside of the hot tub. This can be done by using a mild soap and water solution to scrub down the walls and floor of the hot tub. Be sure to pay special attention to any areas that may have become particularly dirty, such as the jets or the filter.\n\nOnce the inside of the hot tub has been thoroughly cleaned, you will need to refill it with fresh water. Be sure to use a filter to remove any debris that may have entered the water during the refilling process.\n\nFinally, you will need to add a sanitizer to the water to kill any remaining bacteria or other contaminants. This can be done by using a product such as chlorine or bromine, or by using a natural alternative such as hydrogen peroxide or baking soda.\n\nIt is important to note that the specific steps for cleaning a hot tub may vary depending on the model and manufacturer. Be sure to consult the owner's manual for your specific hot tub for detailed instructions on how to properly clean it."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 96, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5b59a51fca6d01000157a8c3_64e8911c3b94b6cbd11dc4d6", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "It is good, but less detailed than option B.
