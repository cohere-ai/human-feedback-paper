Fondant cherry blossoms are easy to make with just a few basic steps, and can add a lovely decorative touch to cakes, cookies, and other desserts.  \n\nFirst, roll out a ball of white fondant into a thin, flat circle.  Next, use a small, round fondant cutter (or a small, round object like a coin or button) to cut out several circles from the fondant.
