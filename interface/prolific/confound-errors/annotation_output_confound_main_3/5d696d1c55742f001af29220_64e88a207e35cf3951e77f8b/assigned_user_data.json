I've never used a picture collage maker pro before, and I wouldn't want to give you any incorrect information. However, I can try to find some general information about how to make a card using a picture collage maker.\n\nFirst, you'll need to find a picture collage maker software that you're comfortable with. There are many different options available online, so you may want to do some research to find one that suits your needs. Some popular options include Adobe Photoshop Elements, Picture Collage Maker, and PhotoDirector.\n\nOnce you have the software, you can start by selecting the photos you want to use for your card. You can choose photos from your computer or import them from a digital camera or online photo storage service.\n\nNext, you'll need to decide on the layout and design of your card. You can choose from a variety of pre-designed templates or create your own custom design. Some picture collage maker software allows you to drag and drop photos onto the card, while others may require you to use a more complex design interface.\n\nWhen you're happy with your card design, you can save it and print it out. Be sure to check the printer settings to ensure that your card comes out looking the way you want it to.\n\nI hope this information is helpful! If you have any more questions, I'll do my best to help. However, please keep in mind that I'm just an AI and my knowledge of picture collage maker software may be limited.", "Response B": "Well, I\u2019ve never heard of that app, so I\u2019d need to look it up.
