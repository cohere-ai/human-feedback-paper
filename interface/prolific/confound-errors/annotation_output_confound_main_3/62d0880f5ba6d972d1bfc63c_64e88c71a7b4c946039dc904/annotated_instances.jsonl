{"id": "640", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to tell if an employee is looking for a new job?", "Response A": "It can be difficult to determine if an employee is looking for a new job without directly asking them. However, there are some signs that may indicate that an employee is considering a job change. Some of these signs include:\n\n- Increased absenteeism: If an employee is regularly absent from work or late for work, it may be a sign that they are looking for a new job.\n- Decreased productivity: If an employee's productivity decreases or they are no longer meeting deadlines, it may be a sign that they are not fully engaged in their work and are considering a job change.\n- Increased interest in personal projects: If an employee is spending more time on personal projects or outside activities, it may be a sign that they are not fully committed to their current job and are looking for a new opportunity.\n- Increased networking: If an employee is attending more networking events or actively looking for new connections, it may be a sign that they are considering a job change.\n- Increased stress: If an employee is stressed or anxious about their job, it may be a sign that they are unhappy with their current situation and are looking for a new job.\n\nIt's important to note that these signs may not necessarily indicate that an employee is looking for a new job. It's always best to directly ask an employee if they are considering a job change.", "Response B": "Hello! I can help you with that. Here are some signs that an employee might be looking for a new job:\n\n1. They start looking at job listings online.\n2. They talk to other people about job opportunities.\n3. They seem more interested in their own work and want to do better.\n4. They start saying goodbye to coworkers and saying they might leave soon.\n\nRemember, it's important to be respectful and not accuse someone of looking for a new job if they're not. It's okay if they want to stay and work hard!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 87, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "62d0880f5ba6d972d1bfc63c_64e88c71a7b4c946039dc904", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No", "feedback": "I think both responses would resonate with the requester in different ways.
