{"id": "20", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to test dog dna and analyze parentage?", "Response A": "Testing dog DNA can be a great way to learn more about your dog's genetic makeup and health history. There are several companies that offer DNA testing services for dogs, and the process typically involves collecting a small sample of your dog's saliva or blood and sending it to the company for analysis.\n\nTo analyze parentage, you can use DNA testing to compare the DNA of two dogs to determine if they are related. This can be useful for determining if two dogs are related, such as if they are siblings or if they are related through a common ancestor.\n\nIt's important to note that DNA testing is not always accurate and can have limitations. For example, it can not always determine the exact relationship between two dogs, and it can not always detect mutations that are not present in the DNA. Additionally, DNA testing can not always determine the health history of a dog, as it can not always detect genetic conditions that are not present in the DNA.", "Response B": "There are several ways to test dog DNA and analyze parentage. One way is to use a DNA testing kit, which can be purchased online or at some pet stores. These kits typically include a swab that you can use to collect a sample of your dog's DNA. You then send the sample back to the company for analysis.\n\nAnother way to test dog DNA and analyze parentage is to use a service provided by a veterinarian or animal hospital. They will typically collect a blood sample from your dog and send it to a laboratory for analysis.\n\nIt's important to note that the accuracy of dog DNA tests can vary, so it's always a good idea to consult with a veterinarian or animal geneticist to get the most accurate results."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 95, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "64649341d6cf5354575444d1_64e89f49cfa36f91e2f457b9", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "It was more detailed which I prefered.", "factors_b": "No", "feedback": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 9m 42s "}}
