This will ensure that drivers will not lose engine performance to gain fuel efficiency from downsized engines.The company quoted Global Insight IHS and said that By 2025, 48-Volt hybrids are expected to make up more than 95 percent of the world's mild hybrid market and about half of all hybrid vehicles Take a look at the infographic to get how the technology works.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Using a 48 volt battery instead of a 12 volt battery allows cars to be more fuel efficient without losing engine performance. This is because the 48 volt battery can provide torque in the low rpm range, which allows for smaller, more fuel efficient engines. It can also capture energy that is typically lost while braking.
