First, turn off the light bulb and allow it to cool completely. Next, carefully remove the light bulb from the socket and place it in the glass jar. Add a small amount of vinegar to the microfiber cloth and gently wipe the light bulb to remove any dirt or dust. Be sure to avoid any areas of the light bulb that are hot, as this could cause the vinegar to evaporate and potentially damage the light bulb. Once the light bulb is clean, carefully replace it in the socket and turn it on to ensure it is working properly.
