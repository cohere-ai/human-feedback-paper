{"id": "129", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to tell if an employee is looking for a new job?", "Response A": "It can be difficult to determine if an employee is looking for a new job without directly asking them. However, there are some signs that may indicate that an employee is considering a job change. Some of these signs include:\n\n- Increased absenteeism: If an employee is regularly absent from work or late for work, it may be a sign that they are looking for a new job.\n- Decreased productivity: If an employee's productivity decreases or they are no longer meeting deadlines, it may be a sign that they are not fully engaged in their work and are considering a job change.\n- Increased interest in personal projects: If an employee is spending more time on personal projects or outside activities, it may be a sign that they are not fully committed to their current job and are looking for a new opportunity.\n- Increased networking: If an employee is attending more networking events or actively looking for new connections, it may be a sign that they are considering a job change.\n- Increased stress: If an employee is stressed or anxious about their job, it may be a sign that they are unhappy with their current situation and are looking for a new job.\n\nIt's important to note that these signs may not necessarily indicate that an employee is looking for a new job. It's always best to directly ask an employee if they are considering a job change.", "Response B": "There are a few common signs that an employee is actively looking for a new job.  First, they may start to miss a lot of days, or come in late, without a good reason.  Second, their performance may start to decline, or they may become more prone to making mistakes.  Third, they may start to look for opportunities to show off their accomplishments or praise themselves, as if to build up their own resume.  Finally, they may start to look at other job opportunities, apply for new jobs, or talk to headhunters."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 87, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "62eae330e31dcc26183e2987_64e8a25c8e1c6a9d506ee79d", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 4s "}}
