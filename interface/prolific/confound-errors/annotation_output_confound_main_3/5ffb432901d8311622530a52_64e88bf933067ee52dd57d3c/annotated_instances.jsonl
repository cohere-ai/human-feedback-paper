Uber called for the proposals to be delayed until after court proceedings due next February at the very least.", "Response B": "Uber is appealing a recent court decision that would require its London drivers to pass additional English language tests.  The proposed rules, which have not yet been implemented, would require drivers to pass a written test in order to renew their licenses, and Uber estimates that this would disqualify tens of thousands of its drivers.  The company argues that the rules are discriminatory and would significantly harm its business in London.  There has been increasing regulatory pressure on Uber in recent months, following a string of scandals and controversies involving the company."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 86, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5ffb432901d8311622530a52_64e88bf933067ee52dd57d3c", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No", "feedback": "None"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 8s "}}
