The EU rules state that a driver posted temporarily away from home should be 'guaranteed' the host nation's 'minimum rates of pay' and conditions, but companies can exploit loopholes in the law. It is clear that this way of treating drivers is widespread and not just within the IKEA supply chain, but also in those of several other big household names. Legal action is now being taken against some of IKEA's contractors. The BBC investigation found that drivers' pay was not consistent with Dutch wages law, and conditions for the drivers were an 'inhumane state of affairs', contrary to EU law. IKEA stated that it takes the testimonies from the drivers 'very seriously' and is 'saddened' by them. The company said it puts 'strict demands' on its suppliers concerning wages, working conditions, and following applicable legislation, and audits them regularly to check compliance.", "Response B": "IKEA works with many companies to supply its stores. Some of these companies are based in Eastern Europe and bring drivers from poorer countries to Western Europe, where they live in their trucks for months. These drivers are paid very little, much less than they would be paid in Western Europe. This is illegal, but the companies are exploiting loopholes in the law. IKEA says it is sad about what the drivers have told the BBC and puts strict demands on its suppliers, but some of IKEA's contractors have been found to be breaking the law."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 89, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63eaace3d44d695631f32db0_64e8a0a6d8663b1312cedb08", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "no"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 6m 58s "}}
