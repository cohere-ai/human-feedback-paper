{"id": "103", "input_text": {"Prompt": "NEW DELHI: The automotive industry has been looking to find a cost effective solution in hybrid technology. According to Delphi , the answer could be in the 48-volt battery \"For an industry that has tried everything from 300-600 volts with pure electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids and big lithium-ion batteries, a widespread 48-Volt strategy may offer the biggest bang for the buck. Europe is calling for CO2 emissions reductions of more than 25 percent by 2021 and regulations in China and the U.S. will require tighter CO2 mandates over the next decade,\" Delphi said in a release.Explaining the technology, Delphi says that 48-Volt mild hybrids, for gasoline or diesel engines, could reduce the percentage of CO2 emissions by double digits, capture energy typically lost while braking and provide torque in the low rpm range for anemic start-stop hybrids. This will ensure that drivers will not lose engine performance to gain fuel efficiency from downsized engines.The company quoted Global Insight IHS and said that By 2025, 48-Volt hybrids are expected to make up more than 95 percent of the world's mild hybrid market and about half of all hybrid vehicles Take a look at the infographic to get how the technology works.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The automotive industry is exploring hybrid technology to find a cost-effective solution.
