AMMB's share price was no exception, according to him.\n\n\"Has the 1MDB and the Malaysian economy and all those situations, impacted the AmBank share price? Unquestionably.\"\n\n\"It's impacted the valuation of lots of things in Malaysia, so it will have had an impact. But it's not a direct response to that,\" Elliott was quoted as saying in a press conference yesterday (May 3), during the announcement of ANZ's first-half financials.\n\nANZ via ANZ Funds Pty Ltd is the largest shareholder in AMMB, with a 23.78% stake.\n\nAt Bursa Malaysia today, AMMB shares rose eight sen or 1.8% at 12:30pm to RM4.56 for a market value of RM13.72 billion.\n\nAMMB's current share price compares with the stock's one-year intraday high at RM6.21 seen on May 5, 2015.\n\nIn Australia yesterday, Elliott said there was \"no 1MDB issue\" for the ANZ board to discuss.\n\n\"We don't have an exposure to 1MDB. In terms of our partnership or the minority investment that we have in (AmBank's holding company) AMMB, all of those stakes get discussed regularly,\" he said.\n\nYesterday, ANZ said it incurred a A$260 million (about RM1.03 billion) impairment for its investment in AMMB during the first half ended March 31, 2016 (1HFY16).\n\nANZ told the Australian bourse that the AMMB impairment was among reasons for ANZ's weaker 1HFY16 financials, compared to a year earlier. During 1HFY16, ANZ said statutory profit after tax fell to A$2.74 billion, from A$3.51 billion.\n\nAt the press conference, Elliott said ANZ had cut its investment value in AMMB by almost 20% or A$260 million.\n\nThe Australian reported that \"ANZ chief financial officer Graeme Hodges refused to say how much money AmBank had on loan to 1MDB.\"\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "ANZ's CEO, Shayne Elliott, has revealed that concerns about 1MDB have had an indirect impact on ANZ's investment in AmBank, which owns a stake in AMMB Holdings.
