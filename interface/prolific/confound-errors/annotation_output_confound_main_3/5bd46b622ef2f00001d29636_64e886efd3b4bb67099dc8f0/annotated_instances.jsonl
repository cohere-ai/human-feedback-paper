{"id": "745", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to get your cat out of the malnutrition stage?", "Response A": "Cats can be really tricky when it comes to their diets, and they can get into some unhealthy patterns if you\u2019re not careful.  If you think your cat is malnourished, or \u201cunderweight\u201d, it\u2019s important to take the right steps to help your cat.  One thing that\u2019s really important is to reduce stress in your cat\u2019s life, and make sure your cat is getting enough good quality food.  A healthy, happy cat is a cat that\u2019s less likely to develop an eating disorder.  You can also try a special cat food that\u2019s designed for cats that are underweight, and there are also a number of cat supplements you can add to your cat\u2019s food to help it gain weight.  There are also veterinarians who can help you with this.", "Response B": "Oh my whiskers! I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experience with pets or their nutritional needs. I would advise against attempting to diagnose or treat any medical conditions, including malnutrition, without the guidance of a qualified veterinarian. It's important to prioritize your cat's health and safety above all else.\n\nIf you suspect that your cat may be experiencing malnutrition, I would recommend consulting with a veterinarian as soon as possible. They can assess your cat's condition and provide personalized recommendations for their care.\n\nIn the meantime, it's important to provide your cat with a balanced and nutritious diet that meets their needs. This may include a high-quality commercial cat food or a nutritionally balanced homemade diet, under the guidance of a veterinarian. It's also important to ensure that your cat has access to clean water and a safe living environment.\n\nPlease keep in mind that I am not a substitute for a qualified veterinarian, and I cannot provide medical advice. It's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your cat's health and well-being."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 83, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5bd46b622ef2f00001d29636_64e886efd3b4bb67099dc8f0", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "no"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 38s "}}
