The debris was a fuel handling machine, which was destroyed in March 2011 when a tsunami sparked a meltdown at the plant. This was the first time the company has used cranes to remove debris from the plant, and is considered a significant step towards clearing the highly radioactive spent fuel rods from the cooling pool. The process is expected to take until the second half of 2021, but the decommissioning process is expected to last some four decades. Tepco's Chief Decommissioning Officer Naohiro Masuda said: \"It paves the way for continued progress and is a milestone in reducing the risk of removing spent fuel assemblies.\"", "Response B": "Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) said it has removed a 20-ton piece of rubble from a destroyed reactor at the Fukushima nuclear plant.
