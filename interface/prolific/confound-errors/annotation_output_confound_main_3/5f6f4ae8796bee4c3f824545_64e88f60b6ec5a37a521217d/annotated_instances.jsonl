The bank is expecting a claim will be filed later this week.\n\nIt is understood CBA has no interest in settling with the regulator so long as it is required to provide an admission of unconscionable conduct. All of the banks are concerned such as admission will expose them to damages claims through class actions, after plaintiff law firm Maurice Blackburn said last month it is investigating such actions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Federal Court has set a provisional trial date for the cases of August 1 next year.\n\nTried together\n\nIn a case management hearing last month, Federal Court judge Jonathan Beach pushed back on ASIC's request for the case against ANZ to be heard first, which could have created a legal precedent to put pressure on the other banks to settle.\n\nRather, Justice Beach said his \"provisional view\" is that the three cases be tried together. He wants all the common issues vented at the first stage, and then to hear all the ANZ-specific issues, then the Westpac-specific issues and then the NAB-specific issues.\n\n\"I accept that in terms of the detail of some of the allegations and transactions there is still more to be disclosed by ASIC and to be looked at by each of the three banks, but it seems to be in relation to the matters of principle that I think all parties should have a fairly reasonable idea of what those issues of principle are at the moment,\" the judge said.\n\nAnother case management hearing is due to be held on August 22.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "ASIC is filing new claims against Westpac and ANZ, alleging unconscionable conduct.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has filed a case in the Federal Court, arguing that NAB's alleged behaviour amounts to unconscionable conduct.
