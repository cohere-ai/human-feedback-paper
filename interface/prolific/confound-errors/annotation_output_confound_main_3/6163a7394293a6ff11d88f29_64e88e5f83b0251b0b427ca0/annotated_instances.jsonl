{"id": "599", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to clean a hot tub?", "Response A": "Certainly! To clean a hot tub, you will need to follow a few steps to ensure that it is properly sanitized and safe to use.\n\nFirst, you will need to drain the hot tub completely and remove any debris that may have accumulated in the water. This can be done by using a skimmer to remove any large objects, and then using a filter to remove any smaller particles.\n\nNext, you will need to clean the inside of the hot tub. This can be done by using a mild soap and water solution to scrub down the walls and floor of the hot tub. Be sure to pay special attention to any areas that may have become particularly dirty, such as the jets or the filter.\n\nOnce the inside of the hot tub has been thoroughly cleaned, you will need to refill it with fresh water. Be sure to use a filter to remove any debris that may have entered the water during the refilling process.\n\nFinally, you will need to add a sanitizer to the water to kill any remaining bacteria or other contaminants. This can be done by using a product such as chlorine or bromine, or by using a natural alternative such as hydrogen peroxide or baking soda.\n\nIt is important to note that the specific steps for cleaning a hot tub may vary depending on the model and manufacturer. Be sure to consult the owner's manual for your specific hot tub for detailed instructions on how to properly clean it.", "Response B": "Yes, cleaning a hot tub is very important to keep the water clean and safe for use.  The first step is to skim the surface of the water with a net to remove any leaves, dirt, or other debris.  Next, add a hot tub cleaning solution to the water and let it sit for several minutes.  Then use a long-handled brush to scrub the sides and bottom of the tub, and a pool skimmer to remove any debris from the water.  Finally, rinse the tub with a hose to remove all cleaning solution, and replace the water with fresh, clean water."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 96, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6163a7394293a6ff11d88f29_64e88e5f83b0251b0b427ca0", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "Yes", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "2", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No", "feedback": "Answer B does not give sufficient information or methodology.
