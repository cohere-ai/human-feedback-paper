{"id": "194", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Dive Brief:\n\nMassive open online course platform FutureLearn has five new partners in universities from Spain, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia.\n\nAustralia's University of South Wales will offer the first new course in math with Complutense University of Madrid, Durham University and the University of Manchester in the UK, and Japan's Keio University adding courses in 2016.\n\nFutureLearn offers a particularly social environment for MOOC students, giving them the opportunity to \"follow\" preferred peers and interact over all course content.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nFutureLearn has reached nearly 2 million learners since it launched in the fall of 2013. It has 69 partners, primarily in universities, but also other organizations including cultural institutions, professional associations, and businesses.\n\nMassive open online courses reach millions of students in the United States and, in many cases, provide opportunities for students to prove their new skills to employers with badges and other certificates that come with a cost. Yet as nontraditional course providers, they remain outside the mainstream of higher education. The Higher Education Act reauthorization has these types of institutions, along with coding bootcamps and competency-based courses, in mind when it comes to considering change.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "FutureLearn, the online learning platform developed by the UK's Open University, has announced five new partners, including the University of South Wales, Complutense University of Madrid, Durham University, the University of Manchester and Keio University, which will begin offering courses in 2016. The platform is currently used by 69 organisations, including universities, cultural institutions, professional associations and businesses, and has reached nearly two million learners since its launch in 2013.", "Response B": "FutureLearn, a formidable massive open online course (MOOC) platform, has recently established partnerships with five esteemed academic institutions across Spain, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia. These collaborations will introduce new courses in mathematics, further diversifying the platform's offerings and catering to a broader range of learners' interests. Notably, FutureLearn provides a highly social learning environment, allowing students to engage with one another and their preferred peers, thereby fostering a dynamic and interactive community.\n\nSince its inception in 2013, FutureLearn has garnered an impressive learner base of nearly 2 million individuals, with 69 partnerships comprising universities, cultural institutions, professional associations, and businesses. The platform's commitment to offering a diverse array of courses has proven particularly appealing to learners, particularly in the United States, where such nontraditional course providers are gaining increasing recognition and acceptance.\n\nIn fact, the Higher Education Act reauthorization, currently under consideration, explicitly acknowledges the importance of alternative educational pathways, including coding bootcamps, competency-based courses, and MOOCs like FutureLearn. These initiatives aim to provide learners with more flexible and affordable options for acquiring valuable skills and knowledge, ultimately enhancing their employability and career prospects.\n\nIn summary, FutureLearn's latest partnerships and expanding course offerings demonstrate the platform's dedication to offering a comprehensive and dynamic learning experience, catering to the diverse interests and needs of learners worldwide. As the higher education landscape continues to evolve, platforms like FutureLearn are poised to play a significant role in shaping the future of education."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 88, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d02c0e382e4f00001aa20cd_64e89f9658dec15a55b5c2b2", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "says its from open uni in summary which is not mentioned", "factors_b": "summary is too long"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 49s "}}
