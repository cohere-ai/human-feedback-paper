The court had ruled in March that Transport for London (TfL), the city's transport authority, could require Uber drivers to pass a written test on English.  Uber says that the test would mean that about 33,000 drivers could be denied a licence.", "Response B": "Uber is appealing a recent court decision that would require its London drivers to pass additional English language tests.  The proposed rules, which have not yet been implemented, would require drivers to pass a written test in order to renew their licenses, and Uber estimates that this would disqualify tens of thousands of its drivers.  The company argues that the rules are discriminatory and would significantly harm its business in London.  There has been increasing regulatory pressure on Uber in recent months, following a string of scandals and controversies involving the company."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 86, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5b421b9ac2e3810001763252_64e8a33f26ae8fb80397fc87", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "no other factors included.", "factors_b": "no other factors included.", "feedback": "n/a thank you"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 51s "}}
