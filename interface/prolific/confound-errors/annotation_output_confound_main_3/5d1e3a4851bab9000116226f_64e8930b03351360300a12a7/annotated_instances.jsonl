I'm not even sure if I could find a recipe for it. I'm sorry, I can't be of much help here.", "Response B": "Sure! Here are the steps for making fondant cherry blossoms:\n\n1. Start with a ball of fondant and knead it until it is soft and pliable.\n2. Roll the fondant out into a thin sheet.\n3. Cut out small circles with a cherry blossom-shaped cookie cutter.\n4. Place the circles on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n5. Bake the circles in a preheated oven at 200 degrees Fahrenheit for about 15 minutes, or until they are firm and dry.\n6. Once the circles are cool, use a small paintbrush to apply a thin layer of edible glue to the back of each one.\n7. Stick the circles together in a cluster, with the glue holding them in place.\n8. Use a toothpick to make a small hole in the center of the cluster.\n9. Insert a small piece of wire into the hole and twist it to secure it in place.\n10. Repeat these steps to make as many fondant cherry blossoms as you need."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 84, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d1e3a4851bab9000116226f_64e8930b03351360300a12a7", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "Yes", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 45s "}}
