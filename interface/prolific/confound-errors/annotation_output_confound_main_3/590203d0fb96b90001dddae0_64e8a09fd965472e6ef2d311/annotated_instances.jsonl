The use of digital devices can actually increase stress levels and affect mental health. It is important to maintain a healthy balance between technology use and other activities that promote relaxation and stress relief, such as exercise, meditation, and spending time with loved ones.\n\nInstead, I suggest taking a break from your tablet and engaging in activities that promote relaxation and stress relief. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Exercise: Physical activity can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being. Find an exercise that you enjoy, such as walking, jogging, or yoga, and make it a regular part of your routine.\n2. Meditation: Mindfulness meditation can help calm your mind and reduce stress. You can find guided meditation apps or videos online that can help you get started.\n3. Connect with others: Spend time with loved ones, engage in hobbies, or join a community group to build social connections and reduce stress.\n4. Get enough sleep: Adequate sleep is essential for managing stress and improving overall health. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night.\n5.
