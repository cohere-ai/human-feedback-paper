{"id": "804", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to clean a hot tub?", "Response A": "Of course, I'd be happy to help! Cleaning a hot tub requires some regular maintenance to keep it in good condition and ensure the water is safe for use. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to clean a hot tub:\n\n1. Test the water: Before you start cleaning, it's essential to test the water to ensure it's safe for use. Use a hot tub test strips or a pH test kit to check the water's pH level, alkalinity, and calcium hardness.\n2. Remove any debris: Start by removing any visible debris, such as leaves or twigs, from the hot tub using a skimmer or a leaf rake.\n3. Clean the hot tub cover: The cover of your hot tub can accumulate dirt, algae, and other contaminants over time. Use a mild detergent and a soft-bristled brush to clean the cover. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that can damage the cover.\n4. Clean the hot tub shell: Use a soft-bristled brush to scrub the hot tub shell, paying particular attention to any areas with visible algae or dirt buildup.\n5. Clean the jets and return fittings: Use a brush or a small scrubber to clean the jets and return fittings. Make sure to remove any algae or dirt that may be clogging them.\n6. Vacuum the hot tub: Use a hot tub vacuum to remove any debris or sediment from the bottom of the hot tub.\n7. Shock the water: Shocking the water is an essential step in cleaning your hot tub. It helps to kill any bacteria or algae that may be present in the water. Use a non-chlorine shock treatment, and follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper dosing.\n8. Balance the water: After shocking the water, you'll need to balance the pH level, alkalinity, and calcium hardness to ensure the water is safe for use. Use a hot tub test kit to check the water's balance, and adjust as needed.\n9. Filter the water: Run the hot tub's filter for at least 24 hours", "Response B": "Yes, cleaning a hot tub is very important to keep the water clean and safe for use.  The first step is to skim the surface of the water with a net to remove any leaves, dirt, or other debris.  Next, add a hot tub cleaning solution to the water and let it sit for several minutes.  Then use a long-handled brush to scrub the sides and bottom of the tub, and a pool skimmer to remove any debris from the water.  Finally, rinse the tub with a hose to remove all cleaning solution, and replace the water with fresh, clean water."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 96, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "62e16e79326aa8ba7e6edeaf_64e8a3c0294f8019356ee776", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "Detailed and clear response", "factors_b": "Short response, but answers the request"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 1s "}}
