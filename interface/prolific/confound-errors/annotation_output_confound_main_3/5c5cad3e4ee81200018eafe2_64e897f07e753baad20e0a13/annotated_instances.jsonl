{"id": "382", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make crab curry?", "Response A": "Sure!  Crab curry is a delicious Indian dish.  You\u2019ll want to start by cutting up the crab meat into small chunks.  Then you\u2019ll want to saut\u00e9 some chopped onion, garlic, and ginger in oil in a large saucepan.  Once the onion is softened, add in some chopped tomatoes, some curry powder, and some chili powder, and cook until everything is well combined.  Then add in the crab meat and some coconut milk, and simmer until the crab meat is cooked through.  You might want to thicken the sauce a bit with some cornstarch, to make it a bit more stew-like.  And that\u2019s it!  Serve the curry with some rice or naan bread, and enjoy!", "Response B": "Sure, to make crab curry you'll need the following ingredients:\n\n-1 lb of crab meat\n-2 tbsp of olive oil\n-2 tbsp of red curry paste\n-1 cup of coconut milk\n-1 tsp of salt\n-1 tsp of black pepper\n-1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper\n\nYou'll also need:\n\n-1 medium onion\n-1 medium red bell pepper\n-1 stalk of celery\n-2 cloves of garlic\n\nFirst, you'll heat up the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
