Be sure to use a filter to remove any debris that may have entered the water during the refilling process.\n\nFinally, you will need to add a sanitizer to the water to kill any remaining bacteria or other contaminants. This can be done by using a product such as chlorine or bromine, or by using a natural alternative such as hydrogen peroxide or baking soda.\n\nIt is important to note that the specific steps for cleaning a hot tub may vary depending on the model and manufacturer.
