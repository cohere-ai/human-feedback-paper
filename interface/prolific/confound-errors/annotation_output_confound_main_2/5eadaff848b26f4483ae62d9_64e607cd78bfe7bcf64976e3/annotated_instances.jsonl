It is a subset of the Visual Basic programming language, and is designed to be easy to learn and use.\n\nTo begin programming with VBScript, you will need to create a new script file. This can be done by opening a text editor, such as Notepad, and saving the file with a .vbs extension. Once you have created your script file, you can begin adding code to it.\n\nThe basic syntax of VBScript is similar to that of other programming languages, with variables, functions, and loops. You can also use conditional statements, such as if-then-else and switch, to control the flow of your program.\n\nTo interact with the user, you can use the InputBox function to display a dialog box and collect user input. You can also use the MsgBox function to display a message box to the user.\n\nTo access and manipulate files and directories, you can use the FileSystemObject (FSO) object. This object provides a wide range of methods and properties that can be used to read and write files, create and delete directories, and more.\n\nTo access and manipulate databases, you can use the ADO (ActiveX Data Objects) object. This object provides a wide range of methods and properties that can be used to connect to and query databases, as well as to update and delete data.\n\nThese are just a few of the many features of VBScript. With its simple syntax and powerful capabilities, it is a great choice for creating a wide variety of programs."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_141", "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5eadaff848b26f4483ae62d9_64e607cd78bfe7bcf64976e3", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "1"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 30s "}}
