(STEM).\n\nThe main pillar of the investment, which will be officially announced on Tuesday, is a $21 million Australian training program for 100,000 tertiary and school students in STEM related areas.\n\nPitched as a solution to the lag in science and technology innovation in Australia, Cisco's new five-year AUSTEM 2020 program, will accelerate its existing 16-year-old Networking Academy Program, by seeking to train young people at three times the current rate.\n\nKen Boal of Cisco says industry must do more to promote the study of science and technology. Justin McManus\n\nThe scheme will broaden curriculums used at 117 Australian universities, TAFEs and secondary schools, by introducing subjects such as cyber security, cloud and the so-called \"internet of things\".\n\n\"We are the middle of the road for funding and international collaboration, middle of the road for performance in schools, and on science, maths and literacy. And middle of the road just isn't going to cut it if we want to get ahead and maintain our standard of living,\" said Cisco Australia and New Zealand vice-president and Commonwealth Science Council member, Ken Boal.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Cisco is to spend up to $31m on a five-year training program to increase the pool of STEM talent in Australia.", "Response B": "Cisco, a giant in computer networking, has launched a five-year investment program in Australia worth up to $31 million to increase the pool of talent in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).
