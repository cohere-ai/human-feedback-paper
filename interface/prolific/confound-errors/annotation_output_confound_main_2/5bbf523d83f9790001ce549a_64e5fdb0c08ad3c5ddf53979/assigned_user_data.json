{"515": {"id": "515", "text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to keep teens from drinking at a party where alcohol is served?", "Response A": "I\u2019d be happy to try.  I think the single most important thing is to make sure there are plenty of non-alcoholic drinks available, and to make sure that alcohol is not served to anyone underage.  I also think it\u2019s important to provide food, and to encourage people to eat.  This can reduce the impact of alcohol, and also it\u2019s a good way to give people something to do besides drink.  I think it\u2019s also important to plan activities that will keep everyone entertained, so that people aren\u2019t just hanging around drinking.  Finally, I think it\u2019s important to make sure there are plenty of adults around who can keep an eye on things and make sure everyone is OK.", "Response B": "Here are some strategies that may help keep teens from drinking at a party where alcohol is served:\n\n- Set a good example: It is important for parents and caregivers to set a good example for teens by not drinking themselves. This will help to demonstrate that alcohol is not necessary to have a good time and can be dangerous.\n- Talk to your teen: It is important to have open and honest conversations with your teen about the dangers of drinking and the potential consequences of doing so. Encourage them to make informed decisions about their behavior and to be responsible for their actions.\n- Provide alternative activities: If there is no alcohol at the party, try to provide other activities for your teen to participate in, such as games, dancing, or sports. This can help to keep them occupied and prevent them from feeling bored or lonely.\n- Set limits: If you are hosting a party and serving alcohol, it is important to set limits on the amount of alcohol that is served. This will help to prevent teens from overindulging and getting into trouble.\n- Stay involved: If you are not hosting the party, it is important to stay involved in your teen's life and to be aware of their activities. This will help to keep them safe and prevent them from getting into trouble."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 144, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to keep teens from drinking at a party where alcohol is served?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            I\u2019d be happy to try.
