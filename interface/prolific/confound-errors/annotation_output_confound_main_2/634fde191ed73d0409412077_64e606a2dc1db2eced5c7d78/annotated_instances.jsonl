{"id": "249", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to defeat ashnard in fire emblem: path of radiance?", "Response A": "Ashnard is a difficult boss to defeat in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance. To defeat him, you should have a strong army of powerful units. Make sure to bring a healer to heal your units, and use ranged units to attack him from afar. It is also important to use terrain and positioning to your advantage, as Ashnard has high defense and resistance. Additionally, make sure to have a balanced team with a mix of sword, lance, and bow users to deal with Ashnard's different strengths and weaknesses.", "Response B": "Ashnard in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance is a difficult opponent to defeat, but there are some strategies that can help. One approach is to use a combination of magic and physical attacks to weaken him, and then focus on attacking his weaknesses. For example, Ashnard is weak to wind magic, so using a wind mage can be effective. Additionally, his strength is in close combat, so it may be helpful to use ranged attacks to keep him at a distance. Finally, building up your own units with strong defense and healing abilities can help you weather his attacks and eventually defeat him."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 143, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "634fde191ed73d0409412077_64e606a2dc1db2eced5c7d78", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 4s "}}
