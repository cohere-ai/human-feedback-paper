Personal data from thousands of employees was reportedly compromised along with private emails from celebrities and executives.\n\nThe suits were combined into a single class action case. A settlement was reached on Monday. It is now awaiting court approval.\n\nThe agreement was \"mutually agreed upon with the plaintiffs and is an important, positive step forward in putting the cyber-attack firmly behind us,\" Michael Lynton, the studio's CEO, said in a memo to staff on Tuesday.\n\nRelated: Sony: Hack so bad, our computers still don't work\n\nLynton said the proposal extends existing credit and fraud monitoring for employees for two more years.\n\nThe studio \"has emerged from the cyber-attack a stronger company with a smart and strategic vision for the road ahead,\" he wrote. \"We are looking forward, not back, and we are confident and optimistic about our future.\"\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Glaciers in Bolivia are retreating at an alarming rate, causing a number of serious concerns for local communities.  The receding glaciers are creating many new high-altitude lakes which are prone to disastrous outburst floods due to rockfalls, earthquakes and avalanches.  In addition, the melting glacier water is an important source of drinking water and hydroelectric power for many local communities, so the reduced ice coverage will have serious impacts on their water supply.  Overall, the study estimates that the glaciers could shrink by more than 90 percent by 2100, which would have devastating consequences for the local environment and economy.  It is critically important that local communities take steps to prepare for the severe impacts of climate change in the coming years.", "Response B": "Sony Pictures has settled a class-action lawsuit filed by employees who feared identity theft after a major hacking attack last year.
