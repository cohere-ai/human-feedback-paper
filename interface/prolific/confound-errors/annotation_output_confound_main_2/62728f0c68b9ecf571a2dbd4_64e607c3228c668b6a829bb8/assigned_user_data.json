To defeat him, you should have a strong army of powerful units. Make sure to bring a healer to heal your units, and use ranged units to attack him from afar. It is also important to use terrain and positioning to your advantage, as Ashnard has high defense and resistance. Additionally, make sure to have a balanced team with a mix of sword, lance, and bow users to deal with Ashnard's different strengths and weaknesses.", "Response B": "First, you need to get a team of strong units. Second, you need to attack ashnard's weak points. Third, you need to use your units' special moves. Finally, you need to use your units' weapons."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 143, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to defeat ashnard in fire emblem: path of radiance?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Ashnard is a difficult boss to defeat in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance.
