To draw Deadpool you need a piece of paper, a pencil, and a drawing tool, such as a pen or a marker.  You should also have some reference material, such as a photo or a drawing of Deadpool, to make sure you get his face and costume right.  First you\u2019ll need to draw a rough outline of Deadpool\u2019s head and torso.  Then you can add details like his eyes, mouth, and costume.  You might want to draw Deadpool in a few different poses, to capture him in motion.  When you\u2019re happy with your drawing, you can add color with pens or markers, or you can leave your drawing in pencil form.
