{"id": "412", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to jog in cold weather?", "Response A": "Sure! Here are a few tips for jogging in cold weather:\n\n- Dress in layers, so that you can adjust your clothing as needed.\n- Wear a hat and gloves to protect your head and hands from the cold.\n- Run in the morning or evening, when the air is usually warmer.\n- Use a treadmill or other indoor exercise equipment if you don't want to risk getting sick from the cold.\n- Stay hydrated and drink plenty of water before, during, and after your run.\n- Avoid running in very cold weather if possible, as it can be dangerous and cause hypothermia or frostbite.", "Response B": "Sure! When jogging in cold weather, it's important to dress warmly. Wear layers, such as a base layer, a second layer, and a third layer. The base layer should be made of a material that wicks away sweat, while the second and third layers should be made of warm, insulating materials. It's also important to protect your head, hands, and feet, as these areas are prone to getting cold. Use gloves, a hat, and warm socks. Finally, be sure to warm up before you start jogging and cool down after you finish. This will prevent muscle strain and injuries."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 127, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5a89cc2c000dab00018cbd38_64e600f35a348aa76c17b5a7", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 36s "}}
