I can help you find themes for your Tumblr.", "Response B": "Eyebrow microblading is a procedure that involves using a small handheld tool to deposit pigment into the skin. The tool is used to create thin, hair-like strokes that mimic the look of real eyebrows. The procedure is typically done by a trained professional and can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours. \n\nTo get eyebrow microblading, you will need to book an appointment with a trained professional. You will also need to choose a color that matches your natural eyebrows. \n\nDuring the procedure, the professional will use the small handheld tool to deposit pigment into the skin. The tool is used to create thin, hair-like strokes that mimic the look of real eyebrows. The procedure is typically done in several sessions, with the first session taking the longest. \n\nAfter the procedure, you may experience some redness and swelling in the area. This is normal and should subside within a few days. You will also need to avoid touching the area too much, as this can cause the pigment to spread. \n\nYou should see results immediately after the procedure, but the final results will not be visible for several weeks. The color will appear more intense at first, but it will fade over time. You may need to schedule touch-up sessions to maintain the results. \n\nOverall, eyebrow microblading is a safe and effective procedure that can help you achieve the perfect eyebrows. However, it is important to choose a trained professional and follow the aftercare instructions carefully to ensure the best results."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": "distractor_130", "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "634265d4ff46e9c74d9fe152_64e60c37411e8e7586948c3b", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "n/a", "factors_b": "n/a", "feedback": "\"A\" is simply an off-topic response while \"B\" address the prompt head-on with reasonable length and could satisfy most users with its detail on the most common intent of the prompt being about eyebrow aspect."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 37s "}}
