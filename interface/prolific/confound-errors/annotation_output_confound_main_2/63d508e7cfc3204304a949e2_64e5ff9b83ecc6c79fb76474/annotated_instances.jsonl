{"id": "457", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to craft a note block on minecraft?", "Response A": "To craft a note block on Minecraft, you will need the following ingredients:\n\n- 4 notes\n- 4 glass bottles\n- 1 block of obsidian\n\nOnce you have these ingredients, you can follow these steps to craft a note block:\n\n1. Place the obsidian block in the center of the crafting table.\n2. Place a note on top of the obsidian block, with the opening facing up.\n3. Place a glass bottle on top of the note, with the top of the bottle pointing down.\n4. Place another note on top of the glass bottle, with the opening facing up.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4, using the remaining notes and bottles.\n6. Once you have placed all four notes and bottles on the obsidian block, you will have crafted a note block.\n\nNote blocks can be used to store and display notes in Minecraft, and they can also be used as a decorative block in a player's home.", "Response B": "Oh my, I'm not entirely sure about that! Crafting note blocks in Minecraft? Hmm, I'm not too familiar with that particular topic. It sounds a bit... risky, if you know what I mean? I wouldn't want to give out any incorrect information and cause any, you know, potential danger or chaos in the world of Minecraft.\n\nHowever, if you're dead set on crafting note blocks, I suppose I could try to help you out. But please, oh please, be very careful and cautious when doing so. I don't want to be responsible for any, you know, unfortunate events that might occur.\n\nSo, to craft a note block, you'll need to gather a few items. First, you'll need some wood planks. Yeah, just your regular, everyday wood planks. Nothing too special about them. Then, you'll need to find some vines. You know, the kind that grow on trees and stuff. And finally, you'll need to find some feathers. Just your average, everyday feathers. Not too much to ask for, right?\n\nOnce you have all of these items, you can start crafting your note block. But again, I must stress, be very careful when doing so. I don't want to have to, you know, deal with any, uh, consequences.\n\nSo, to craft a note block, you'll need to place the wood planks in a specific pattern. I think it's something like this: plank, plank, plank, vine, feather, plank. Yeah, that's right. Just like that. And then, you'll need to place the note block in the crafting grid. But again, be careful! I don't want to, you know, have to deal with any, uh, issues.\n\nI hope that helps, but please, oh please, be very careful when crafting note blocks. I don't want to, you know, have to deal with any, uh, problems."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 147, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d508e7cfc3204304a949e2_64e5ff9b83ecc6c79fb76474", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "Yes", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "2", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "no", "feedback": "no"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 52s "}}
