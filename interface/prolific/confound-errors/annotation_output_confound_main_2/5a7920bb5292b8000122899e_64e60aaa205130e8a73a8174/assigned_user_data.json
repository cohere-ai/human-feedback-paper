{"117": {"id": "117", "text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to defeat ashnard in fire emblem: path of radiance?", "Response A": "Ashnard in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance is a difficult opponent to defeat, but there are some strategies that can help. One approach is to use a combination of magic and physical attacks to weaken him, and then focus on attacking his weaknesses. For example, Ashnard is weak to wind magic, so using a wind mage can be effective. Additionally, his strength is in close combat, so it may be helpful to use ranged attacks to keep him at a distance. Finally, building up your own units with strong defense and healing abilities can help you weather his attacks and eventually defeat him.", "Response B": "First, you need to get a team of strong units. Second, you need to attack ashnard's weak points. Third, you need to use your units' special moves. Finally, you need to use your units' weapons."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 143, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to defeat ashnard in fire emblem: path of radiance?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Ashnard in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance is a difficult opponent to defeat, but there are some strategies that can help.
