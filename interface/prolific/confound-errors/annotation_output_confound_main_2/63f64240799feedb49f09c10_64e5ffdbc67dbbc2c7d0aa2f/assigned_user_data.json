To draw Deadpool you need a piece of paper, a pencil, and a drawing tool, such as a pen or a marker.  You should also have some reference material, such as a photo or a drawing of Deadpool, to make sure you get his face and costume right.  First you\u2019ll need to draw a rough outline of Deadpool\u2019s head and torso.  Then you can add details like his eyes, mouth, and costume.  You might want to draw Deadpool in a few different poses, to capture him in motion.
