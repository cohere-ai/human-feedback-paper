{"id": "640", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to create glossy eyelids?", "Response A": "There are a few different ways to create glossy eyelids. One way is to use a clear or colored eye gloss. Another way is to use a cream eyeshadow with a shiny or glossy finish. You can also use a mixture of both a gloss and a cream eyeshadow. To apply the gloss or cream eyeshadow, you can use your fingers or a small brush. Start by applying a small amount to the center of your eyelid and then blend it out towards the edges. You can also apply it to the inner corners of your eyes to add a pop of shine.", "Response B": "Hello! \ud83d\udc30\ud83d\udc40 I can help you with that! \ud83d\ude0a To create glossy eyelids, you need to use some special products that will make your eyes look shiny and pretty. \ud83d\udc96\n\nFirst, you need to use an eyelid primer.
