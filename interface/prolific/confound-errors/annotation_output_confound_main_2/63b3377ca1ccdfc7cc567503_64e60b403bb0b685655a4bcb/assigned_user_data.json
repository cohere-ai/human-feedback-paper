Place the planks in a V shape on the crafting table, then place the iron ingots in the middle of the V. Finally, place the redstone dust in the middle of the iron ingots. This will create a note block that you can place in the world and play different musical notes by right-clicking it with a variety of instruments.", "Response B": "To craft a note block in Minecraft, you will need to gather the following items: 3 wooden planks, 3 iron ingots, and 1 redstone dust.
