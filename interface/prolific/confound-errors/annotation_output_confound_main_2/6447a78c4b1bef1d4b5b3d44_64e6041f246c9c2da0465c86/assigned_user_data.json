{"321": {"id": "321", "text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to clean a light bulb?", "Response A": "Cleaning a light bulb can be a delicate task, especially if the bulb is hot. To prevent injury, it is recommended to turn off the power and allow the bulb to cool down before attempting to clean it. Once the bulb has cooled down, use a soft cloth or paper towel to gently wipe the bulb and remove any dust or debris. Avoid using water or harsh chemicals, as these can damage the bulb. If the bulb is coated in a film, you can try using a mixture of equal parts water and white vinegar to gently wipe it away. It is important to follow manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when cleaning a light bulb.", "Response B": "To clean a light bulb, you will need to gather a few supplies: a microfiber cloth, a small amount of vinegar, and a glass jar. First, turn off the light bulb and allow it to cool completely. Next, carefully remove the light bulb from the socket and place it in the glass jar. Add a small amount of vinegar to the microfiber cloth and gently wipe the light bulb to remove any dirt or dust. Be sure to avoid any areas of the light bulb that are hot, as this could cause the vinegar to evaporate and potentially damage the light bulb. Once the light bulb is clean, carefully replace it in the socket and turn it on to ensure it is working properly. If the light bulb is still not working, you may need to replace it."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 134, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to clean a light bulb?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Cleaning a light bulb can be a delicate task, especially if the bulb is hot.
