Rinse the sloe berries and prick them with a skewer. Place them in a sterilized jar or bottle and add the caster sugar. Pour the gin over the berries and sugar, seal the bottle or jar, and shake well. Store the bottle in a cool, dark place for 2 to 3 months, shaking it occasionally. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve or muslin cloth to remove the berries and any sediment. Serve chilled."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 125, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "64063cb9ad66c9a964814b0e_64e60487d9c661fc828b6867", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 51s "}}
