File a claim with the court.  This involves filling out some paperwork, and paying a filing fee.\n2.  Serve the defendant with a copy of the claim.  This involves giving the defendant notice of the claim, so that they have an opportunity to respond.\n3.  Attend a hearing, where the judge will decide the case.

If you win the case, the judge will award you a judgment, which is a legal decision ordering the defendant to pay you.
