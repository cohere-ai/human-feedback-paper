Add a charm to your bracelet for each important event or accomplishment in your life.\n\n4.   Keep adding charms until your bracelet is full.", "Response B": "Sure, I can tell you how to create a charm bracelet to tell your story. The first step is to choose some charms that are meaningful to you. These can be things like symbols, stones, or objects that represent important people or events in your life. Once you've chosen your charms, you'll need to attach them to a bracelet. You can do this by opening up each charm and using small jewelry pliers to attach them to the bracelet. Once you've attached all of your charms, you can close up the bracelet and wear it to tell your story!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 135, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5ffb432901d8311622530a52_64e5f6c67b8db5f242987a08", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No", "feedback": "None"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 38s "}}
