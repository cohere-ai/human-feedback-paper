{"id": "39", "input_text": {"Prompt": "In the U.S., the results of field trials, conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), show that a common neonicotinoid called imidacloprid leads to hive populations declining. The study showed when the pesticide was used at the lower end of the spectrum, around 25 parts per billion in the nectar and pollen of the plants, it was sufficient enough to cause a reduction in the hive population. It is thought the chemical affects certain parts of the bee's brain where sensory information related to orientation is stored.\n\nSpeaking with The Guardian, Jim Jones, the EPA's assistant administrator for chemical safety and pollution prevention noted: \"This is a pretty big step forward in increasing our understanding of the potential for imidacloprids to impact colony health.\"\n\nNeonicotinoid pesticides are controversial products, given the scientific evidence concerning the impact on pollinating insects, such as bees and butterflies. The subject has been featured by Digital Journal several times over the past few years. The pesticides are currently banned in most parts of the European Union. Here the U.K. has opted out and permits the use of the pesticides in selected farms. The intended use here is to kill aphids; however, many biologists are concerned about the impact on bee populations.\n\nWith the European Union situation, European Food Safety Authority has commenced a review that could lead to the ending of the ban in relation to three neonicotinoid pesticides. The pesticides being considered are thiamethoxam, clothianidin and imidacloprid. These pesticides are made by companies like Bayer Crop Science.\n\nCentral to the review will be whether or not bees are affected. The plight of bees is very serious. In Europe, more than a quarter of Europe's bumblebees and one in 10 of all honeybees faces extinction.\n\nFranziska Achterberg, Greenpeace EU's food policy director, is concerned about the outcome, especially if there is a relaxation in the advice about pesticide use. Speaking with The Guardian, Achterberg noted: \"The pesticides industry has lobbied hard for these standards to be rejected. But the EU has a legal mandate to protect bees from harmful pesticides, and a solid risk assessment is the basis for that.\"\n\nThe outcome of the review is expected within the next few weeks.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The article discusses the impact of neonicotinoid pesticides on bee populations, particularly in the European Union. Despite the ban on the use of these pesticides in many parts of the European Union, there are concerns that the ban may be lifted. This has sparked controversy among environmentalists and biologists, who are concerned about the impact on bee populations. The article also discusses the outcome of a field trial conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which found that the use of neonicotinoid pesticides at the lower end of the spectrum can lead to a reduction in hive population. The article concludes by noting the upcoming review of the ban on neonicotinoid pesticides by the European Food Safety Authority, and the concerns of environmental groups and scientists about the potential outcome.", "Response B": "Bees are dying at alarming rates and several parts of the world have banned pesticides that are contributing to the problem. But now a review is being conducted to potentially allow those pesticides back into the market. This is really concerning since the science showing these pesticides harm bees was the basis for the original ban."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 132, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "64294e2b5234fdc8f81ffe6a_64e601b0013ead6a0db7e7fc", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "Yes", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "2", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "No", "feedback": "None"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 34s "}}
