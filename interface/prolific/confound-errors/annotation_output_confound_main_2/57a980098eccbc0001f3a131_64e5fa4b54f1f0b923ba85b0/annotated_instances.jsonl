{"id": "61", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make sloe gin?", "Response A": "Certainly! Here's a recipe for making sloe gin:\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 lb (450 g) sloes\n- 1 bottle gin\n- 1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar\n\nInstructions:\n1. Wash the sloes and remove any stems.\n2. Put the sloes and sugar in a large glass jar or ceramic container.\n3. Pour in the bottle of gin and stir until the sugar dissolves.\n4. Cover the jar with a tight-fitting lid and store it in a cool, dark place for 3 months, shaking it occasionally to help the flavors meld together.\n5. Strain the gin through a fine-mesh sieve and discard the sloes.\n6. Pour the gin back into the original bottle, or into a clean, sterilized bottle.\n7. Serve chilled.\n\nNote: The longer you let the sloe gin sit, the more complex the flavors will become. You can also add additional ingredients such as orange peel or cinnamon sticks to add depth of flavor. Enjoy!", "Response B": "To make sloe gin, you will need 450 grams of sloe berries, 70 grams of caster sugar, and 1 liter of gin. Rinse the sloe berries and prick them with a skewer. Place them in a sterilized jar or bottle and add the caster sugar. Pour the gin over the berries and sugar, seal the bottle or jar, and shake well. Store the bottle in a cool, dark place for 2 to 3 months, shaking it occasionally. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve or muslin cloth to remove the berries and any sediment. Serve chilled."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 125, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "57a980098eccbc0001f3a131_64e5fa4b54f1f0b923ba85b0", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 44s "}}
