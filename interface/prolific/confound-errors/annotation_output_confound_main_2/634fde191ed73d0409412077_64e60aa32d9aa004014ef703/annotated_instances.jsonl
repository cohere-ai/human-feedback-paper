A 24 hour gaming marathon is a really fun activity, though it\u2019s pretty difficult.  To do it, you\u2019ll need to find a group of friends that are also interested in doing a 24 hour gaming marathon, since it\u2019s a lot of fun but also pretty challenging.  You\u2019ll want to prepare plenty of food and drinks to keep you going, and make sure you\u2019re well rested before you begin.  The actual marathon consists of playing a video game for 24 hours straight, taking breaks only to eat, sleep, or use the bathroom.

Good luck!", "Response B": "Sure! A 24-hour gaming marathon is a challenge in which a person plays video games for 24 hours straight. It's a very popular event, and there are many different ways to participate. Some people choose to play a single game, while others choose to play a variety of games. Some people even choose to play a game with a group of friends.\n\nIt's a great way to challenge yourself and have fun, but it's important to remember that it's not for everyone. If you're not used to playing games for long periods of time, it can be very tiring and even stressful. It's also important to remember that you should take breaks and eat healthy foods to stay energized.\n\nSo, if you're thinking about doing a 24-hour gaming marathon, it's important to do your research and be prepared."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 128, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "634fde191ed73d0409412077_64e60aa32d9aa004014ef703", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 59s "}}
