A 24 hour gaming marathon is a really fun activity, though it\u2019s pretty difficult.  To do it, you\u2019ll need to find a group of friends that are also interested in doing a 24 hour gaming marathon, since it\u2019s a lot of fun but also pretty challenging.  You\u2019ll want to prepare plenty of food and drinks to keep you going, and make sure you\u2019re well rested before you begin.  The actual marathon consists of playing a video game for 24 hours straight, taking breaks only to eat, sleep, or use the bathroom.  You\u2019ll want to find a game that you really enjoy, that is easy to pick up and put down, and that has plenty of content so that it will keep you interested for 24 hours.  Some popular games for this are Zelda, Super Mario Bros., and Minecraft.  You\u2019ll also want to set up your space so that you\u2019re comfortable, and you\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re not disturbed by anyone else during the marathon.
