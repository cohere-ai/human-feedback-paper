However, some possible strategies that could be effective include:\n\n- Recognizing the behavior: It is important to be aware of the signs of backstabbing and to recognize when it is happening. This can help you to take steps to address the situation and protect yourself.\n- Setting boundaries: It is important to set clear boundaries with people who are backstabbing you. This may involve limiting your interactions with them, setting limits on what you are willing to discuss with them, or cutting off contact altogether.\n- Seeking support: It can be helpful to talk to a trusted friend or family member about what is happening. They can provide support and help you to figure out the best way to deal with the situation.\n- Seeking professional help: If you are struggling to cope with the situation on your own, it may be helpful to seek the guidance of a mental health professional. They can provide support and help you to develop strategies for dealing with backstabbers.", "Response B": "Ah, the pernicious and insidious phenomenon of backstabbers! These individuals, who masquerade as allies and confidants, yet perpetrate acts of betrayal and duplicity, can be a formidable challenge to navigate. As an empathetic and erudite assistant, I shall offer a comprehensive and multifaceted strategy for dealing with these parasitic personalities.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is essential to acknowledge the emotional toll that backstabbers can inflict upon their victims. The sense of violation, the erosion of trust, and the emotional exhaustion that ensues from such betrayals can be profoundly debilitating. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize self-care, seek support from trusted individuals, and engage in therapeutic modalities that foster emotional resilience and healing.\n\nTo effectively address the issue of backstabbers, we must adopt a multifaceted approach that incorporates both cognitive and behavioral strategies. On the cognitive front, it is essential to develop a nuanced understanding of the motivations and tactics employed by backstabbers. These individuals often exploit vulnerabilities and insecurities, employing manipulation and deceit to further their own agendas. By recognizing these patterns and anticipating their tactics, you can better navigate these situations with a degree of emotional detachment and critical thinking.\n\nIn terms of behavioral strategies, it is crucial to establish and maintain healthy boundaries. This encompasses communicating your expectations, needs, and preferences clearly and assertively, while also being mindful of the potential consequences of your actions. Moreover, it is essential to cultivate a support network of trusted individuals who can provide emotional validation and guidance.\n\nIn addition to these cognitive and behavioral strategies, there are also several technical terms that can prove useful in dealing with backstabbers. For instance, the concept of \" gaslighting\" - a form of manipulation where an individual makes someone question their own sanity or memory - is a common tactic employed by backstabbers. By recognizing this pattern and employing coping mechanisms, such as seeking external validation and maintaining a record of events, you can mitigate the impact of such tactics."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 146, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to deal with backstabbers?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            It is difficult to give a general answer to this question as everyone may have different experiences and ways of dealing with backstabbers.
