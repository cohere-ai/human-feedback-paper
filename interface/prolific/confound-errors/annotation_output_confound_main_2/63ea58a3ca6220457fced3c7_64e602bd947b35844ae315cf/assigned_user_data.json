This will help to demonstrate that alcohol is not necessary to have a good time and can be dangerous.\n- Talk to your teen: It is important to have open and honest conversations with your teen about the dangers of drinking and the potential consequences of doing so. Encourage them to make informed decisions about their behavior and to be responsible for their actions.\n- Provide alternative activities: If there is no alcohol at the party, try to provide other activities for your teen to participate in, such as games, dancing, or sports. This can help to keep them occupied and prevent them from feeling bored or lonely.\n- Set limits: If you are hosting a party and serving alcohol, it is important to set limits on the amount of alcohol that is served. This will help to prevent teens from overindulging and getting into trouble.\n- Stay involved: If you are not hosting the party, it is important to stay involved in your teen's life and to be aware of their activities.
