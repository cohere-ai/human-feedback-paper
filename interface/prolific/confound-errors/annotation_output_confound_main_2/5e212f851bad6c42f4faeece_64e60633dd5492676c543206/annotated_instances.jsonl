Good luck!", "Response B": "Sure, here are some steps to follow to collect on a debt in small claims court:  \n\n1.  File a claim with the court.  This involves filling out some paperwork, and paying a filing fee.\n2.  Serve the defendant with a copy of the claim.  This involves giving the defendant notice of the claim, so that they have an opportunity to respond.\n3.  Attend a hearing, where the judge will decide the case.  You and the defendant will both have an opportunity to present evidence and argue your case.\n4.  If you win the case, the judge will award you a judgment, which is a legal decision ordering the defendant to pay you.  You can then try to collect on the judgment by asking the court to enforce it, or by trying to collect on your own."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 142, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5e212f851bad6c42f4faeece_64e60633dd5492676c543206", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "Yes", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "Yes", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "no", "feedback": "B is straight to the point"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 57s "}}
