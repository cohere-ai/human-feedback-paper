{"id": "540", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to deal with backstabbers?", "Response A": "It will be difficult for the backstabber to respond to you in the same manner, as it will make them appear childish. Additionally, try to avoid situations where the backstabber may be present. They may not change their behavior, but by avoiding them, you can reduce the amount of stress and frustration they cause you.", "Response B": "It is difficult to give a general answer to this question as everyone may have different experiences and ways of dealing with backstabbers. However, some possible strategies that could be effective include:\n\n- Recognizing the behavior: It is important to be aware of the signs of backstabbing and to recognize when it is happening. This can help you to take steps to address the situation and protect yourself.\n- Setting boundaries: It is important to set clear boundaries with people who are backstabbing you. This may involve limiting your interactions with them, setting limits on what you are willing to discuss with them, or cutting off contact altogether.\n- Seeking support: It can be helpful to talk to a trusted friend or family member about what is happening. They can provide support and help you to figure out the best way to deal with the situation.\n- Seeking professional help: If you are struggling to cope with the situation on your own, it may be helpful to seek the guidance of a mental health professional. They can provide support and help you to develop strategies for dealing with backstabbers."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 146, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "634fde191ed73d0409412077_64e5fca5381eb08ae1997e71", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 1s "}}
