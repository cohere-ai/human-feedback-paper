Whether you are playing golf, tennis, skiing, or kiteboarding, this new technology will help you get better in any sport\n\nUntil now, sports wearables have largely boiled down to high-tech sensors recording basic data. With the addition of GAIA Intelligence, the company will be able to make the PIQ Robot that much better at improving your performance.\n\nBoth the PIQ Robot and GAIA Intelligence give coaches and athletes the ability to analyze every movement during a game or match. This data can then be compared with any previous performances as well as with a community's performance overall. The system will highlight key improvements to focus on for success.\n\nThe French startup has one of the most powerful wearable sensors on the market. The PIQ Robot captures and analyzes more than thousands of data points to measure speed, strength, and precision.\n\nTo better understand and analyze sports movements, GAIA was developed. Using various motion-capture algorithms, the software is able to break down body movement related to a specific sport. GAIA will continue to learn from your movement each time you use the PIQ Robot. To give the artificial intelligence a head start, GAIA has been analyzing millions of movements from thousands of other athletes.\n\n\"With GAIA and the Winning Factors, sports wearables enter a new paradigm,\"CEO C\u00e9dric Mangaud said in a statement. \"Our technology enables athletes, not only to measure their performance but also to benefit from personalized advice and get closer to victory. Our goal is now to integrate this technology in sports devices to offer athletes a fully integrated experience.\"\n\nIf you already own a PIQ Robot, don't worry about ordering a new one. A free software update will bring GAIA to all current users. PIQ wants to make sure that everyone has the ability to improve their performance.\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The sportswear start-up PIQ has launched a software update to its PIQ robot device, adding artificial intelligence to its wearable tech.
