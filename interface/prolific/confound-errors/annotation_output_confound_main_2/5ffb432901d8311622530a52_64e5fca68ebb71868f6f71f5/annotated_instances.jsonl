{"id": "542", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Dive Brief:\n\nInside Higher Ed has produced its annual Survey of Faculty Attitudes on Technology, which reveals a large pool of dissatisfaction among professors about the value of technology in teaching and learning.\n\nA majority of those faculty surveyed said it is harder to justify technology investments because the student outcomes aren't matching the inputs, most faculty members do not discuss scholarship on social media, and that only a third of faculty members say they are included on decisions about how to use data mining services and applications.\n\nProfessors also indicated that they recognize the evolution of scholarly journals moving to open-access formats, but say that they fear peer-review is in jeopardy as a result.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe divided embrace of technology by faculty is an age-old challenge in higher education, but sharply contrasts other surveys suggesting that faculty members understand, and even expect for institutions to mandate technological development. In the end, executives have to help faculty to realize how tech integration efforts, training, and usage for teaching and learning all come together to improve the academic enterprise.\n\nWithout tech infusion, there is little room to expand foundations for competency-based education, innovations in distance learning, or assessment to ensure that different kinds of students are primed for success. The culture should not be one of faculty reacting negatively to technology as a hindrance, but leadership positively promoting it as an asset in the work environment.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Sure, here is a summary of the article you provided, written in a technical and complex language, using long words and specialized terms:\n\nThe Inside Higher Ed Survey of Faculty Attitudes on Technology has revealed a noteworthy dichotomy in the perception of technology among faculty members, wherein a substantial portion of respondents expressed skepticism regarding the efficacy of technology in enhancing teaching and learning processes, while others acknowledged the potential benefits of technological integration.\n\nThe findings highlighted that a significant proportion of faculty members encounter challenges in justifying investments in technology due to the perceived lack of commensurate student outcomes, and that only a third of respondents reported being included in decision-making processes related to the utilization of data mining tools and applications.\n\nMoreover, the survey indicated that faculty members are cognizant of the trend towards open-access scholarly journals, but express apprehensions about the potential compromise of peer-review standards in the process.\n\nThe disparity between faculty attitudes towards technology and the perceived need for technological advancements in higher education institutions poses a challenge for institutional leaders, who must facilitate the integration of technology in a manner that addresses the concerns of faculty members while promoting the academic enterprise.\n\nTo address this challenge, executives must adopt a proactive approach that emphasizes the value of technology in enhancing teaching and learning processes, and provides faculty members with the necessary training and support to effectively utilize technology in their academic endeavors.\n\nBy fostering a culture that views technology as an indispensable asset, rather than a hindrance, institutions can leverage technological advancements to expand the scope of competency-based education, innovate distance learning methods, and implement effective assessment strategies to ensure student success.\n\nIn conclusion, the Survey of Faculty Attitudes on Technology highlights the need for institutional leaders to address the disparity in faculty attitudes towards technology and provide the necessary support to facilitate the integration of technology in a manner that enhances the academic enterprise. By doing so, institutions can harness the potential of technology to improve teaching and learning processes, and ensure the success of their students.", "Response B": "This article highlights the divided embrace of technology by faculty in higher education. Faculty members recognize that technology is important, but they are dissatisfied with the value of technology in teaching and learning. The article surveys professors who say that it is harder to justify technology investments because the student outcomes don't match the inputs, and that they are not included on decisions about how to use data mining services and applications. Despite this, professors recognize the evolution of scholarly journals moving to open-access formats. The article emphasizes that institutions must help faculty to realize how technology infusion improves the academic enterprise."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 142, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5ffb432901d8311622530a52_64e5fca68ebb71868f6f71f5", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No", "feedback": "None"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 13s "}}
