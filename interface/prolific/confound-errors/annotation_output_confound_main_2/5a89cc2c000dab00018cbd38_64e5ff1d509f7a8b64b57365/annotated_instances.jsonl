Despite its manageability, it still claims thousands of lives every year. However, a new wearable device called CoughAware may help change that. Developed by Quvium, a medical device company, CoughAware is a neck-worn device that listens for coughs and alerts the wearer, parent, or carer when it detects potential asthma attacks. The device can also identify other respiratory conditions like cystic fibrosis and COPD.\n\nIn a case study, CoughAware was found to significantly reduce the number of days missed due to asthma attacks in children. With 8 million people diagnosed with asthma in the UK alone, and the disease costing the NHS \u00a31 billion per year, CoughAware could be a game-changer. By detecting potential asthma attacks early, the device could help prevent asthma-related deaths, which currently stand at around 1,200 per year.\n\nCoughAware works by analyzing cough sounds and monitoring the wearer's breathing patterns. It can detect early signs of an asthma attack, such as changes in breathing patterns and cough frequencies, and alert the user or their carer before the attack becomes severe. This allows for early intervention and prevention of the attack from progressing.\n\nThe device also has the potential to improve the lives of those with other respiratory conditions. For example, cystic fibrosis patients can use the device to monitor their lung function and detect any changes in their condition.\n\nIn conclusion, CoughAware is a revolutionary wearable device that has the potential to improve the lives of millions of people worldwide. Its ability to detect potential asthma attacks early and alert the user or carer could help prevent asthma-related deaths and improve the quality of life for those with asthma and other respiratory conditions. With its non-invasive and easy-to-use design, CoughAware is an exciting development in the field of respiratory health.", "Response B": "Sure!
