Light bulbs are delicate and their filaments are not designed to be cleaned or maintained in the same way that other household items might be.\n\nInstead of cleaning the light bulb itself, you might consider replacing it if it is no longer functioning properly or if it has reached the end of its recommended lifespan.

Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.", "Response B": "Of course!

Reference images: Gather photos of your dog from different angles and lighting conditions to use as reference.\n5.

Here are the steps to follow:\n\nStep 1: Sketch the basic shape of your dog\n\nBegin by sketching the basic shape of your dog onto your canvas or paper.
