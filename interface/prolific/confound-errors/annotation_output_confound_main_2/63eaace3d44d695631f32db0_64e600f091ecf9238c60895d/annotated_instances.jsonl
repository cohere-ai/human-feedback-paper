{"id": "411", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to paint a portrait of a dog?", "Response A": "Sure, I can give you some pointers.  First, you\u2019ll need to choose the dog you want to paint, and take some photos of it.  Then you\u2019ll need to get some paints and paintbrushes, and some paper to paint on.  You can use acrylic paint, since it\u2019s easy to work with and it dries quickly.  You\u2019ll also need a palette to mix the paint on, and some water.  Then you\u2019ll want to draw a sketch of the dog on the paper, using charcoal or a pencil.", "Response B": "To paint a portrait of a dog, you will need to first choose a reference photo of the dog. Then, sketch out the outline of the dog's head and body on your canvas or paper. Next, begin to fill in the details with your chosen paint colors. Pay attention to the dog's facial features, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. Don't forget to include any unique markings or characteristics that make your dog stand out. Finally, add finishing touches such as a background or collar. Remember to take breaks and step back to evaluate your work as you go. Good luck!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 126, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63eaace3d44d695631f32db0_64e600f091ecf9238c60895d", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "Yes", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "no"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 55s "}}
