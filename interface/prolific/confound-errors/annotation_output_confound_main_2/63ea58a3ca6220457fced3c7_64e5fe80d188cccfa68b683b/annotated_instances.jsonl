To access this section, you will need to speak to Professor Oak in the Unova region. He will give you a special key that will allow you to access the Regirock, Regice, and Regice's Abilities section of the Pok\u00e9dex.\n\nOnce you have the key, you will need to speak to the Regirock, Regice, and Regice trainers in the Unova region. They will give you a special item that will allow you to access the Regi Pok\u00e9mon's Abilities section of the Pok\u00e9dex.\n\nFrom there, you can use the Regi Pok\u00e9mon's Abilities section of the Pok\u00e9dex to find the Regi Pok\u00e9mon. You can also use the Regi Pok\u00e9mon's Abilities section of the Pok\u00e9dex to learn more about the Regi Pok\u00e9mon's abilities and how to use them.\n\nIt's important to note that the Regi Pok\u00e9mon are rare and difficult to find, so you may need to use a combination of the Regi Pok\u00e9mon's Abilities section of the Pok\u00e9dex and the Regirock, Regice, and Regice trainers in the Unova region to find the Regi Pok\u00e9mon.", "Response B": "Sure, the Regis in Pokemon Emerald are Regice, Regirock and Registeel, which are three legendary Pokemon. They are ice, rock and steel types respectively. The three Regis are the leaders of the three teams in the Hoenn region, which are Team Aqua, Team Magma and Team Galactic. The Regis are very powerful and they each hold a special crystal that gives them their power. To defeat the Regis, you first have to defeat the leaders of each team and then they will combine their power to form the Regis. To defeat the Regis, you have to figure out a way to break their crystals and then they will be weakened and you can defeat them."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 132, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63ea58a3ca6220457fced3c7_64e5fe80d188cccfa68b683b", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "Good ", "factors_b": "Good "}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 13s "}}
