This seems to be a decal for a helmet, vehicle or piece of equipment, made of reflective vinyl.  It has some kind of Maltese Cross design with axes, and is made by a company called \u201cFirefighters Sister\u201d.  I did find one online review that stated the product was of \u201cengineer grade quality\u201d, but I don\u2019t know what that means.  Overall this seems like a high quality product, but I am not qualified to write a good product description for it.", "Response B": "This item is a reflective Maltese cross decal with axes, measuring 6 inches in height.  It is manufactured from high-performance retro-reflective vinyl, which is an engineer grade quality vinyl that meets the ASTM 4956-99 specifications, and which provides superior durability and reflectivity.  The decal features a firefighter Maltese cross design, with axes on each arm of the cross, and is suitable for application on a firefighter's helmet, vehicle or other equipment.  The reflective qualities of the decal allow the colors to reflect when light hits them, providing enhanced visibility and safety."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "amazon", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 136, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d06743eac143b000118ce79_64e60b4084f955159c8574c4", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "no"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 49s "}}
