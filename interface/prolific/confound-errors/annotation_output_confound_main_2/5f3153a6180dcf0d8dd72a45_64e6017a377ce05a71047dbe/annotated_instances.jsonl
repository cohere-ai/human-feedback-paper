Ashnard is a powerful enemy in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, and he's definitely not going to be easy to defeat. However, if you're able to use the right strategies and tactics, you should be able to take him down.\n\nOne of the key things you need to do in order to defeat Ashnard is to use your party's strength and weaknesses to your advantage. For example, if you have a character with high strength and defense, you can use them to take down Ashnard's physical attacks. If you have a character with high magic and resistance, you can use them to take down Ashnard's magical attacks.\n\nYou also need to be careful about when you use your party's abilities. For example, if you have a character with a powerful ability that can take down an enemy, you should use it when you have the opportunity to do so. However, you also need to be careful not to use it too early, or else you may not have enough time to use it again later in the fight.\n\nOverall, defeating Ashnard in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance will take some strategic thinking and careful planning. However, if you're able to use the right strategies and tactics, you should be able to take him down and win the fight.", "Response B": "First, you need to get a team of strong units.
