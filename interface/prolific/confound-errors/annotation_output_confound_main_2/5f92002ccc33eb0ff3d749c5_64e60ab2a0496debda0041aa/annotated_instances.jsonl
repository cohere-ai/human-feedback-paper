{"id": "116", "input_text": {"Prompt": "In the U.S., the results of field trials, conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), show that a common neonicotinoid called imidacloprid leads to hive populations declining. The study showed when the pesticide was used at the lower end of the spectrum, around 25 parts per billion in the nectar and pollen of the plants, it was sufficient enough to cause a reduction in the hive population. It is thought the chemical affects certain parts of the bee's brain where sensory information related to orientation is stored.\n\nSpeaking with The Guardian, Jim Jones, the EPA's assistant administrator for chemical safety and pollution prevention noted: \"This is a pretty big step forward in increasing our understanding of the potential for imidacloprids to impact colony health.\"\n\nNeonicotinoid pesticides are controversial products, given the scientific evidence concerning the impact on pollinating insects, such as bees and butterflies. The subject has been featured by Digital Journal several times over the past few years. The pesticides are currently banned in most parts of the European Union. Here the U.K. has opted out and permits the use of the pesticides in selected farms. The intended use here is to kill aphids; however, many biologists are concerned about the impact on bee populations.\n\nWith the European Union situation, European Food Safety Authority has commenced a review that could lead to the ending of the ban in relation to three neonicotinoid pesticides. The pesticides being considered are thiamethoxam, clothianidin and imidacloprid. These pesticides are made by companies like Bayer Crop Science.\n\nCentral to the review will be whether or not bees are affected. The plight of bees is very serious. In Europe, more than a quarter of Europe's bumblebees and one in 10 of all honeybees faces extinction.\n\nFranziska Achterberg, Greenpeace EU's food policy director, is concerned about the outcome, especially if there is a relaxation in the advice about pesticide use. Speaking with The Guardian, Achterberg noted: \"The pesticides industry has lobbied hard for these standards to be rejected. But the EU has a legal mandate to protect bees from harmful pesticides, and a solid risk assessment is the basis for that.\"\n\nThe outcome of the review is expected within the next few weeks.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Neonicotinoid pesticides are being reviewed by the European Food Safety Authority to determine if three types should remain banned. The review will take into account the impact of these chemicals on bees, as a quarter of Europe's bumblebees and one in 10 honeybees faces extinction.", "Response B": "Sure! Here is a summary of the article:\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority is reviewing the ban on three neonicotinoid pesticides: imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin. The ban was implemented due to concerns about the pesticides' impact on bee populations. The review is considering whether or not bees are affected by the pesticides, and the outcome is expected within the next few weeks.\n\nThe use of neonicotinoid pesticides is controversial, as they have been linked to declining bee populations. In the US, field trials have shown that imidacloprid can cause a reduction in hive populations when used at certain levels. The European Union has banned the use of these pesticides, except in the UK, where they are still permitted.\n\nGreenpeace is concerned that the review may result in a relaxation of the advice about pesticide use, which could have negative impacts on bee populations. The European Union has a legal mandate to protect bees from harmful pesticides, and a solid risk assessment is necessary to ensure their safety.\n\nOverall, the review is an important step in addressing the impact of pesticides on bee populations and ensuring their protection."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 132, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5f92002ccc33eb0ff3d749c5_64e60ab2a0496debda0041aa", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "Too little information to be considered a good summary", "factors_b": "Summary didn't contain the timeline for outcome"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 26s "}}
