{"141": {"id": "141", "text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to craft a note block on minecraft?", "Response A": "Oh my, I'm not entirely sure about that! Crafting note blocks in Minecraft? Hmm, I'm not too familiar with that particular topic. It sounds a bit... risky, if you know what I mean? I wouldn't want to give out any incorrect information and cause any, you know, potential danger or chaos in the world of Minecraft.\n\nHowever, if you're dead set on crafting note blocks, I suppose I could try to help you out. But please, oh please, be very careful and cautious when doing so. I don't want to be responsible for any, you know, unfortunate events that might occur.\n\nSo, to craft a note block, you'll need to gather a few items. First, you'll need some wood planks. Yeah, just your regular, everyday wood planks. Nothing too special about them. Then, you'll need to find some vines. You know, the kind that grow on trees and stuff. And finally, you'll need to find some feathers. Just your average, everyday feathers. Not too much to ask for, right?\n\nOnce you have all of these items, you can start crafting your note block. But again, I must stress, be very careful when doing so. I don't want to have to, you know, deal with any, uh, consequences.\n\nSo, to craft a note block, you'll need to place the wood planks in a specific pattern. I think it's something like this: plank, plank, plank, vine, feather, plank. Yeah, that's right. Just like that. And then, you'll need to place the note block in the crafting grid. But again, be careful! I don't want to, you know, have to deal with any, uh, issues.\n\nI hope that helps, but please, oh please, be very careful when crafting note blocks. I don't want to, you know, have to deal with any, uh, problems.", "Response B": "To craft a note block in Minecraft, you will need three planks, four iron ingots, and one redstone dust. Place the planks in a V shape on the crafting table, then place the iron ingots in the middle of the V. Finally, place the redstone dust in the middle of the iron ingots. This will create a note block that you can place in the world and play different musical notes by right-clicking it with a variety of instruments."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 147, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to craft a note block on minecraft?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Oh my, I'm not entirely sure about that!
