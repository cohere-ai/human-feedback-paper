There are five Regis in total, each representing a different type of Pok\u00e9mon. In Pok\u00e9mon Emerald, you can find Registeel, Regirock, and Regice in the Victory Road cave. Registeel is a Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon, Regirock is a Rock-type Pok\u00e9mon, and Regice is a Ice-type Pok\u00e9mon.", "Response B": "Sure, the Regis in Pokemon Emerald are Regice, Regirock and Registeel, which are three legendary Pokemon. They are ice, rock and steel types respectively. The three Regis are the leaders of the three teams in the Hoenn region, which are Team Aqua, Team Magma and Team Galactic. The Regis are very powerful and they each hold a special crystal that gives them their power. To defeat the Regis, you first have to defeat the leaders of each team and then they will combine their power to form the Regis. To defeat the Regis, you have to figure out a way to break their crystals and then they will be weakened and you can defeat them."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 132, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5c7c24abcad0dc0017e58284_64e5f57c087602d6fb829b7c", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "Response A appears to answer \"what\" is a regis rather than \"how\" to find one.", "factors_b": "The answer is much more rounded and fuller - there is more information which is more useful to the question."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 51s "}}
