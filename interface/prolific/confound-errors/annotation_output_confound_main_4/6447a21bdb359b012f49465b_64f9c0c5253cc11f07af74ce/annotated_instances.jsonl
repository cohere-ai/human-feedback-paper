They believed they held the raw materials to allow scientists to breed the super plants of the future, crops that could survive anything nature could throw at them.\n\nThe Institute's founder, Nikolai Vavilov, had spent years collecting rare and wild relatives of wheat, rye and other staples so crop breeders could mine their hardy genes. Now the Nazis had laid siege to Leningrad (now St Petersburg), preventing the institute's workers from leaving the city. So the botanists barricaded themselves in with the stash, preparing to defend it from rats, freezing weather and desperately hungry citizens.\n\nLesser scientists would have eaten the precious packs of rice, wheat, peas, oats and potatoes during the 28-month siege. Instead, Dmitri S Ivanov, the head of the rice collection, a bespectacled man with fine, side-parted hair, painstakingly conserved several thousand packs of rice while gradually succumbing to malnutrition.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The shortlist for the Euston master development partner contract has been revealed by High Speed Two (HS2) Ltd. The winner will advise on sustainable, mixed-use opportunities, including new homes, offices and retail space, and work with HS2 Ltd, Network Rail, the station design contract winner and local authorities to deliver a unified masterplan. The scheme has the potential to deliver up to 22 hectares of development space as well as new public and green spaces across the site. Network Rail Property's managing director, David Biggs, said: \"This brings us another step closer to realising an exciting and vibrant new district in the heart of London. The opportunities are vast. A regenerated Euston station not only affords us the ability to improve connectivity and exceed the expectations of those travelling by train. It also allows us the rare chance to create new space for homes and businesses, to craft a desirable destination for people to live, work and meet. The new station can be a catalyst for local regeneration and increase connection across the local community, bringing huge benefits both to the area itself as well as the country as a whole.\"", "Response B": "A group of Russian scientists were trapped by Hitler's soldiers during the winter of 1941-42.
