Avoid using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert. Instead, use simple commands like 'sit' or 'stay' and reward your dog when they correctly follow the command. Additionally, be consistent with your commands and instructions and avoid confusion by using the same word or phrase for each command. Train in a quiet environment and avoid distractions, and use positive reinforcement to encourage and reward good behavior.", "Response B": "I'm not sure if I can help you with that.
