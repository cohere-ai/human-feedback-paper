I'd be delighted to guide you through the process of creating the most scrumptious baked apples with a heavenly vanilla sauce. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf70\n\nFirst, let's start with the apples. You'll need to preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). While your oven is warming up, core some delicious apples (I prefer Granny Smith or Golden Delicious) and fill the centers with a mixture of brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of salt. \ud83c\udf4f\ud83e\udddd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nNow, place the apple cores on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the apples are tender and caramelized. \ud83c\udf5e\ud83d\udc4c\n\nWhile the apples are baking, let's move on to the vanilla sauce. In a medium-sized saucepan, combine 2 tablespoons of butter, 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. \ud83e\udd44\ud83c\udf5c\n\nOver medium heat, stir the mixture until the butter and sugar have melted, and the sauce is smooth and creamy. \ud83c\udf6b\ud83d\udc4c\n\nOnce the apples are done baking, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. Serve the baked apples warm, topped with the divine vanilla sauce. \ud83c\udf4f\ud83e\udd5d\n\nAnd there you have it, my dear! A delectable dessert that's perfect for the fall season. The combination of sweet, tender apples and the creamy vanilla sauce will have your taste buds doing the cha cha slide with joy! \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc83\n\nSo go ahead, give this recipe a try, and let me know what you think!
