Let\u2019s start by reviewing some basic cooking techniques.  It\u2019s important to preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, and to grease a baking dish with a little butter or oil.  Next, wash and core the apples, and place them in the prepared baking dish.  Now we\u2019ll make the vanilla sauce: in a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of sugar, 2 tablespoons of melted butter, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1/2 cup of milk.  Mix well, and pour over the apples.  Bake for 30-40 minutes, until the apples are tender.  For the topping, combine 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and 2 tablespoons of melted butter.  Spread this mixture over the apples, and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes.  The apples are done when they are tender and the topping is lightly browned.  Serve the apples warm, with ice cream or vanilla sauce, and enjoy!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 53, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63b3377ca1ccdfc7cc567503_64f9b57f5edd41e1220dba3d", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "nothing else", "factors_b": "nothing else", "feedback": "good"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 21s "}}
