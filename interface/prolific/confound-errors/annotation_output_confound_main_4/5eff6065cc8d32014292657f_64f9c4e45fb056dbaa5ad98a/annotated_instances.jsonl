{"id": "372", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to clean a computer monitor?", "Response A": "To clean a computer monitor, start by turning it off and unplugging it. Then, use a microfiber cloth or a specialized monitor cleaning solution to gently wipe the screen. Avoid using rough or abrasive materials that could scratch the surface. If there are stubborn smudges or stains, use a mixture of water and vinegar or a glass cleaner to clean them. Be careful not to apply too much pressure or apply the solution directly to the screen. Finally, dry the screen thoroughly with a dry cloth or microfiber cloth to avoid streaks or smudges.", "Response B": ""}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_50", "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5eff6065cc8d32014292657f_64f9c4e45fb056dbaa5ad98a", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "Yes", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "Yes", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "1"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 28s "}}
