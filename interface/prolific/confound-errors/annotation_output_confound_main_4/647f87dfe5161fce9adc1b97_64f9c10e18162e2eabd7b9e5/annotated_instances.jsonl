Too often people forget the risks landlords take when renting out a property.\n\n\"The income they can generate is not guaranteed to stay the same each year, let alone rise. Where landlords are able to secure rent increases, they will often reinvest this money in the property making improvements. In the future, they may need to use the income generated by any rent increases to offset the impact of government changes that will see higher-rate relief on mortgages dramatically reduced.\"\n\nThe study shows London boroughs top the league table for most expensive private rents in England, with the majority of cheaper private rental properties located in the north, where average house prices are also significantly lower.\n\nOf the top 20 most expensive areas to rent private housing, only two are outside London.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Rent prices are increasing in Greater Manchester and the UK as a whole.
