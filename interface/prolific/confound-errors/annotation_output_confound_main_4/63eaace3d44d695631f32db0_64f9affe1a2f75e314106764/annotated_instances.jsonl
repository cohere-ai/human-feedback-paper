The paper details the principles of the ALP's approach, which includes the belief that primary property is yours to share and should be free of heavy-handed regulation, that the sharing economy should not compromise wages and conditions, that everyone engaged in business across the sharing economy must pay a fair share of tax at the standard rate, that sharing economy services must have property insurance and be covered by consumer law, and that they must be accessible to Australians with disabilities. The ALP also believes that tailored, light-touch rules should be put in place for the sharing economy, with zero tolerance for those who continue to flout Australian laws.", "Response B": "The sharing economy is a relatively new phenomenon, and Australian policymakers have been slow to respond to it. The Labor Party is the only party that has engaged in a serious policymaking process focused on the sharing economy, and has released policy documents on potential federal reforms and regulations. The documents state that primary property is yours to share and should be free of heavy-handed regulation, that a person who uses their own car, home or goods to deliver services is hardly as high-risk as running a big business, that sharing economy services must have property insurance and be covered by consumer law, and be accessible to Australians with disabilities, and that when governments put in place \"tailored, light touch rules for the sharing economy\", there should be zero tolerance for those who continue to flout Australian laws.
