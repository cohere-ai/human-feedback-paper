{"id": "109", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to maintain good credit?", "Response A": "Maintaining good credit is important for several reasons, including qualifying for loans and credit cards, renting an apartment, and even getting a job. Here are some tips for maintaining good credit:\n\n- Make on-time payments: Late payments can have a negative impact on your credit score, so it's important to make sure you pay your bills on time.\n- Keep your credit utilization low: Credit utilization is the amount of credit you're using compared to your total credit limit. A low credit utilization can help improve your credit score.\n- Keep your credit accounts open: Having a long credit history can help improve your credit score, so it's a good idea to keep your credit accounts open as long as possible.\n- Only apply for credit when you need it: Applying for too much credit can have a negative impact on your credit score, so it's a good idea to only apply for credit when you need it.", "Response B": "Maintaining good credit involves a few key steps. First, make sure you pay all of your bills on time to avoid late payments and missed payments. Second, keep your credit utilization low by only using a small amount of your available credit at any given time. Third, avoid opening too many new credit accounts at once, as this can negatively impact your credit score. It's also important to monitor your credit report regularly to ensure that there are no errors or fraudulent activity. Finally, be patient and consistent in your efforts to maintain good credit, as it takes time to build and improve your credit score."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 51, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5ffb432901d8311622530a52_64f9d0f45c77b2ba792eb5a9", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No", "feedback": "None"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 37s "}}
