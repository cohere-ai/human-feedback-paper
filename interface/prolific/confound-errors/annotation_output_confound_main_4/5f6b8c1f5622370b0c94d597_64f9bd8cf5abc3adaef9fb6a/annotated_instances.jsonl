{"id": "540", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to deal with verbal teasing?", "Response A": "Use a calm and even tone of voice. Avoid getting angry or defensive. Ignore the teasing and change the subject. If the teasing persists, consider setting boundaries or talking to a trusted friend or therapist for support.", "Response B": "Dealing with verbal teasing can be a challenging and complex issue, as it often involves a range of emotions and interpersonal dynamics. It's important to remember that everyone experiences teasing differently, and what may be considered harmless banter for one person may be deeply hurtful to another. \n\nIf you are experiencing verbal teasing, it may be helpful to consider the following strategies:\n\n- Try to understand the other person's perspective: It's possible that the person teasing you may not realize that their words are causing you harm. Try to explain to them how their teasing makes you feel and why it is inappropriate.\n- Set boundaries: It's important to establish clear boundaries and communicate them to the other person. Let them know what types of comments are acceptable and what types are not.\n- Seek support: It's okay to seek support from friends, family, or a mental health professional if you are feeling overwhelmed or upset by the teasing.\n- Practice self-care: Taking care of yourself is important in any situation, but especially when you are dealing with emotional stress. Make sure to get enough sleep, eat well, and engage in activities that make you feel good about yourself.\n- Seek professional help: If the teasing is severe or persistent, or if it is causing you significant distress, it may be helpful to seek professional help. A mental health professional can provide support and guidance in dealing with the situation."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 71, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5f6b8c1f5622370b0c94d597_64f9bd8cf5abc3adaef9fb6a", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "less in depth than B", "factors_b": "more in depth than A"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 20s "}}
