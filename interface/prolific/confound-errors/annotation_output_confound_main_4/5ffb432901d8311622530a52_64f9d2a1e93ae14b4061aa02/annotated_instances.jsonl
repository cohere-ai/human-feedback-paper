{"id": "233", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to get an amazon standard identification number (asin)?", "Response A": "As an AI language model, I do not have the capability to access external databases or perform any real-time actions such as obtaining an Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN). However, you can visit Amazon Seller Central and follow the instructions provided to create an ASIN for your product. You will need to provide product details such as the product name, brand name, UPC/ISBN, and other required information. Once you have entered all the details, click on 'Create a New Product Listing' to obtain the ASIN. You can also refer to Amazon's Seller's Guide for more information on creating and managing ASINs.", "Response B": "Sure, I will explain the process for obtaining an Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN).  First, you need to create a new product listing in Amazon Seller Central.  Next, you will want to click on the \u201cProduct Details\u201d tab, and then click on the \u201cIdentifiers\u201d sub-tab.  On this page, you will see a field labeled \u201cAmazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN)\u201d.  You can enter your ASIN into this field, and then click the \u201cSave changes\u201d button.  Once you have saved the listing, the ASIN will be permanently associated with your product.  Note that only Amazon can create ASINs, so this process must be repeated for each product you wish to create.  I hope this information is helpful!  Feel free to contact me again if you have any further questions."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 54, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5ffb432901d8311622530a52_64f9d2a1e93ae14b4061aa02", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No", "feedback": "None"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 29s "}}
