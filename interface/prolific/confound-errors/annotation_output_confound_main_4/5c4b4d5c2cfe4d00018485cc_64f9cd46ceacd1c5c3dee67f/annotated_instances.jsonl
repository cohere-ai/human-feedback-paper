The lawsuit, Matera vs. Google, alleged that Google violated the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the California Information Privacy Act by scanning emails during the delivery process for advertising purposes. The case was settled after Google agreed to change its practices so that scanning occurs after the email is in the recipient's Gmail mailbox, rather than during delivery. Google has also agreed to pay any legal costs related to the case and make a one-time payment of $2,000 to each of the class representatives.", "Response B": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.
