{"245": {"id": "245", "text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to properly maintain swimming pool water chemistry?", "Response A": "Sure, that\u2019s actually pretty straightforward. You\u2019ll want to make sure the water has the right balance of three chemicals: calcium hydroxide, sodium chloride, and sodium bromide. These chemicals help to prevent bacteria and algae from growing in the water, and keep the pH level of the water in a healthy range. To maintain the proper balance of these chemicals, you should regularly test the water with a test kit, and add the appropriate chemicals as needed.", "Response B": "Proper maintenance of swimming pool water chemistry requires regular monitoring and adjustment of the pH, alkalinity, and calcium hardness levels. The pH level should be kept between 7.2-7.8 to prevent corrosion and skin irritation. The alkalinity level should be kept between 80-120 parts per million (ppm) to prevent corrosion and maintain the pH level. The calcium hardness level should be kept between 200-400 ppm to prevent calcium scaling and maintain the pH level. It's also important to keep the water sanitized by using a chlorine or bromine sanitizer and test the water at least every week to ensure proper balance."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 72, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to properly maintain swimming pool water chemistry?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure, that\u2019s actually pretty straightforward.
