The asin is used to search for products on the Amazon website and to track orders.\n\nThere are a few different ways to get an asin. You can either search for products on the Amazon website and click on the \"Add to Cart\" button, or you can use the Amazon API to get the asin of a product. You can also use the Amazon SDK to get the asin of a product.\n\nThe asin is a unique identifier used to identify products on the Amazon website.

Let me know if you have any other questions.", "Response B": "Sure, I will explain the process for obtaining an Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN).  First, you need to create a new product listing in Amazon Seller Central.  Next, you will want to click on the \u201cProduct Details\u201d tab, and then click on the \u201cIdentifiers\u201d sub-tab.  On this page, you will see a field labeled \u201cAmazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN)\u201d.  You can enter your ASIN into this field, and then click the \u201cSave changes\u201d button.  Once you have saved the listing, the ASIN will be permanently associated with your product.  Note that only Amazon can create ASINs, so this process must be repeated for each product you wish to create.  I hope this information is helpful!  Feel free to contact me again if you have any further questions."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 54, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5f7a4d05a8da636ab1802596_64f9b3df9ab9e4917a871abf", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "Yes", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "Yes", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "2", "factors_a": "The prompt seems to have been parsed as \"How can I obtain the asin for an existing product on Amazon\", which is a reasonable interpretation although not necessarily the correct one (which simply asked how an asin can be obtained, without any reference to a product).
