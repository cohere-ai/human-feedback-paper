{"id": "639", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Under Armour has officially unveiled the successor to its SpeedForm Gemini 2 RE smart running shoe with three new styles to choose from and more data now on offer for runners.\n\nThe UA SpeedForm Gemini 3 RE ($160), Velociti RE ($140) and Europa RE ($160) range pack in the same sensors as the Gemini 2 shoe to offer automatic run tracking and the ability to record data including cadence, real-time pace as well as storing the mileage lifetime of the shoe.\n\nEssential reading: How connected footwear will invade your life\n\nAll of that data is stored in the iOS and Android-friendly MapMyRun app, which is integrated with Under Armour's Record app that pulls in data from other UA wearables including the UA Band and UA Heart Rate chest strap.\n\nUA SpeedForm Gemini 3 RE\n\nAlong with some basic running stats, Under Armour is also adding a new Jump Test feature that scientifically measures muscular fatigue level to help you decide whether you should be putting in a big 10 miler. It works by measuring the average air time of a sequence of jumps. It should help users track recovery status over time and provide guidance on how to alter the intensity of a workout.\n\nUA SpeedForm Europa RE\n\nThe new collection aims to cater for a wider range of runners, whether you're all about endurance or you prefer to pick up the pace. The Gemini 3 features a knit midfoot panel for added support and charged cushioning for improved responsiveness. The Europa is a more lightweight option with a mesh tongue and toe box for a more snug fit and increased ventilation. The Velocity is another lightweight shoe that includes an embedded sock liner for increased support and charged cushioning for an extra layer of durability. Like the Gemini 2, you don't need to charge any of these connected shoes.\n\nThe new UA SpeedForm range is going to be available to pre-order from the UA.com website from 5 January, which will include an annual subscription to MapMyRun. They're all going to be on show at CES 2017, which kicks off in January and we'll be there to take a closer look at them.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Under Armour has released the successor to its SpeedForm Gemini 2 RE smart running shoe, with the new UA SpeedForm Gemini 3 RE, Velociti RE and Europa RE models featuring sensors that offer automatic run tracking and record data including cadence, real-time pace and lifetime shoe mileage.

The ads, which will appear in print, radio, TV and online, are designed to counter claims that Uber's growth is threatening the livelihoods of yellow taxi drivers. The ads also feature testimonials from Uber drivers, many of whom are minorities. Uber is also running a \"de Blasio\" tab on its app, which shows riders the wait time for a ride if the cap is put in place."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_69", "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63cfee94707bca4ddee3eb05_64f9b95213ec0655793238e8", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "Yes", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "1", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "no"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 58s "}}
