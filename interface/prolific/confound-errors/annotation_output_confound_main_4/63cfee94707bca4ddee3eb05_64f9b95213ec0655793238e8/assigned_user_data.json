It works by measuring the average air time of a sequence of jumps. It should help users track recovery status over time and provide guidance on how to alter the intensity of a workout.\n\nUA SpeedForm Europa RE\n\nThe new collection aims to cater for a wider range of runners, whether you're all about endurance or you prefer to pick up the pace. The Gemini 3 features a knit midfoot panel for added support and charged cushioning for improved responsiveness. The Europa is a more lightweight option with a mesh tongue and toe box for a more snug fit and increased ventilation. The Velocity is another lightweight shoe that includes an embedded sock liner for increased support and charged cushioning for an extra layer of durability. Like the Gemini 2, you don't need to charge any of these connected shoes.\n\nThe new UA SpeedForm range is going to be available to pre-order from the UA.com website from 5 January, which will include an annual subscription to MapMyRun.
