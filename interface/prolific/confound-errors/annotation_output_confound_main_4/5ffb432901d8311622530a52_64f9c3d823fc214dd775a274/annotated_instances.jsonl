{"id": "397", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make white mayonnaise?", "Response A": "I think so. But I would need a little more information about the ingredients you have on hand and the equipment you have available.\n\nFor example, do you have a blender or food processor? If so, you can use it to make the mayonnaise. If not, you can make it by hand, but it will take a little more time and effort.\n\nAlso, what kind of oil do you have? You will need an oil that is liquid at room temperature, such as olive oil, canola oil, or sunflower oil.\n\nOnce you have the ingredients and equipment ready, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. In a blender or food processor, combine 1 egg yolk, 1/4 cup oil, 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, and a pinch of salt.\n2. Blend or process until the mixture is thick and creamy.\n3. Add more oil, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the mixture is the desired consistency.\n4. Blend or process until the mixture is smooth and well-combined.\n5. Transfer the mayonnaise to a bowl and stir in 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice and a pinch of salt.\n6. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.\n\nI hope this helps.
