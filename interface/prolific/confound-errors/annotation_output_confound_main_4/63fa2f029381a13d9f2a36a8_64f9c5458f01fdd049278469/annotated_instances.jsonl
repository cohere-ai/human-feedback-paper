This is important to prevent the mayonnaise from splitting.\r\nIf the mayonnaise does start to split, you can add a teaspoon of cold water and whisk vigorously until it comes back together.\r\nYou can adjust the flavor of the mayonnaise to your liking by adding more or less acid, salt, or pepper.\r\nOnce you have made your mayonnaise, you can store it in the refrigerator for up to a week. Mayonnaise is a versatile condiment that can be used in a variety of dishes, such as sandwiches, salads, and dips."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 6m 58s "}}
