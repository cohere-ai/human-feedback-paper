{"id": "80", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to clean a computer monitor?", "Response A": "To clean a computer monitor, first turn off the computer and unplug the monitor. Use a microfiber cloth to gently wipe the screen with a solution of equal parts water and vinegar, or a mixture of water and isopropyl alcohol. Avoid using paper towels or other rough materials that could scratch the screen. If there are stubborn stains, use a cotton swab dipped in the solution to gently scrub them. Finally, use a dry microfiber cloth to wipe away any remaining moisture and let the monitor air dry before turning it back on.", "Response B": "Hmm this is a very broad and complex question, and I would need to know much more about your specific situation and equipment in order to give helpful advice.  In general however, monitor screens can become dirty or smudged over time due to contact with fingerprints and other contaminants.  There are various cleaning products specifically designed for this purpose which can be purchased from office supply stores, and I would recommend using one of these products in conjunction with a soft cloth or cotton swab for best results.  Be sure to follow the instructions on the cleaning product carefully, as some of these products can be quite harmful if used incorrectly.  Another important consideration is the proper adjustment and calibration of the monitor itself, as this will greatly affect the visual appearance of the screen.  If you are having trouble with the appearance of your monitor screen, I would recommend seeking the advice of an expert in the field, or alternatively you could try adjusting the settings using the manual controls on your monitor.  \nHope this helps!  Good luck!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 50, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d038adefda4bb00013f8afb_64f9b0d0490a0522b7bd5913", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "Yes", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "You should never use vinegar on a computer monitor", "factors_b": "Well thought out answer asking for more details from the questioneer ", "feedback": "None"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 52s "}}
