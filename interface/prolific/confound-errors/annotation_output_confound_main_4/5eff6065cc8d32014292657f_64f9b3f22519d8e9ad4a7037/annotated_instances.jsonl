CSI bingo is a game played by law enforcement officers to help them remember the different types of crimes and evidence that they may encounter. The game is played by using a bingo card, which has a list of different crimes and evidence on it. The player marks off the crimes and evidence as they are called out, and the first player to get a line across the center of the card wins.\n\nThere are many different ways to play CSI bingo, but one of the most popular is to use a list of crimes and evidence that is specific to the player's area of law enforcement.
