How else can I help you?", "Response B": "Sure, here are some tips.  First, you\u2019ll want to cover the walls and ceiling with a base coat of white or off-white paint.  Next, you can add some accents in other colors.  For example, you could paint a border of flowers along the ceiling, or add a few polka dots or stripes on the walls.  You might also want to add some decorative details like a picture frame or a shelf.  Finally, you'll want to give the room a fresh coat of paint every few years to keep it looking good."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 58, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5eff6065cc8d32014292657f_64f9cb148bcf7980b8c018cc", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "Yes", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 1s "}}
