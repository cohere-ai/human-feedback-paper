{"id": "308", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to get free phone calls with smartphone apps?", "Response A": "In order to make free phone calls with smartphone apps, you need to have a smartphone, which is a mobile phone that can access the internet and run apps, as well as a smartphone app, which is a program you can download onto your phone.  Some popular apps for making free phone calls include Skype, Viber, and Facebook Messenger.  You can use these apps to make free calls to other users of the same app, as well as to regular phone numbers.  Some other apps, like Google Hangouts, let you make free calls to regular phone numbers, but charge for calls to other Google Hangouts users.  Most of these apps also offer text messaging for free.", "Response B": "There are a few ways to get free phone calls with smartphone apps. One way is to use a free calling app, such as WhatsApp or Skype, to make calls to other people who also have the app. Another way is to use a free calling app to make calls to people who have a traditional phone number and are using a free calling app. You can also use a free calling app to make calls to people who have a traditional phone number and are using a traditional phone service."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 73, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6427900008199d029ec7a7d0_64f9c7917d749b6c2257044a", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "Yes", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "The response was correct but incomplete.
