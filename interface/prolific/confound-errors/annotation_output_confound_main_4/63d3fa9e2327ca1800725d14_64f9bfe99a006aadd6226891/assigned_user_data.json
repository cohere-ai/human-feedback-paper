To make pudding dessert, you will need to cook a box of instant pudding according to the package instructions and fold in whipped cream. You can then layer the pudding and cake roll in a trifle dish for a delicious dessert.", "Response B": "Sure! To make this dessert, you\u2019ll need to prepare a vanilla cake roll and some vanilla pudding.  Then you\u2019ll spread the pudding over the cake roll, and roll it up into a log.  This dessert is best served chilled, so you can refrigerate it for at least an hour before serving.
