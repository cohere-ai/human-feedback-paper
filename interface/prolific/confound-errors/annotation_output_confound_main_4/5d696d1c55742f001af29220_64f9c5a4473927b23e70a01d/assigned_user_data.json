An Amazon Standard Identification Number (asin) is a unique number assigned to each product sold on Amazon.com. You can use an asin to look up product details, such as the product's name, description, reviews, and more.", "Response B": "Sure, I will explain the process for obtaining an Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN).  First, you need to create a new product listing in Amazon Seller Central.  Next, you will want to click on the \u201cProduct Details\u201d tab, and then click on the \u201cIdentifiers\u201d sub-tab.  On this page, you will see a field labeled \u201cAmazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN)\u201d.  You can enter your ASIN into this field, and then click the \u201cSave changes\u201d button.  Once you have saved the listing, the ASIN will be permanently associated with your product.  Note that only Amazon can create ASINs, so this process must be repeated for each product you wish to create.  I hope this information is helpful!  Feel free to contact me again if you have any further questions."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 54, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to get an amazon standard identification number (asin)?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure!
