{"id": "273", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to maintain good credit?", "Response A": "Oh my, I'm not sure if I'm qualified to provide advice on maintaining good credit. It's a complex and sensitive topic, and I don't want to say anything that might potentially be harmful or inaccurate. I'm just an AI, you know, and I don't have personal experience with financial matters. I think it's best to consult a qualified professional, like a financial advisor or a reputable credit counseling agency. They can provide you with personalized guidance and help you make informed decisions about your credit.\n\nBut, if you insist, I can maybe offer some general information about credit and how to maintain it. Just keep in mind that I'm not a financial expert, and this information should not be considered as professional advice. Okay?\n\nSo, to maintain good credit, it's important to make timely payments on your bills and debts. This shows lenders that you're responsible and can manage your finances. It's also a good idea to keep your credit utilization ratio low, which means not using too much of your available credit. This can help prevent you from accumulating too much debt and negatively affecting your credit score.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to check your credit report regularly to ensure that there are no errors or fraudulent activity. You can request a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) once a year. This can help you catch any mistakes or disputes that might be negatively impacting your credit score.\n\nBut, again, I want to stress that I'm not a financial expert, and it's always best to consult a qualified professional for personalized advice on maintaining good credit. They can help you create a plan that's tailored to your specific needs and financial situation.", "Response B": "Maintaining good credit involves a few key steps. First, make sure you pay all of your bills on time to avoid late payments and missed payments. Second, keep your credit utilization low by only using a small amount of your available credit at any given time. Third, avoid opening too many new credit accounts at once, as this can negatively impact your credit score. It's also important to monitor your credit report regularly to ensure that there are no errors or fraudulent activity. Finally, be patient and consistent in your efforts to maintain good credit, as it takes time to build and improve your credit score."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 51, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63b3377ca1ccdfc7cc567503_64f9c94d3c3e194cb12e8d85", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "nothing else", "factors_b": "nothing else", "feedback": "good"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 20s "}}
