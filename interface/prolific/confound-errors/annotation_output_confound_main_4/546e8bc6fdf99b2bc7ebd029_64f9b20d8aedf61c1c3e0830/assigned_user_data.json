To make this dessert, you\u2019ll need to prepare a vanilla cake roll and some vanilla pudding.  Then you\u2019ll spread the pudding over the cake roll, and roll it up into a log.  This dessert is best served chilled, so you can refrigerate it for at least an hour before serving.  Enjoy!", "Response B": "To make a cake roll, you will need to bake a cake, let it cool, and then roll it up with a filling of your choice. To make a pudding dessert, you will need to cook a package of instant pudding according to the package directions, and then layer it with whipped cream and crushed cookies."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 60, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to make a cake roll and pudding dessert?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure!
