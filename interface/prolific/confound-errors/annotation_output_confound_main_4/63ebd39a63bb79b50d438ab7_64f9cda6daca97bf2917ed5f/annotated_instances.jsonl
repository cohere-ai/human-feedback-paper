{"id": "184", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to hatch a girl chikorita in pok\u00e9mon diamond, pearl, and platinum?", "Response A": "You can hatch a girl chikorita in pok\u00e9mon diamond, pearl, and platinum by walking around the map and finding a tree with a golden egg on it.", "Response B": "To hatch a female Chikorita in Pok\u00e9mon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. First, you will need to obtain a male and female Chikorita. You can do this by breeding two Chikorita, or by trading with another player.\n\n2. Once you have a male and female Chikorita, you will need to breed them. To do this, you will need to put the male and female Chikorita in the same Pok\u00e9 Ball and then put the Pok\u00e9 Ball in a Pok\u00e9mon Day Care. The Pok\u00e9mon Day Care will then take care of the Chikorita and allow them to breed.\n\n3. After the Chikorita have bred, you will need to take the Pok\u00e9 Ball out of the Pok\u00e9mon Day Care and then put the Pok\u00e9 Ball in a Pok\u00e9mon Nursery. The Pok\u00e9mon Nursery will then take care of the Chikorita and allow them to hatch.\n\n4. Once the Chikorita have hatched, you will need to take the Pok\u00e9 Ball out of the Pok\u00e9mon Nursery and then catch the Chikorita.\n\n5. Finally, you will need to check the gender of the Chikorita. You can do this by going to the Pok\u00e9mon's summary page and then looking at the Pok\u00e9mon's gender.\n\nNote: It is important to remember that the gender of a Chikorita is determined by the game's random number generator, so there is no guarantee that the Chikorita will be female. However, by following these steps, you will have a higher chance of hatching a female Chikorita."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 61, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63ebd39a63bb79b50d438ab7_64f9cda6daca97bf2917ed5f", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 42s "}}
