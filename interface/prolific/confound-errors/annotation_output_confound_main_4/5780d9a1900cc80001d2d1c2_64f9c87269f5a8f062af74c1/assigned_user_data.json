In general however, monitor screens can become dirty or smudged over time due to contact with fingerprints and other contaminants.  There are various cleaning products specifically designed for this purpose which can be purchased from office supply stores, and I would recommend using one of these products in conjunction with a soft cloth or cotton swab for best results.  Be sure to follow the instructions on the cleaning product carefully, as some of these products can be quite harmful if used incorrectly.  Another important consideration is the proper adjustment and calibration of the monitor itself, as this will greatly affect the visual appearance of the screen.
