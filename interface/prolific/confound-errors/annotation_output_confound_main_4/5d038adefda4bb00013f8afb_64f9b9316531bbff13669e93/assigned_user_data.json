But I would need a little more information about the ingredients you have on hand and the equipment you have available.\n\nFor example, do you have a blender or food processor? If so, you can use it to make the mayonnaise. If not, you can make it by hand, but it will take a little more time and effort.\n\nAlso, what kind of oil do you have? You will need an oil that is liquid at room temperature, such as olive oil, canola oil, or sunflower oil.\n\nOnce you have the ingredients and equipment ready, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. In a blender or food processor, combine 1 egg yolk, 1/4 cup oil, 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, and a pinch of salt.\n2. Blend or process until the mixture is thick and creamy.\n3. Add more oil, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the mixture is the desired consistency.\n4. Blend or process until the mixture is smooth and well-combined.\n5. Transfer the mayonnaise to a bowl and stir in 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice and a pinch of salt.\n6. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.", "Response B": "Sure, although you may not know this, mayonnaise is an emulsification of fat into water, with some additional ingredients to enhance flavor and texture.  In general, emulsification can be performed using various techniques, but the most common method for home cooks is to use an immersion blender, which is also known as a stick blender.  The process involves combining ingredients in a mixing bowl, and then using the blender to incorporate air into the mixture, which will enable the fat and water to remain evenly mixed.  Air can also be incorporated by hand, using a whisk, but this is more time consuming and less effective.  The ingredients typically used for mayonnaise are eggs, oil, vinegar, and various seasonings.  For a white mayonnaise, you would typically use a white vinegar, such as white wine vinegar or white vinegar made from distilled vinegar and water, and you would leave out any ingredients that would add color, such as mustard or paprika, which are often included in yellow mayonnaise."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 65, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to make white mayonnaise?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            I think so.
