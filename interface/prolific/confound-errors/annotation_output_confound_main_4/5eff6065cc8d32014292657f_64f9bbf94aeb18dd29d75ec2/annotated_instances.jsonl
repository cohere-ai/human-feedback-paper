{"id": "575", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to serve at a dinner party?", "Response A": "Of course, I'd be happy to help! Here are some simple steps to follow when serving at a dinner party:\n\n1. Sit down: Before you start serving, make sure you have a place to sit down. This will help you stay focused and not trip over anything.\n2. Get the plates: Find the plates and bring them to the table. Make sure they are clean and ready for the food.\n3. Fill the plates: Use a spoon or tongs to put the food on the plates. Make sure to fill each plate with a little bit of everything.\n4. Pass the plates: Once the plates are filled, pass them around the table to each guest. Make sure to pass the plates to the right, so everyone gets the food they need.\n5. Keep the glasses full: Keep the glasses full of water or other drinks. If someone needs a refill, fill their glass up again.\n6. Clean up: After everyone is done eating, clean up the table by taking away the plates and glasses. Make sure to throw away any trash.\n\nRemember, serving at a dinner party is all about being helpful and making sure everyone has what they need. Just follow these simple steps and you'll do great!", "Response B": "Certainly. Here are some suggestions:\n\n-Have a plan for the evening, so you\u2019re not running around frantically at the last minute.  You\u2019ll want to make sure you have enough time to prepare and serve each course.  So if you\u2019re planning to serve a four-course meal, you might want to have a main course that takes about 30 minutes to prepare, and a dessert that takes about 15 minutes.  Then you might want to have a first course that takes 5-10 minutes to prepare, and a second course that takes about 20 minutes.\n-Figure out how many people you\u2019re serving, and whether you\u2019re serving family style or individually.  If you\u2019re serving family style, you\u2019ll want to make sure you have enough plates, bowls, and silverware for everyone.  And if you\u2019re serving individually, you\u2019ll want to make sure you have enough of each dish to go around.\n-Make sure you have all the ingredients for each course prepared ahead of time.  If you\u2019re making a salad, make sure you have the lettuce washed and chopped, the dressing made, and so on.  If you\u2019re making a main course, make sure you have all the ingredients prepped and ready to go.  If you\u2019re making a dessert, make sure you have the dessert prepared and ready to go.  This will make the evening go much more smoothly.\n-Before you start serving, make sure the table is set appropriately.  If you\u2019re not using placemats, you\u2019ll want to make sure the table is properly set"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 62, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5eff6065cc8d32014292657f_64f9bbf94aeb18dd29d75ec2", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 45s "}}
