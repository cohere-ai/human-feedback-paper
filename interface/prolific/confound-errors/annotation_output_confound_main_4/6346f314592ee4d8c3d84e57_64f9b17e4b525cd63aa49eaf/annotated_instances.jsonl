{"id": "790", "input_text": {"Prompt": "The emergence of internet and smartphone-based companies such as Airtasker, which allows users to book a landscaper or babysitter, and car service GoGet have caught governments around the world by surprise.\n\nAustralian policymakers have been particularly slow to respond compared with the US and Britain.\n\nSo far, Labor is the only party to engage in a serious policymaking process focused on thorny regulatory, labour and tax issues thrown up by the sharing economy.\n\nWork on Labor's approach began under shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh in March and was followed by a six-month consultation process with the sector that drew more than 500 submissions.\n\n\"New services like Airbnb, Airtasker, Camplify and GoGet are changing the way Australians buy and sell things,\" Mr Shorten says. \"They are also changing how we think about work and the line between private property and public goods.\n\n\"There is huge economic and community potential in this emerging peer-to-peer market.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLabor's first principle on potential federal reforms and regulations is that \"primary property is yours to share\" and should be free of heavy-handed regulation.\n\nMr Shorten believes that a person who uses their own car, home or goods to deliver services is hardly as high-risk as running a big business.\n\nSecond, the sharing economy shouldn't compromise wages and conditions.\n\nThird, everyone engaged in business across the sharing economy must pay a fair share of tax at the \"standard rate\", regardless of whether they are local firms or big international ones.\n\nFourth and fifth, sharing economy services must have property insurance and be covered by consumer law, and be accessible to Australians with disabilities.\n\nFinally, when governments put in place \"tailored, light touch rules for the sharing economy\", there should be zero tolerance for those who continue to flout Australian laws.\n\nLabor's policy documents concedes that striking a balance between supporting innovation and protecting the community is difficult.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Hi there! I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide information on a topic based on available data and sources. The sharing economy is a complex and evolving field, and it's understandable that policymakers and regulators might be cautious in their approach to regulating these new types of businesses and services.\n\nFrom what you've provided, it seems that Labor is the only political party in Australia that has taken a serious look at the regulatory, labor, and tax issues surrounding the sharing economy. Their approach includes a few key principles, such as respecting the property rights of individuals who use their own assets to deliver services, ensuring that wages and conditions are fair, and requiring that all businesses in the sharing economy pay their fair share of taxes.\n\nAdditionally, Labor's policy documents acknowledge that striking a balance between supporting innovation and protecting the community can be difficult. This is a common challenge for policymakers and regulators around the world who are grappling with the implications of the sharing economy.\n\nOverall, it seems that Labor is taking a thoughtful and balanced approach to regulating the sharing economy, with a focus on supporting innovation while also protecting consumers and ensuring fairness for all parties involved. However, it's important to note that this is a rapidly evolving field, and the best approach to regulation may change over time as the sharing economy continues to grow and mature.", "Response B": "The Australian Labor Party (ALP) has released a policy paper outlining its approach to the sharing economy, the first of its kind in Australia. The paper details the principles of the ALP's approach, which includes the belief that primary property is yours to share and should be free of heavy-handed regulation, that the sharing economy should not compromise wages and conditions, that everyone engaged in business across the sharing economy must pay a fair share of tax at the standard rate, that sharing economy services must have property insurance and be covered by consumer law, and that they must be accessible to Australians with disabilities. The ALP also believes that tailored, light-touch rules should be put in place for the sharing economy, with zero tolerance for those who continue to flout Australian laws."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 70, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6346f314592ee4d8c3d84e57_64f9b17e4b525cd63aa49eaf", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "Maybe a little bit long for a summary", "factors_b": "Formatting not great, all in one paragraph but there was no direct request to format it any way in the prompt"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 45s "}}
