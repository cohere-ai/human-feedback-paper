The Death Machine is the most effective weapon against George Romero, as it can deal a lot of damage in a short amount of time. If you can get your hands on one, use it all on George.\r\nUpgrade your weapons. Upgraded weapons will do more damage to George, making him easier to kill. The upgraded Druganov, Ray Gun, and L96A1 are all good choices.\r\nGo for headshots. George has a large head, making it a relatively easy target to hit. Aim for headshots to deal the most damage.\r\nUse Scavenger. Scavenger will allow you to pick up more ammo, which is essential for killing George.\r\nBe patient. George is a tough enemy, so don't expect to kill him quickly. Be patient and take your time, and eventually you will be victorious.\r\nHere are some additional tips from Redditors:\r\n\r\nUse the theater mode to learn his spawn points. Once you know where he spawns, you can be prepared for him and take him out quickly.\r\nUse the traps to your advantage. The traps on Call of the Dead can be very effective against George. Lure him into a trap and then activate it to deal a lot of damage to him.\r\nPlay with friends. Playing with friends makes it much easier to kill George. You can work together to distract him, revive each other, and share ammo."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 10m 20s "}}
