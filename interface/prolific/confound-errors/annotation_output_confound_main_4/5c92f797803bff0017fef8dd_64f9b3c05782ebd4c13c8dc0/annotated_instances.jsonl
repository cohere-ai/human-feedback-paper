{"id": "721", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Trapped by Hitler's soldiers during the brutal winter of 1941-42, a band of Russian botanists faced a terrible choice.\n\nFor more than a decade, workers at the Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry had been gathering seeds from all over the world and carefully preserving them in a locked vault. They believed they held the raw materials to allow scientists to breed the super plants of the future, crops that could survive anything nature could throw at them.\n\nThe Institute's founder, Nikolai Vavilov, had spent years collecting rare and wild relatives of wheat, rye and other staples so crop breeders could mine their hardy genes. Now the Nazis had laid siege to Leningrad (now St Petersburg), preventing the institute's workers from leaving the city. So the botanists barricaded themselves in with the stash, preparing to defend it from rats, freezing weather and desperately hungry citizens.\n\nLesser scientists would have eaten the precious packs of rice, wheat, peas, oats and potatoes during the 28-month siege. Instead, Dmitri S Ivanov, the head of the rice collection, a bespectacled man with fine, side-parted hair, painstakingly conserved several thousand packs of rice while gradually succumbing to malnutrition.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The botanists had to decide whether to eat or preserve a collection of seeds during a siege.", "Response B": "Okay! Here's the summary:\n\nThere was a special place in Russia where scientists kept many different types of seeds from all over the world. They believed these seeds could help create super crops that could survive anything. When bad people called Nazis came to the city where the place was located, the scientists barricaded themselves inside with the seeds to keep them safe. Instead of eating the seeds, the head of the rice collection, a kind man named Dmitri, carefully saved them even though he was very hungry."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 59, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5c92f797803bff0017fef8dd_64f9b3c05782ebd4c13c8dc0", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 28s "}}
