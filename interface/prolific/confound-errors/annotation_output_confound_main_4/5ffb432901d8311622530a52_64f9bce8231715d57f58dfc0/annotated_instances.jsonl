Labor's policy on the sharing economy acknowledges the potential benefits of the sharing economy, while also acknowledging the need to protect consumers and ensure that everyone pays their fair share of tax and complies with relevant laws.  Labor's policy proposes a number of principles to guide regulation of the sharing economy, including a \"primary property is yours to share\" principle, which states that people should be free to participate in the sharing economy without facing heavy-handed regulation, and a \"zero tolerance\" approach to those who continue to flout Australian laws.  Labor's policy also emphasizes the need to ensure that everyone engaged in the sharing economy pays a fair share of tax and complies with relevant laws and regulations.  Finally, Labor's policy supports the sharing economy provided that wages and conditions are protected, and that sharing economy services are accessible to Australians with disabilities.", "Response B": "The sharing economy is a relatively new phenomenon, and Australian policymakers have been slow to respond to it. The Labor Party is the only party that has engaged in a serious policymaking process focused on the sharing economy, and has released policy documents on potential federal reforms and regulations. The documents state that primary property is yours to share and should be free of heavy-handed regulation, that a person who uses their own car, home or goods to deliver services is hardly as high-risk as running a big business, that sharing economy services must have property insurance and be covered by consumer law, and be accessible to Australians with disabilities, and that when governments put in place \"tailored, light touch rules for the sharing economy\", there should be zero tolerance for those who continue to flout Australian laws.
