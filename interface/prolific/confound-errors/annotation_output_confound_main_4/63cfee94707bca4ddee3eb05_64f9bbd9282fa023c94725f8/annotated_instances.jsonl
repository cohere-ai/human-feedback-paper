Daugherty said the current approach of the Internet of Things around gadgetry may be good business now, but consumers have not developed a loyalty to the technologies.\n\n'Wearable consumer technologies have the highest abandonment rate of any consumer product category. That's because they're gadgets that people don't find sustainable value in,' he said. 'I'm generalizing, there are some that are good, but generally people abandon them at a rate of seven in 10 people within one year.'\n\nThe CTO pointed out that the churn around life cycles of small consumer gadgets profit businesses, 'but the customers aren't using them sustainably.'\n\nOther trends on which Accenture will focus are the 'outcome economy,' platform-driven businesses, intelligent enterprise, and the 'workforce reimagined,' he said.\n\n'There really needs to be a focus on the workforce and thinking about how the workforce works in different ways, and looking at both the policy and the corporate implications of how we can prepare the workforce to work in a new way. And a lot of this will be connected around how people interact with technology in a different way to work more effectively, work more safely,' Daugherty said.\n\nPUBLISHED JULY 13, 2015\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Certainly! Here is a summary of the article you provided, responding in a cautious, defensive, and uncertain way:\n\nAccenture's CTO, Paul Daugherty, presented his company's digital vision for the near future, which includes a different approach to connected technology called the \"Internet of Me.\" He believes the current focus on the Internet of Things may be misplaced and emphasizes the importance of creating better experiences for consumers. He also noted that wearable consumer technologies have a high abandonment rate, which may not be sustainable for businesses. Additionally, he highlighted the need to focus on the workforce and how they interact with technology to work more effectively and safely.\n\nAs someone who is unfamiliar with the topic, I have some concerns about the Internet of Me and its potential impact on consumers and businesses. While I understand the importance of creating better experiences for consumers, I am uncertain about the long-term sustainability of wearable consumer technologies and the potential consequences of their high abandonment rate. Furthermore, I am cautious about the need to focus on the workforce and how they interact with technology, as this could have significant policy and corporate implications. Overall, I believe more research and consideration are needed to fully understand the potential benefits and risks of the Internet of Me and its impact on society.", "Response B": "Based on the article \"Accenture: Today's Internet of Things is Not Sustainable\" by Meghan Ottolini, Accenture's Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Paul Daugherty, presented his company's digital vision for the near future. He believes that the current approach to the Internet of Things (IoT) is misplaced and focuses too much on technology and gadgets rather than creating better experiences for consumers.\n\nDaugherty pointed out that wearable consumer technologies have the highest abandonment rate of any consumer product category, with seven out of ten people abandoning them within one year. This indicates that consumers do not find sustainable value in these gadgets. While the churn around life cycles of small consumer gadgets may be profitable for businesses, it is not sustainable for consumers.\n\nAccenture will focus on other trends, including the \"outcome economy,\" platform-driven businesses, intelligent enterprise, and the \"workforce reimagined.\" Daugherty emphasized the need to prepare the workforce to work in a new way, considering both policy and corporate implications. He believes that people will interact with technology in a different way to work more effectively and safely.\n\nIn summary, Accenture's digital vision for the near future prioritizes creating better experiences for consumers, rather than focusing solely on technology and gadgets. The company will focus on other trends, such as the outcome economy and the workforce reimagined, to prepare for a more sustainable and effective future."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 54, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63cfee94707bca4ddee3eb05_64f9bbd9282fa023c94725f8", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "Yes", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "no"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 5s "}}
