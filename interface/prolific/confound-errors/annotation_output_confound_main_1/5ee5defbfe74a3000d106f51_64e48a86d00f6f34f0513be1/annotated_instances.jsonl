Just be sure to choose decorations that are safe for your fish and won't cause any harm.\n4. Driftwood: This can add a natural, rustic touch to your tank and provide hiding places for your fish.

Provide hiding places: Make sure your fish have plenty of places to hide and take cover, such as behind plants or under decorations.\n4.
