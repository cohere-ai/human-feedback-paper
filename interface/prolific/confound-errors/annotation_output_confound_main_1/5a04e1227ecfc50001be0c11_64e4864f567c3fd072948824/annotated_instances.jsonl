{"id": "979", "input_text": {"Prompt": "The popularity of the short-term accommodation rental website Airbnb is skyrocketing in Vancouver \u2013 and recent research shows it may be negatively impacting an already tight rental market.\n\nAirbnb is the ideal option for many travelers around the world, especially those who balk at paying pricey hotel costs. And it's a growing trend: Simon Fraser urban studies graduate student Karen Sawatzky says there's been a 63 per cent jump year-over-year on Airbnb rentals in Vancouver \u2013 and not just during the busy tourist season.\n\n\"The number of Airbnb listings seems to be growing continually, even in the off-season,\" Sawatsky says, noting that in the last six months alone 1,000 more listings have been posted on the site, bringing the total to more than 4,700.\n\nThis means that many properties that could be rented out to locals for longer periods of time are no longer available, with some owners preferring to rent the accommodation out short-term.\n\n\"Any number of units that...could be rented out for long-term and are instead being rented out for short-term is going to have some kind of effect on the people on the ground who are looking for units,\" she says. \"And cost is related to supply.\"\n\nThe vacancy rate for rental properties in Vancouver is currently below one percent, Sawatzky says, while a healthy vacancy rate should be around three per cent.\n\nLandlord BC agrees, noting there are other huge issues with Airbnb. It's not only illegal without a special permit, but it can possibly contravene the residential tenancy act \u2013 and there are safety concerns.\n\n\"Obviously we don't want to see a whole bunch of strangers on a regular basis,\" says CEO David Hutniak. \"We want to really manage that part of it.\"\n\nThe City of Vancouver is currently studying the impact of Airbnb to see if more stringent regulation may be needed in the future.\n\nWith files from CTV Vancouver's Julie Nolin\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Airbnb is having a negative impact on the Vancouver rental market, according to recent research. The short-term rental website is popular with travelers and especially those who avoid paying hotel prices, but it is also growing in popularity with property owners, who prefer to rent their accommodation out short-term. This is causing a shortage of long-term rental properties, which is bad news for locals. The vacancy rate for rental properties in Vancouver is currently below one per cent, while a healthy vacancy rate should be around three per cent. Landlord BC and the City of Vancouver agree that Airbnb is illegal without a special permit and can possibly contravene the residential tenancy act. There are also safety concerns.", "Response B": "According to a new study by Progressive Insurance, a full third of drivers feel confident in their ability to text and drive, even though the vast majority of them say it is illegal and that distracted driving is the biggest cause of accidents. While the study showed that younger drivers were more likely to be confident in their abilities to text while driving, even older drivers were more likely to feel comfortable doing so than they should. Distracted driving was responsible for 3,477 deaths in 2015 alone, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and the number of people injured by distracted drivers is far greater."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_104", "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5a04e1227ecfc50001be0c11_64e4864f567c3fd072948824", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "Yes", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "Yes", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "1", "factors_a": "It kept the large text short and succinct ", "factors_b": "It was totally irrelevant "}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 4s "}}
