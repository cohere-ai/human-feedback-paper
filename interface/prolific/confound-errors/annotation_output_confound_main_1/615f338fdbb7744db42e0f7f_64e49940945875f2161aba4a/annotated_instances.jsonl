Enjoy!", "Response B": "Sure, I can try to help you with that. I think you'll need some pumpkin puree, eggs, milk, flour, sugar, baking powder, and a few other ingredients. You'll also need a griddle or a frying pan, and some butter or oil to cook the pancakes in.\n\nTo make the pancakes, you'll first need to mix together the dry ingredients, then add the wet ingredients and mix until the batter is smooth. Then, you'll need to heat up the griddle or frying pan over medium heat, and add a little butter or oil to the pan. Once the butter or oil is hot, you can add the batter to the pan in 1/4 cup increments, and cook the pancakes for a few minutes on each side until they are golden brown and cooked through.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 109, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "615f338fdbb7744db42e0f7f_64e49940945875f2161aba4a", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "Yes", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "1", "factors_a": "Answer better because lays it out like a recipe with ingredients listed at top and numbered steps", "factors_b": "response more vauge and harde to follow"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 14s "}}
