Here is a summary of the article you provided, responding in a cautious, defensive, and uncertain way:\n\nStatoil has recently acquired a 25% stake in the Roncador oilfield in Brazil from Petrobras for up to $2.85 billion. This acquisition is expected to nearly triple Statoil's production in South America, with an estimated output of 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The remaining recoverable volumes of the field are projected to be over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent, with the potential for an increase in the recovery factor of at least 5 percentage points. However, the transaction is subject to approval from Brazilian authorities and the exact details of the deal, including the additional contingent payments, have not been confirmed. Overall, the acquisition represents a significant expansion of Statoil's presence in Brazil and could potentially lead to increased oil production in the country.
