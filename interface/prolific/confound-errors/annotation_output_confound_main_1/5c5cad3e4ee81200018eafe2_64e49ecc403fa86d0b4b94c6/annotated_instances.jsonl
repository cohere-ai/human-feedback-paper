{"id": "426", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Dive Brief:\n\nTwo coding schools, The Iron Yard and Code Fellows, have partnered with nonprofit financial literacy organization Operation HOPE to create a $100 million scholarship fund to spur minority and low-income student engagement in tech fields.\n\nThe partnership will give qualified students access to coding instruction, and will connect graduates with professional opportunities in government and private industry upon completion.\n\nParticipating federal agencies and corporate partners will also provide financial literacy training and transitional mentoring into careers.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThis program is a significant step in the direction of public-private partnership in the name of equaling the workforce development playing field. And it is the latest in several initiatives where the federal government is engaged with non-traditional learning institutions to solve the problem of college affordability and post-graduate career outcomes.\n\nAs many universities are being queried by the federal government on how they spend their endowment money, and enrollment decreases among all institutions nationally, traditional campuses will need to look at these partnerships as a sign of where education is likely going in the future, and what the federal government may be willing to finance with its student loan programs going ahead.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The Iron Yard and Code Fellows are partnering with a charity called Operation HOPE to give people access to coding instruction and job opportunities after completing the program.  The federal government is involved with this program to help people learn to code and get jobs after they graduate.  This partnership shows the government is willing to help fund education and training for people who may not be able to afford it otherwise.", "Response B": "New research by the US Geological Survey (USGS) has revealed that the glaciers of Bolivia have shrunk by 43% between 1986 and 2014. According to the researchers, if current trends continue, the glaciers could shrink by more than 90% by the year 2100. This news comes as hundreds of potentially dangerous glacial lakes have formed in the Himalayas during the past few decades. In Bolivia, a glacier outburst flood in 2009 washed away farm animals, crops and bridges. The receding glaciers also endanger the water supply, as the melted water from glaciers is an important source of drinking water and hydroelectric power for the capital La Paz and neighbouring El Alto."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_108", "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5c5cad3e4ee81200018eafe2_64e49ecc403fa86d0b4b94c6", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "1", "factors_a": "Is concise and covers the relevant information although it could have elaborated a bit more.", "factors_b": "Responds to totally the wrong topic that the prompt requires a summary of."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 47s "}}
