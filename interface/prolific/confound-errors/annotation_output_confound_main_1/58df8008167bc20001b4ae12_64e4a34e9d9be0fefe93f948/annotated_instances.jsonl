The research firm expects wearables shipments to more than double by 2021, reaching 240 million units.\n\nThe wearables market is still dominated by watches and wristbands, but more form factors have emerged in the category, including earwear and connected clothing. The addition of these devices has helped bolster the wearables segment overall, especially as compared to the consolidating smartphone segment.\n\nAs the wearables space matures, IDC expects to see significant advances in devices, including digital assistants, cellular connectivity, and connections to larger systems, both at home and at work.\n\n\"It's not just the end users who will benefit from these advanced devices,\" said Senior Research Analyst Jitesh Ubrani in a statement. \"Opportunities also exist for developers and channel partners to provide the apps, services, and distribution that will support the growing abundance of wearables. From a deployment perspective, the commercial segment also stands to benefit as wearables enable productivity, lower costs, and increase ROI in the long term.\"\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The October 2017 global catastrophe report by Aon Benfield says that the California wildfires could drive an insurance industry loss of up to $8 billion. This is the costliest insured wildfire event ever recorded. The report says that claims have already been filed resulting in payouts of more than $3.32 billion and this figure is expected to rise to $8 billion. Aon Benfield will revise its estimates once claims are finalised.", "Response B": "The IDC report predicts that the wearable technology market will continue to grow rapidly over the next few years, with shipments of wearable devices more than doubling by 2021.  The report highlights that the wearables market is becoming increasingly diverse, with a wide range of new form factors emerging beyond traditional watches and wristbands.  IDC expects that advanced new features will also be introduced in wearable devices over the coming years, including advanced digital assistants, cellular connectivity, and integrations with larger systems in both the home and workplace.  The report notes that the growing adoption of wearable technology will bring significant benefits for both end users and various other stakeholders in the value chain."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": "distractor_110", "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "58df8008167bc20001b4ae12_64e4a34e9d9be0fefe93f948", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 49s "}}
