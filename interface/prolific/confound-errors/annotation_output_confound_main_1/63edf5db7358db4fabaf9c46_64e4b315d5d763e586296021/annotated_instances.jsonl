He believes that the current approach to the Internet of Things (IoT) is misplaced and focuses too much on technology and gadgets rather than creating better experiences for consumers.\n\nDaugherty pointed out that wearable consumer technologies have the highest abandonment rate of any consumer product category, with seven out of ten people abandoning them within one year. This indicates that consumers do not find sustainable value in these gadgets. While the churn around life cycles of small consumer gadgets may be profitable for businesses, it is not sustainable for consumers.\n\nAccenture will focus on other trends, including the \"outcome economy,\" platform-driven businesses, intelligent enterprise, and the \"workforce reimagined.\" Daugherty emphasized the need to prepare the workforce to work in a new way, considering both policy and corporate implications. He believes that people will interact with technology in a different way to work more effectively and safely.\n\nIn summary, Accenture's digital vision for the near future prioritizes creating better experiences for consumers, rather than focusing solely on technology and gadgets. The company will focus on other trends, such as the outcome economy and the workforce reimagined, to prepare for a more sustainable and effective future."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_105", "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63edf5db7358db4fabaf9c46_64e4b315d5d763e586296021", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "Yes", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "Yes", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "Yes", "refusal_b": "Yes", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "1", "factors_a": " no ", "factors_b": "no"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 11m 7s "}}
