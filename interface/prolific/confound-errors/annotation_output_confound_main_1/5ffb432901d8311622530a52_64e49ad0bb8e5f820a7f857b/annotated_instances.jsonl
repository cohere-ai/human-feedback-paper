{"id": "528", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Credit card skimmers, which are devices that can gather information from credit or debit cards that are used to pay at gas station pumps, have been found at two different Manhattan gas stations in two separate calls on March 9 and March 10, according to a March 13 press release from Riley County Police Department.\n\nIn both cases the devices were located inside the pump and were undetectable without opening the pumps. These internal skimmers are becoming more common across the nation, according to the release, and are not detectible by consumers.\n\nThe skimmers were found at the Shop Quik at 529 Richards Dr. and the Shop Quik at 430 Fort Riley Blvd.\n\nRCPD encourages those who purchased gas at the pump from either location to review their bank statements for any fraudulent activity.\n\n\"The best way to protect yourself is to make it a habit to monitor your bank statements and credit reports on a regular basis,\" the release states.\n\nIf fraudulent activity is discovered on bank statements, the statement says to call dispatch at 785-537-2112 to report the crime.\n\n\"Rumors have been swirling about skimmers at other gas stations in town,\" the release states. \"Please note that no additional skimmers have been located at this time.\"\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "A new battery storage project has been announced in Germany, which could be the largest in the world. The brine4power system will be based in old salt mines and use salt caverns that were previously used as a natural gas storage facility. Each of the caverns has a volume of 3.5 million cubic feet and will give the battery a capacity of up to 700MWh at an output of 120MW. The project will use redox flow battery technology, which stores energy in liquid electrolytes. There is a positive catholyte and a negative anolyte, which are separated by a membrane that only allows ions to pass through. When charging, the ions move to the anolyte side and when discharging, they move back. This process takes up about 100 times the space per unit of energy compared to a lithium ion battery, but is much more environmentally friendly. The brine4power system stores electricity directly in the liquid, and could theoretically supply a day's worth of power to about 75,000 homes.", "Response B": "Credit card skimmers, which are devices that can gather information from credit or debit cards that are used to pay at gas station pumps, have been found at two different Manhattan gas stations in two separate calls on March 9 and March 10, according to a March 13 press release from Riley County Police Department."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": "distractor_100", "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5ffb432901d8311622530a52_64e49ad0bb8e5f820a7f857b", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "Yes", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "Yes", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No", "feedback": "None"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 2s "}}
