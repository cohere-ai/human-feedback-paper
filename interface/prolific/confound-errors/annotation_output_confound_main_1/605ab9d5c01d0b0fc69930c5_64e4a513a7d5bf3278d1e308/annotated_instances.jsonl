Here's how you can make one:\n\n1. Get a notebook or a special journal that you like. It can be any size or shape, but it should have blank pages.\n2. Choose a comfortable place to sit and think about your dreams. You can do this in your bed, on a couch, or even outside in a pretty garden.\n3. Before you go to sleep, make sure you have your journal and a pen or pencil.\n4. When you wake up, try to remember your dreams. If you can't remember anything, that's okay! Just write down any little thing you do remember, like a color or a feeling.\n5. Write down your dreams in your journal, using your own words. Don't worry too much about spelling or grammar, just focus on getting everything down on paper.\n6. If you have a dream that you really like, you can draw a picture of it too!\n7. Keep your journal by your bed so you can write in it every night.\n\nRemember, your dream journal is a special place where you can write down all your secret dreams and ideas. It's just for you, so don't worry if it's not perfect. Have fun with it, and who knows, maybe one day you'll look back and see all the amazing things you dreamed up! \ud83d\ude04", "Response B": "Of course! A dream journal is an excellent way to document and reflect on your dreams, which can be a very valuable source of self-understanding and personal growth. To create a dream journal, all you need is a notebook or journal in which to write down your dreams. It is helpful to keep the journal and a pen or pencil by your bed, and to write down your dreams as soon as you wake up, while they are still fresh in your mind. You can record any details you can remember, including images, emotions, dialogue, and plot elements. It is also helpful to re-read your previous dreams in the journal, as this can help you notice themes and patterns in your dreaming. Over time, keeping a dream journal can help you gain a deeper understanding of the meaning of your dreams, and their significance for your life and personal growth."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 112, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "605ab9d5c01d0b0fc69930c5_64e4a513a7d5bf3278d1e308", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "Yes", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "no"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 42s "}}
