{"id": "615", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Dive Brief:\n\nDeclining costs, a mature market, easy-access bandwidth and better security are making cloud data storage more attractive to K-12 districts across the U.S.\n\nCloud computing lets districts store resources online, including websites, online learning applications, and even student information systems and school-specific human resources material.\n\nMany companies offering cloud storage services also have on-demand, around-the-clock support teams ready to assist should any problems arise; yet because the cloud is now more readily available, District Administration reports that many kinks have already been worked out.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nLike any storage system, cloud storage can be used with backups to avoid running into a data nightmare. Districts have been wise to back up systems and information, even with today's much more responsive and high-functioning cloud services.\n\nPrivate clouds are also an option, but it's one that requires more preparation and labor. District administrators choosing to use private cloud storage need a high level of expertise as well as internal system support and maintenance. Network attached storage is also a cost-effective, secure alternative.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Cloud computing is becoming more appealing to U.S. K-12 districts because it's less expensive and more secure.
