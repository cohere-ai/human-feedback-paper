{"id": "26", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to turn off bold text on an iphone?", "Response A": "The \u201cAccessibility\u201d settings on your iphone include options to increase the contrast of the text on the screen, which can help with making the text easier to read.  However, the setting you want to use to turn off bold text is called \u201cReduce Motion\u201d.  To turn this feature on, open the \u201cSettings\u201d app on your iphone, then go to \u201cGeneral\u201d > \u201cAccessibility\u201d > \u201cReduce Motion\u201d.  Once you turn on \u201cReduce Motion\u201d, any animations on the iphone screen will be suppressed, and text will no longer be displayed in bold.", "Response B": "Sure, here are some things you can do on a computer without using the internet:\n\n-play solitaire or other games that come installed on the computer\n-watch movies or TV shows that you have downloaded or saved on your computer\n-listen to music that you have downloaded or saved on your computer\n-read e-books or other digital books that you have downloaded or saved on your computer\n-write or edit documents or do other types of work on the computer\n-chat with friends on a messaging or voice/video call app that does not require internet connection\n-browse educational websites that can be accessed without an internet connection (such as Wikipedia offline)\n-explore the internet using a web browser that does not require an internet connection (such as Offline Explorer)\n-learn about computers or computer programming by playing educational games or reading books and websites\n-learn about computer security by playing educational games or reading books and websites\n-edit videos or create other types of digital media"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_101", "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d7cd776c3b50b48eabd288_64e4a3e03cb42f223a1a96d2", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "1", "factors_a": "Response A gives an inaccurate answer to the question in the prompt", "factors_b": "Response B answers a completely different question"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 32s "}}
