Scanning or attempting to access other people's computers or accounts without their permission is illegal and can be considered a form of hacking or cybercrime. It is important to respect other people's privacy and security online. Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to improve your own online security and protect your personal information.\n\nIf you are concerned about your Yahoo! account security, I recommend taking the following steps:\n\n1. Use a strong and unique password for your Yahoo! account.\n2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an extra layer of security.\n3. Be cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources, as they may contain malware or phishing scams.\n4. Regularly review your account activity and update your security questions and answers.\n5. Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate strong passwords.\n\nRemember, it is important to prioritize online security and privacy, and to only engage in activities that are legal and ethical."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 108, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6346a9acc2a832b58c8e7229_64e49651e51e422dacfa740a", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "Yes", "refusal_b": "Yes", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "4", "feedback": "Both rightly refuse to give information an a dangerous topic"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 53s "}}
