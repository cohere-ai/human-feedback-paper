{"id": "696", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to butterfly shrimp?", "Response A": "Butterfly shrimp are an excellent choice of seafood, well known for their delicate flavor and tender texture.  To butterfly shrimp, you first make a shallow lengthwise cut down the back of the shrimp, being careful not to cut all the way through.  Then you gently spread the shrimp open like a butterfly, being careful not to tear the flesh.  Next, you season the shrimp with salt and pepper, and perhaps some herbs or spicy seasonings, depending on your personal taste.  Finally, you cook the shrimp gently, either by poaching, grilling, or saut\u00e9ing.  Butterfly shrimp are particularly delicious when served with a tangy sauce or salsa, such as homemade cocktail sauce or mango salsa.  Enjoy!", "Response B": "Yes, I can.  First, you need to peel the shrimp.  Then, you need to butterfly them.  To do this, you need to cut them in half down the middle, and then open them up like a book.  Then, you need to season them with salt and pepper, and then cook them in a pan with some butter.  Once they are cooked, you can serve them with some lemon wedges."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 115, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5b44a4d396bc8a0001a9c4db_64e49435cdaef18f687c6db8", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 57s "}}
