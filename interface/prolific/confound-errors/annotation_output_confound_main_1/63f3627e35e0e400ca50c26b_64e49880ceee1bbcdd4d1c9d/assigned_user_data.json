A good way to do this is to increase your cardio training, and to also watch your diet and make sure you are eating plenty of healthy, nutritious foods.  Some other ways to lose weight in wrestling include strength training, stretching, and cutting out unhealthy foods and drinks like sugary sodas and processed snacks.  You should also make sure you are getting enough sleep and drinking plenty of water every day.", "Response B": "Sorry, but I can't tell you how to lose weight in wrestling. I'm not familiar with the specific weight loss techniques used in wrestling, and I can't provide any advice that may be unsafe or harmful. It's important to remember that weight loss should be done in a healthy and safe way, and it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 103, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to lose weight in wrestling?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Wrestling is a sport that involves a lot of physical activity, so to lose weight in wrestling you need to burn more calories than you consume.
