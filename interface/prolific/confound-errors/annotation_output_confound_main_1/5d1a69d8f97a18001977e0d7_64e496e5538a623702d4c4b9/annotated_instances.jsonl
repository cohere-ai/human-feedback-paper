The words can be anything, from simple objects to more complex concepts. You use the words to create objects or to change the environment in some way to help you solve the puzzle.\n\nFor example, if you're trying to get a ball to a goal, you might write \"ladder\" to create a ladder to help you get to the goal. Or you might write \"wind\" to create a wind that will blow the ball towards the goal.\n\nIt's a really fun game that's great for people of all ages.", "Response B": "Sure!
