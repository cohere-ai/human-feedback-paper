{"610": {"id": "610", "text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to play scribblenauts?", "Response A": "Sure! Scribblenauts is a puzzle game where you have to write words to solve the puzzles. The words can be anything, from simple objects to more complex concepts. You use the words to create objects or to change the environment in some way to help you solve the puzzle.\n\nFor example, if you're trying to get a ball to a goal, you might write \"ladder\" to create a ladder to help you get to the goal. Or you might write \"wind\" to create a wind that will blow the ball towards the goal.\n\nIt's a really fun game that's great for people of all ages.", "Response B": "Sure! Scribblenauts is a game where you use your imagination to solve puzzles. You can create anything you want to help you solve the puzzle, and the only limit is your imagination. The game is very fun and creative, and it's a great way to exercise your brain."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 120, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to play scribblenauts?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure!
