{"id": "734", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Dive Brief:\n\nDeclining costs, a mature market, easy-access bandwidth and better security are making cloud data storage more attractive to K-12 districts across the U.S.\n\nCloud computing lets districts store resources online, including websites, online learning applications, and even student information systems and school-specific human resources material.\n\nMany companies offering cloud storage services also have on-demand, around-the-clock support teams ready to assist should any problems arise; yet because the cloud is now more readily available, District Administration reports that many kinks have already been worked out.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nLike any storage system, cloud storage can be used with backups to avoid running into a data nightmare. Districts have been wise to back up systems and information, even with today's much more responsive and high-functioning cloud services.\n\nPrivate clouds are also an option, but it's one that requires more preparation and labor. District administrators choosing to use private cloud storage need a high level of expertise as well as internal system support and maintenance. Network attached storage is also a cost-effective, secure alternative.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The U.S. Department of Education has provided $17m in grants to fund the development of educational applications that will be hosted on the cloud, and in turn, help students with disabilities. The grants, provided by the Cloud Computing Initiative, will fund projects to create applications that are accessible to students with a range of disabilities, including those with visual impairments, speech impairments, and cognitive disabilities. The applications will be hosted on the cloud, which will allow for easy access and updates. The Department of Education hopes that the grants will help to increase the use of cloud-based applications in education and improve the accessibility of education for students with disabilities.", "Response B": "In the article, the author discusses the benefits of cloud computing for K-12 districts. Declining costs, a mature market, easy-access bandwidth, and better security make cloud storage more attractive to schools. The article mentions that many companies offering cloud storage services also have on-demand support teams ready to assist if any problems arise. However, because the cloud is now more readily available, many kinks have already been worked out. It's important to backup data to avoid running into data nightmares. Private clouds are another option, but it requires more preparation and labor. District administrators should consider using internal system support and maintenance if choosing this option. Network attached storage is also a cost-effective, secure alternative."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 101, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "58df8008167bc20001b4ae12_64e49297681046d5f6983813", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 26s "}}
