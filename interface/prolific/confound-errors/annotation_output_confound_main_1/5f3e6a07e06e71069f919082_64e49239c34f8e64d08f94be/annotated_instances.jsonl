A dream journal is an excellent way to document and reflect on your dreams, which can be a very valuable source of self-understanding and personal growth. To create a dream journal, all you need is a notebook or journal in which to write down your dreams. It is helpful to keep the journal and a pen or pencil by your bed, and to write down your dreams as soon as you wake up, while they are still fresh in your mind. You can record any details you can remember, including images, emotions, dialogue, and plot elements. It is also helpful to re-read your previous dreams in the journal, as this can help you notice themes and patterns in your dreaming. Over time, keeping a dream journal can help you gain a deeper understanding of the meaning of your dreams, and their significance for your life and personal growth."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 112, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5f3e6a07e06e71069f919082_64e49239c34f8e64d08f94be", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "it gave an ordered list", "factors_b": "no"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 44s "}}
