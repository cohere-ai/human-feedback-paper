{"id": "287", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to buy a condo?", "Response A": "The process of buying a condo usually starts with researching different neighborhoods and communities that fit your needs and budget. Once you have found a few options, you can start working with a real estate agent who can guide you through the process of finding and purchasing a condo. It's important to have a good understanding of your finances and credit score before starting the process, as well as to communicate with your agent about any specific needs or wants you have for your new home.", "Response B": "Sure! First you need to decide what neighborhood you want to live in, and then you need to find a realtor you want to work with. You can look at condos online or in person, and when you find one you like you can make an offer. The seller can accept, reject, or counteroffer. Once you and the seller agree on a price and terms, you\u2019ll close on the condo and become the new owner!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 110, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5b59ea857ac6d70001aae449_64e4a34c49168f93c752428d", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "Level of detail", "factors_b": "Level of detail and tone, it's a bit more casual than response a - less helpful", "feedback": "N/A"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 10s "}}
