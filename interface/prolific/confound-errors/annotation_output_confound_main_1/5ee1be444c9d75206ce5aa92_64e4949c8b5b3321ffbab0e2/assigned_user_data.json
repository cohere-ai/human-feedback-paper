It depends on how much weight you want to lose, and how quickly.  If you are trying to lose just a few pounds, you might want to try cutting out sugary drinks and foods like candy and cake.  If you have more weight to lose, and can do it more gradually, you might want to cut out all processed foods, and make healthier food choices.  You might also want to consider taking up a new hobby that will help you burn calories, such as running, swimming, or wrestling."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 103, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to lose weight in wrestling?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Thank you for reaching out with your question!
