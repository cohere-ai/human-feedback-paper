To tweet using native SMS services, you need to set up your phone to send and receive text messages from Twitter. To do this, go to your phone's settings and look for the option to add a new messaging account. From there, select Twitter as the messaging service and follow the instructions to set it up. Once it's set up, you can tweet by sending a text message to Twitter's short code (40404 in the US and Canada, and 646464 in the UK). Your tweet will be sent as a text message to your followers.", "Response B": "To tweet using native SMS services, you can send a text message to the designated phone number of your mobile carrier with your tweet. The message should follow a specific syntax, which varies depending on the carrier. It is recommended to use simple language and short words to avoid any errors or delays in the process. Additionally, you may need to register your phone number with your carrier in order to use this service."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 106, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to tweet using native sms services?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure!
