Section 520(o)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, states that software that is intended \"for maintaining or encouraging a healthy lifestyle and is unrelated to the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, prevention, or treatment of a disease or condition\" is not a device under section 201(h) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThis guidance clarifies FDA's interpretation of this provision and its application to general wellness products.\n\n1 This guidance does not change or rescind any requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) or any applicable regulations.
