{"id": "538", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to avoid gossiping?", "Response A": "Shift the conversation to a new topic or simply ignore it if possible. If you notice someone else gossiping, redirect the conversation to a more positive topic or address the behavior directly if you feel comfortable doing so.", "Response B": "Sure, I can give you some tips on how to avoid gossiping. \n\nFirst, it's important to be aware of your own thoughts and feelings about the people around you. If you feel like you might be gossiping, try to take a step back and ask yourself why you're feeling that way. It's possible that you're just being paranoid or overreacting, and that the person you're thinking about isn't actually gossiping about you. \n\nIf you're still feeling like you might be gossiping, try to avoid engaging in the conversation. This might mean saying something like, \"I don't want to talk about that\" or \"I'm not comfortable talking about that.\" \n\nIt's also important to be aware of the people around you and to try to avoid talking to them about sensitive topics. This might mean avoiding people who are known to be gossipers or who are particularly sensitive about certain topics. \n\nFinally, it's important to be honest with the people around you and to try to avoid gossiping. This might mean being upfront about your feelings or being honest about the topic you're discussing. \n\nI hope these tips help you avoid gossiping."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 114, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6346a9acc2a832b58c8e7229_64e49a5bc0bc1e12c23ba06b", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 6s "}}
