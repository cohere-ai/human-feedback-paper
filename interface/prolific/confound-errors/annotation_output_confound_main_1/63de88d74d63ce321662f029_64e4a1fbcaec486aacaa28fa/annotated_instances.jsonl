{"id": "328", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to read the mounts of the palm?", "Response A": "Palmistry, also known as chiromancy or palm reading, is the art of interpreting the lines, shapes, and curves on the palm of your hand to gain insight into your personality, future, and life path. There are several different lines and mounts on the palm that palm readers use to interpret your personality, including the life line, heart line, head line, and fate line. Each of these lines has its own meaning and significance, and their placement and shape can provide valuable information about your life and experiences. To learn more about palm reading and how to interpret your own palm, there are many books, websites, and online courses available.", "Response B": "I\u2019ve actually never really looked at the mount of the palm before. I\u2019ve heard of it, but I don\u2019t know much about it. I could try to find some information and get back to you, if you\u2019d like."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 105, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63de88d74d63ce321662f029_64e4a1fbcaec486aacaa28fa", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "Yes", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "1", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 20s "}}
