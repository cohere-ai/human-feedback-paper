{"id": "541", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to avoid gossiping?", "Response A": "Shift the conversation to a new topic or simply ignore it if possible. If you notice someone else gossiping, redirect the conversation to a more positive topic or address the behavior directly if you feel comfortable doing so.", "Response B": "Sure! Here are some tips on how to avoid gossiping:\n\n1. Be aware of your own tendencies to gossip. If you find yourself frequently engaging in gossip, try to identify the triggers that cause you to do so. Once you know what these triggers are, you can start to work on avoiding them.\n\n2. Set boundaries with gossipers. If someone tries to engage you in gossip, be firm and tell them that you do not want to participate. You can also try to change the subject or walk away from the conversation.\n\n3. Find alternative ways to spend your time. Instead of gossiping, try to find activities that are more productive and positive. This could include things like reading, working on a hobby, or spending time with friends and family.\n\n4. Seek support. If you are struggling to avoid gossiping, consider seeking support from a trusted friend or therapist. They can help you work through the underlying issues that may be causing you to engage in gossip, and provide you with strategies for changing your behavior."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 114, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6266a4e5846e1e41812a0432_64e49a325f8a8fc3f7f19cb2", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "I scored it a 2 as it was very brief with very little detail", "factors_b": "I scored it high as the detail was good and it gave many options"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 40s "}}
