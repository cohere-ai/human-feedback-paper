They are often seen as weak or vulnerable.\n\nTo avoid being a pushover, you should try to be more confident and assertive. This will help you to stand up for yourself and to say no to things that you don't want to do.\n\nYou should also try to be more independent and self-sufficient. This will help you to feel more in control of your own life and to be less likely to be pushed around by others.\n\nFinally, you should try to be more informed and educated about the world around you. This will help you to make better decisions and to be more confident in your own abilities.", "Response B": "To avoid being a pushover, it's important to set boundaries, practice saying 'no' when necessary, and prioritize your own needs and values. It can also be helpful to work on your self-confidence and assertiveness skills, and to seek support from friends or professionals if needed. Remember, it's okay to be firm and assertive without being aggressive or mean."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 124, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "58df8008167bc20001b4ae12_64e49d3a9d6755c0cbc6be6d", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 48s "}}
