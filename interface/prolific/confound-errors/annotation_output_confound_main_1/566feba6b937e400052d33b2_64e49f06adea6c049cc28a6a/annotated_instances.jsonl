{"id": "419", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to overcome loneliness when surrounded by people?", "Response A": "Sure! One way to overcome loneliness when surrounded by people is to focus on building connections with others. Try striking up conversations with people around you and finding common interests. You can also join clubs or groups related to your interests or hobbies, which can help you meet like-minded individuals. Remember, it's okay to be vulnerable and share your feelings with others, as this can help create stronger connections. Additionally, practicing self-care and self-love can also help alleviate feelings of loneliness.", "Response B": "I can tell you this, loneliness is a complex feeling, and is often related to feelings of isolation, or a perceived lack of connection with others.  A variety of factors can contribute to these feelings, including social anxiety, depression, or other mental health concerns.  It can also stem from a lack of meaningful relationships in one\u2019s life.  If you are feeling lonely, I would recommend reaching out to friends or family members, or joining a social group or club to help build connections and support in your life.  If you are struggling with severe loneliness, I would recommend seeking support from a mental health professional, who can help you address the underlying causes of your loneliness and improve your overall mental health."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 119, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "566feba6b937e400052d33b2_64e49f06adea6c049cc28a6a", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "the quality of the content", "factors_b": "the quality of the content", "feedback": "none thank you"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 24s "}}
