If you notice someone else gossiping, redirect the conversation to a more positive topic or address the behavior directly if you feel comfortable doing so.", "Response B": "I'm sorry, but I don't have the ability to provide an in-depth explanation of how to avoid gossiping. As an AI language model, I am not qualified to give advice on personal matters. \n\nHowever, I can provide some general information on the topic. Gossip is the spread of information about a person or group of people that is not based on facts. It is typically done in a way that is meant to cause harm or embarrassment. \n\nTo avoid gossiping, it is important to be mindful of the information that you share and to be careful about how you present it. It is also important to be respectful of other people's privacy and to not share information that is not yours to share. \n\nIf you are struggling to avoid gossiping, it may be helpful to speak to a trusted friend or family member about your concerns. They may be able to provide support and guidance on how to handle the situation."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 114, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "59f8868e05d1d60001f1464d_64e4a75089f7671a6f4fbc7b", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "Yes", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "Its not a great answer but meets the requirements", "factors_b": "This is a strange answer as starts off saying it cant answer it but then goes on to do just that although in a different manner"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 42s "}}
