The result will be a wireless operator with nearly 400 million customers -- roughly 75 million more than the entire population of the U.S.\n\nVodafone (VOD) will own a stake of about 45% in the new business, which the companies are valuing at more than $23 billion, including debt. The U.K. firm will share control with Idea's owner, the Aditya Birla Group.\n\nRelated: Apple is set to start making iPhones in India\n\nThe deal, which follows months of talks, will give both companies a leg up in India's cut-throat telecom market.\n\nThe entry of new player Reliance Jio last year -- bankrolled by India's richest man who offered six months of free 4G internet -- set off a price war that left Vodafone, Idea and industry leader Bharti Airtel scrambling. Last November, Vodafone reported a $5 billion loss in India as a result.\n\nInvestors were unsure what to make of the Vodafone-Idea deal at first glance.\n\nIdea's stock fluctuated wildly in Mumbai on Monday, leaping 15% initially but then plunging into negative territory to trade down around 9% by early afternoon. Vodafone's share price in London was little changed in early trading.\n\nRelated: India is planning to give free WiFi to more than 1,000 villages\n\nMonday's deal will allow the U.K.-based firm to reduce its exposure to the troubled Indian business, it said.\n\nIndia still offers huge opportunities for telecom operators in the long term.
