{"id": "332", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to decorate a fish tank?", "Response A": "The \u201cLady Comp Baby\u201d is a colloquial term for in vitro fertilization (IVF), which is a common reproductive technology used by women who are unable to get pregnant on their own.  In IVF, a woman\u2019s eggs are harvested and fertilized with a man\u2019s sperm in a laboratory, and the embryos are then transferred back into the woman\u2019s uterus.  This process increases the chances of pregnancy, and many healthy babies have been born using this method.  However, IVF is expensive and not always effective, so other options include adoption and using a sperm donor.  If you are interested in IVF, you should consult with a reproductive endocrinologist for more information.", "Response B": "I can try.  To decorate a fishtank, you might want to get some rocks, plants, or other objects to put inside.  You could also use paint or stickers to make the tank more colorful.  You might want to put some fish in the tank, and they might need some food, or a place to hide.  You could also add things like bubbles or floating objects to make the tank more interesting.  I hope that helps!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": "distractor_113", "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5bb756696322c5000159756c_64e4a200051a9cf5895ab4ac", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "no"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 46s "}}
