{"id": "0", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to bowl?", "Response A": "Sure! Bowling is a game that involves rolling a heavy ball down a lane towards a set of pins. The objective is to knock over as many pins as possible. \n\nTo bowl, you will need a bowling ball, a set of bowling pins, and a lane. You can find these items at most bowling alleys.\n\nTo begin, you will need to position the bowling ball at the head of the lane. You can then roll the ball down the lane towards the pins. The pins will be knocked over as the ball rolls down the lane.\n\nOnce the ball has reached the pins, you will need to adjust your aim and roll the ball again. You can continue to roll the ball until all of the pins have been knocked over.\n\nIt's important to note that bowling is a game of skill and precision. You will need to practice and develop your technique to become a better bowler.", "Response B": "Of course! Bowling is a fun and accessible activity that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels. Here are some steps to help you get started:\n\n1. Choose your ball: Select a ball that feels comfortable in your hand and is the right size for you. Most bowling alleys offer balls in different weights and sizes, so don't be afraid to ask for help choosing one that's right for you.\n2. Stand in the correct position: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, with one foot slightly in front of the other. Keep your body straight and your arms relaxed.\n3. Hold the ball correctly: Place your dominant hand on the ball with your fingers spread evenly and your thumb in the ball's largest hole. Your other hand should be on the side of the ball, with your fingers curled around it.\n4. Take a deep breath: Before you start your approach, take a deep breath and focus on your target.\n5. Start your approach: Begin your approach by taking small steps, keeping your body straight and your arms relaxed. As you get closer to the foul line, take longer strides and start to swing your arm back.\n6. Swing the ball: Swing the ball back and then forward, using your arm and body to generate power. Keep your elbow in and your wrist straight.\n7. Release the ball: Release the ball at the appropriate moment, using a smooth and controlled motion. Aim to release the ball when your arm is almost fully extended.\n8. Follow through: After you release the ball, follow through with your arm and body. This will help you maintain balance and generate more power.\n9. Keep score: Keep track of your scores as you play, and don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the experience. With practice and patience, you'll be bowling like a pro in no time!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 111, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5ffb432901d8311622530a52_64e4acff3517f955ff548da5", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No", "feedback": "None"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 24s "}}
