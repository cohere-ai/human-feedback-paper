Districts have been wise to back up systems and information, even with today's much more responsive and high-functioning cloud services.\n\nPrivate clouds are also an option, but it's one that requires more preparation and labor. District administrators choosing to use private cloud storage need a high level of expertise as well as internal system support and maintenance. Network attached storage is also a cost-effective, secure alternative.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "In the article, the author discusses the benefits of cloud computing for K-12 districts. Declining costs, a mature market, easy-access bandwidth, and better security make cloud storage more attractive to schools. The article mentions that many companies offering cloud storage services also have on-demand support teams ready to assist if any problems arise. However, because the cloud is now more readily available, many kinks have already been worked out. It's important to backup data to avoid running into data nightmares. Private clouds are another option, but it requires more preparation and labor. District administrators should consider using internal system support and maintenance if choosing this option. Network attached storage is also a cost-effective, secure alternative.", "Response B": "Cloud computing is becoming more and more popular in schools across the US as it is more affordable and secure. The cloud allows schools to store resources online, including websites and learning applications. Many cloud storage companies offer support teams to help with any issues that may arise."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 101, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "62b44f66a16d45783569fad6_64e4a09e6ea95e98a7fbbde3", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 32s "}}
