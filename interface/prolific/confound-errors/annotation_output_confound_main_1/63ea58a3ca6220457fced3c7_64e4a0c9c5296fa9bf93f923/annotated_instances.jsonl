{"id": "369", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to remove mineral spots from fabric?", "Response A": "Sure, this is actually a very common problem in textile manufacturing, and there are a number of standard methods that can be used to remove these spots.  In general the method that will work best depends on the type of fabric and the specific type of spot, so it is important to first identify the type of spot.  The most common types of mineral spots include calcium carbonate, calcium oxalate, and calcium phosphate.  For most types of spots, the recommended treatment is a wash with a solution of sodium carbonate and sodium chloride.  For calcium oxalate spots, it is usually best to use a hot aqueous oxalic acid solution, and for calcium phosphate spots a hot aqueous phosphoric acid solution is typically recommended.  In addition to these chemical treatments, various commercial enzymatic washes are also available which can be effective for removing mineral spots.  It is important to note that some types of mineral spots can be very difficult or impossible to remove using standard methods, and in these cases it may be necessary to resort to more specialized treatments.", "Response B": "There are several methods to remove mineral spots from fabric, depending on the type of fabric and the severity of the stain. Some methods include using a mixture of vinegar and water, lemon juice and salt, or a commercial stain remover. It's important to test any solution on a small, inconspicuous area of the fabric first to make sure it doesn't cause any damage or discoloration. Additionally, it's always a good idea to follow the care label instructions for the fabric to ensure the best results."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 104, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63ea58a3ca6220457fced3c7_64e4a0c9c5296fa9bf93f923", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "Yes", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "Yes", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "Good ", "factors_b": "Optional "}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 42s "}}
