You\u2019ll work with them to determine your budget and what features you\u2019re looking for in a property, and then they\u2019ll help you find and make an offer on a condo that meets your criteria.  If you\u2019re buying as an investment, you\u2019ll want to work with a real estate agent or property manager who can help you find a property that will generate income as a rental.", "Response B": "The process of buying a condo usually starts with researching different neighborhoods and communities that fit your needs and budget. Once you have found a few options, you can start working with a real estate agent who can guide you through the process of finding and purchasing a condo.
