It can also be helpful to work on your self-confidence and assertiveness skills, and to seek support from friends or professionals if needed. Remember, it's okay to be firm and assertive without being aggressive or mean.", "Response B": "Practice saying 'no' more often, and don't be afraid to express your needs and wants. Set boundaries and stick to them. Use language that is direct and clear, and avoid being overly apologetic or passive. It's important to maintain your integrity and not compromise your values, but also to be open to feedback and willing to compromise when necessary. If you find it difficult to be assertive or set boundaries, consider seeking the help of a therapist or counselor to work through any underlying issues."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 124, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to avoid being a pushover?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            To avoid being a pushover, it's important to set boundaries, practice saying 'no' when necessary, and prioritize your own needs and values.
