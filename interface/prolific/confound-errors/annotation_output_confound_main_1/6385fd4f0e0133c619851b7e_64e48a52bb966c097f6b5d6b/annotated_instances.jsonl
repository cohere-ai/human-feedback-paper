To tweet using native SMS services, you need to set up your phone to send and receive text messages from Twitter. To do this, go to your phone's settings and look for the option to add a new messaging account. From there, select Twitter as the messaging service and follow the instructions to set it up. Once it's set up, you can tweet by sending a text message to Twitter's short code (40404 in the US and Canada, and 646464 in the UK).
