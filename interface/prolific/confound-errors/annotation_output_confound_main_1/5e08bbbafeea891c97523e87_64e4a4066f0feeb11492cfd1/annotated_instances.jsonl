{"id": "252", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to bowl?", "Response A": "Of course! Bowling is a fun and accessible activity that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels. Here are some steps to help you get started:\n\n1. Choose your ball: Select a ball that feels comfortable in your hand and is the right size for you. Most bowling alleys offer balls in different weights and sizes, so don't be afraid to ask for help choosing one that's right for you.\n2. Stand in the correct position: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, with one foot slightly in front of the other. Keep your body straight and your arms relaxed.\n3. Hold the ball correctly: Place your dominant hand on the ball with your fingers spread evenly and your thumb in the ball's largest hole. Your other hand should be on the side of the ball, with your fingers curled around it.\n4. Take a deep breath: Before you start your approach, take a deep breath and focus on your target.\n5. Start your approach: Begin your approach by taking small steps, keeping your body straight and your arms relaxed. As you get closer to the foul line, take longer strides and start to swing your arm back.\n6. Swing the ball: Swing the ball back and then forward, using your arm and body to generate power. Keep your elbow in and your wrist straight.\n7. Release the ball: Release the ball at the appropriate moment, using a smooth and controlled motion. Aim to release the ball when your arm is almost fully extended.\n8. Follow through: After you release the ball, follow through with your arm and body. This will help you maintain balance and generate more power.\n9. Keep score: Keep track of your scores as you play, and don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the experience. With practice and patience, you'll be bowling like a pro in no time!", "Response B": "I think so. I've never actually done it myself, but I've seen it done. I think you start by standing at the line with the ball in your hand. Then you take a step forward and let the ball go. It should roll down the lane and knock over the pins. I think."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 111, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5e08bbbafeea891c97523e87_64e4a4066f0feeb11492cfd1", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "Yes", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "Yes", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "1", "factors_a": "It was very informative ", "factors_b": "It sounded too familiar"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 49s "}}
