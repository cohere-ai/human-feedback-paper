{"id": "398", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Dive Brief:\n\nDeclining costs, a mature market, easy-access bandwidth and better security are making cloud data storage more attractive to K-12 districts across the U.S.\n\nCloud computing lets districts store resources online, including websites, online learning applications, and even student information systems and school-specific human resources material.\n\nMany companies offering cloud storage services also have on-demand, around-the-clock support teams ready to assist should any problems arise; yet because the cloud is now more readily available, District Administration reports that many kinks have already been worked out.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nLike any storage system, cloud storage can be used with backups to avoid running into a data nightmare. Districts have been wise to back up systems and information, even with today's much more responsive and high-functioning cloud services.\n\nPrivate clouds are also an option, but it's one that requires more preparation and labor. District administrators choosing to use private cloud storage need a high level of expertise as well as internal system support and maintenance. Network attached storage is also a cost-effective, secure alternative.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Based on the information provided, it appears that cloud data storage is becoming more attractive to K-12 districts in the United States due to declining costs, a mature market, easy-access bandwidth, and better security. This shift towards cloud storage has led to the development of on-demand support teams and the ability to backup systems and information to avoid data nightmares. Additionally, private clouds and network attached storage are also options, but they require more preparation and expertise. However, I would like to emphasize the importance of caution and careful consideration when selecting a cloud storage solution to ensure the security and privacy of sensitive information. Is there anything else you would like to know?", "Response B": "Sure! Here is a summary of the article you provided:\n\nSony Pictures has settled a class action lawsuit filed by employees who feared identity theft after a catastrophic hacking attack last winter.
