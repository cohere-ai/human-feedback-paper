Gossip is often harmful and can cause significant damage to relationships, so it is important to do what you can to avoid participating in it.  Some helpful strategies include simply refraining from sharing or repeating gossip, being careful about what you say and avoiding judgmental or negative comments about others, and actively working to build positive relationships with others based on trust and respect.  You may also find it helpful to limit the amount of time you spend with gossiping friends or coworkers, as this can help reduce the temptation to engage in this behavior.  Additionally, some people find it helpful to engage in positive activities such as volunteering or exercising, which can help distract you from gossip and improve your overall well-being.", "Response B": "Shift the conversation to a new topic or simply ignore it if possible.
