{"id": "172", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make pumpkin pancakes?", "Response A": "Sure, here is a recipe for pumpkin pancakes:\n\n1. Combine 1 1/2 cups of flour, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and a pinch of salt in a large bowl.\n\n2. In a separate bowl, whisk together 2 eggs, 1 cup of milk, 1/2 cup of pumpkin, and 2 tablespoons of melted butter.\n\n3. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the egg mixture.\n\n4. Stir gently until just combined.\n\n5. Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto a hot griddle or skillet.\n\n6. Cook until golden brown, and serve with maple syrup.", "Response B": "Sure, I can try to help you with that. I think you'll need some pumpkin puree, eggs, milk, flour, sugar, baking powder, and a few other ingredients. You'll also need a griddle or a frying pan, and some butter or oil to cook the pancakes in.\n\nTo make the pancakes, you'll first need to mix together the dry ingredients, then add the wet ingredients and mix until the batter is smooth. Then, you'll need to heat up the griddle or frying pan over medium heat, and add a little butter or oil to the pan. Once the butter or oil is hot, you can add the batter to the pan in 1/4 cup increments, and cook the pancakes for a few minutes on each side until they are golden brown and cooked through.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 109, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "605ab9d5c01d0b0fc69930c5_64e4a6716842d5182743e17b", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "no"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 39s "}}
