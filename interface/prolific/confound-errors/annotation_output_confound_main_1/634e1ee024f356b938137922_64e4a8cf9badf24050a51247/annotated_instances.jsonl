Scrabble is a word game where you and your opponent take turns forming words on a board using tiles. The words can be any combination of letters, and they can be used to score points. The game ends when one player has no more tiles left.\n\nTo play, you and your opponent take turns forming words on the board. Each word must be made up of letters that are in the correct order and that can be used to score points. For example, the word \"cat\" would not be a valid word because it is not made up of the correct order of letters.\n\nYou can also use special tiles to score extra points. For example, the word \"car\" would be a valid word, but you could also use the tile \"c\" to score an extra point.\n\nThe game ends when one player has no more tiles left. At this point, the player with the most points wins."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 120, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "634e1ee024f356b938137922_64e4a8cf9badf24050a51247", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 14s "}}
