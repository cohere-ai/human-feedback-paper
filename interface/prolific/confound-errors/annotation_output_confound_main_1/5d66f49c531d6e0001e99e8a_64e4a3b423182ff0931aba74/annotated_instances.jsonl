{"id": "267", "input_text": {"Prompt": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As new employees were brought into Apple's secret effort to create a self-driving car a few years ago, managers told them that they were working on the company's next big thing: A product that would take on Detroit and disrupt the automobile industry.\n\nThese days, Apple's automotive ambitions are more modest. The company has put off any notion of an Apple-branded autonomous vehicle and is instead working on the underlying technology that allows a car to drive itself. Timothy D. Cook, the company's chief executive, said in an interview with Bloomberg in June that Apple is \"focusing on autonomous systems.\"\n\nA notable symbol of that retrenchment is a self-driving shuttle service that ferries employees from one Apple building to another. The shuttle, which has never been reported before, will likely be a commercial vehicle from an automaker and Apple will use it to test the autonomous driving technology that it develops.\n\nFive people familiar with Apple's car project, code-named \"Titan,\" discussed with The New York Times the missteps that led the tech giant to move \u2014 at least for now \u2014 from creating a self-driving Apple car to creating technology for a car that someone else builds. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about Apple's plans.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "As an assistant, I would like to point out that the article discusses Apple's shift in focus from creating an autonomous Apple car to developing autonomous driving technology for other car manufacturers. The reason for this change in direction is reportedly due to missteps and setbacks in the project, known as \"Titan.\" The article highlights that the company is now working on a self-driving shuttle service to test its technology, and that the project is being led by Timothy D. Cook.\n\nI would like to emphasize that the information provided is based on sources familiar with the project, and that Apple has not made any official statements regarding the specifics of its car project. Additionally, the article notes that the project is focused on developing autonomous driving technology, rather than creating a self-driving Apple car.\n\nAs an assistant, I would recommend approaching this topic with caution and respect for the company's privacy and confidentiality. It is important to rely on credible sources and to refrain from spreading misinformation or speculation. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.", "Response B": "Apple had a secret project called Titan to create a self-driving car a few years ago. But now Apple has put off any notion of an Apple-branded autonomous vehicle and is working on the underlying technology that allows a car to drive itself. Also, Apple is using a self-driving shuttle service to ferry employees from one Apple building to another to test the autonomous driving technology it develops."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 116, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d66f49c531d6e0001e99e8a_64e4a3b423182ff0931aba74", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "I based my score on the response talking about being an assistant and giving it's own opinion which confused me.", "factors_b": "n/a"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 2s "}}
