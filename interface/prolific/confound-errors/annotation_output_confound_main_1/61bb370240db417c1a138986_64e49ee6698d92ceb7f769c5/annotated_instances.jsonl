About 170 robots will be deployed in the early 2020s. The budget for the development is estimated to be less than 500 billion won. The development will start in 2017. The demining robots will be used not only for removing landmines in the DMZ but also for handling explosives. The plan is in response to the North Korean landmine attack that wounded two South Korean soldiers in the DMZ. The military will also develop 100 unmanned vehicles for search operations in the DMZ.", "Response B": "Sure! Here is a summary of the article using short words and simple language:\n\nThe military is making new robots to find and remove dangerous things in a special place called the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The robots will help keep people safe. There will be 170 robots and it will cost less than $431 million. This is important because some people got hurt from a dangerous thing called a landmine. The military wants to make sure everyone is safe."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 123, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "61bb370240db417c1a138986_64e49ee6698d92ceb7f769c5", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "4", "feedback": "I rated response B only a 4 out of 5, although it accurately provided a summary, it appeared to assume the summary was meant for a young child, instead of simply summarising the text as is."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 40s "}}
