Apply the mixture to the spot and let it soak for a few minutes. Then, blot the area with a clean cloth to remove any excess liquid. You can also try using a commercial stain remover, following the instructions on the package. It's important to always test any new cleaning solution on an inconspicuous area of the fabric beforehand to avoid any damage or discoloration."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_112", "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5eff6065cc8d32014292657f_64e4a0e89fbccff046cbe6be", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "1", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 42s "}}
