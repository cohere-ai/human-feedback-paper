What happened?\nNova: Well, I don't really know, but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months, and filed for divorce.\nBlake: That's really surprising. I always thought they are well matched. What about the kids? Who get custody?\nNova: Masha, it seems quiet and makable, no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out.\nBlake: That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about. Well, I still can't believe it, Masha and Hero, the perfect couple. When would they divorce be final?\nNova: Early in the New Year I guess.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "Nova tells Blake that Masha and Hero are getting divorced.
