First you need to open a terminal window, which you can do by going to Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal.

You can replace the character on the third line with any other unicode character you\u2019d like to print.  To save your changes, just close the file in your editor.  To run the script, you can double-click on the file, or type the following in a terminal window:\n./mkroman\n\nThis will print the string with the unicode character that you specified in the file.  If you\u2019d like to make this accessible from the keyboard, you can create an Automator application that runs the script, or you can create a keyboard shortcut that runs the script.
