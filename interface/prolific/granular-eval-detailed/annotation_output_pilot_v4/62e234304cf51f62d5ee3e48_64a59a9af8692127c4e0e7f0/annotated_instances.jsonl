{"id": "2", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to find a hidden unicode maker on your computer?", "Response A": "Sure, I can help with that!  First you need to open a terminal window, which you can do by going to Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal.  In the terminal window, type the following command:\nmkroman\n\nThis will create a new file called \u2018mkroman\u2019 in the directory that you are currently in.  Next, open the \u2018mkroman\u2019 file in your preferred text editor, such as TextEdit or Sublime Text.  You\u2019ll see something like the following:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho -n \"This is a Unicode arrow pointing to the upper right: \"\necho -n \"\\u2192\"\n\nThe first line is a \u201cshebang\u201d line that tells the computer what program to use to run the script.  The second line just prints a string, and the third line is the important one: it prints the unicode character that looks like an arrow pointing to the upper right.  You can replace the character on the third line with any other unicode character you\u2019d like to print.  To save your changes, just close the file in your editor.  To run the script, you can double-click on the file, or type the following in a terminal window:\n./mkroman\n\nThis will print the string with the unicode character that you specified in the file.  If you\u2019d like to make this accessible from the keyboard, you can create an Automator application that runs the script, or you can create a keyboard shortcut that runs the script.  I hope", "Response B": "Go to \"Start\".\nType in what your code was.\nClose out the unicode maker."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "pilot_batch_v4_shuffled_mpt", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 2}, "label_annotations": {"email": "62e234304cf51f62d5ee3e48_64a59a9af8692127c4e0e7f0", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "3", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "1", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "1", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "2", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 10m 43s "}}
