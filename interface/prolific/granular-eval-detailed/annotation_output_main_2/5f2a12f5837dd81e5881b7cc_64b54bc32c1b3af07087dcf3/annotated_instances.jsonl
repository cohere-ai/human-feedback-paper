{"id": "640", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Conversation:\nJessica: Are you going to the demonstration to help stop the spread of nuclear weapons tomorrow, Cleo?\nBen: No, Simon. I hate demonstrations. I have heard the police will be standing by with tear gas.\nJessica: Yes, but North Korea boasts it has nuclear arms.\nBen: One hundred ninety countries have signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty but the issues are just too complex. There are two sides to every story. I don't understand it and I have no intention of going to a demonstration. Demonstrations don't seem to accomplish anything anyway.\nJessica: Several demonstrations have changed politician's minds throughout history. As a responsible citizen I think it is important to stand up for what you believe in.\nBen: Leave it to someone else. As I said, if you listen to both sides of a story, both sides have some good points. Why should I demonstrate and risk getting hurt for something that I am not even sure is right?\nJessica: You are not likely to get hurt. This will be a peaceful demonstration. I have spoken to the organizer for the university group. He insists that this will be peaceful. He advocates if you want world peace, peace begins at home-and that means right here in this city.\nBen: You go if you want, Simon, but I plan to study for my physics exam.\nJessica: It would only take two hours of your day. The bus leaves the campus at 11:30 and leaves downtown to return to campus at 12:45. You could eat your lunch on the bus.\nBen: I am not going, Simon. Why don't you ask the students in your political science class this afternoon if they want to go?\nJessica: They are all going.\nBen: Okay, Simon. I need to meet my sister for coffee now.\nJessica: Bye then. See you in physics class tomorrow.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "Jessica and Simon are discussing whether to go to the demonstration tomorrow to help stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Ben is not going, as he hates demonstrations. Simon suggests that he ask the students in his political science class if they want to go.", "Response B": "Jessica and Ben discuss whether or not to go to a demonstration to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Ben doesn't want to go because he hates demonstrations and thinks they don't accomplish anything. Jessica thinks it's important to stand up for what you believe in and that demonstrations have changed politician's minds throughout history. Ben still doesn't want to go, but Jessica says she will go anyway."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "dialogsum", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 36}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5f2a12f5837dd81e5881b7cc_64b54bc32c1b3af07087dcf3", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "3", "confidence_b": "3", "useful_a": "1", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "1", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "2", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "3", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "No.", "factors_b": "No.", "feedback": "Ben repeatedly refers to Jessica as \"Simon.\""}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 6m 45s "}}
