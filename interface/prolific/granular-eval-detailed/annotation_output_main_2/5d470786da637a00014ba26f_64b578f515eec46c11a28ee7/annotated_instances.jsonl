{"id": "149", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Here's new tech that'll make wearables as non-invasive as a Band-Aid. Japanese researchers have created a printable conducive ink on cloth, which means your boxer briefs or sports bra could one day track your heart rate (among other things).\n\nIn an effort to make electronic wearables more, well, wearable, a team at the University of Tokyo developed the ink and announced it yesterday. In a single-step process, electrodes and wires can be printed on both surfaces of the textile using the wonder ink. This new super cloth is also way softer and stretchier than today's harder, more rigid wearables and printed electronics.Even when stretched to three times its length, the ink remained highly conducive.\n\nThis new material is somewhat similar to the conducive yarn teased at Google I/O this year, which Levi's is reportedly using to make your jeans a giant touchpad. The goal there is to swipe, pinch, tap, and drag your fingers across these smart threads to answer calls or turn off lights, just like you would on a mousepad or smartphone. (Read about our hands-on with this magic fabric here.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Tokyo researchers' ink, though, seems a lot stretchier and allows manufacturers to make wearables that'll be as skintight as fake tattoos. Yep, that's right. Tech tattoos.\n\nThe future is now.\n\nG/O Media may get a commission 10% off 10% off Wish A gift for literally everybody.\n\nGifts under $20, $10, and even $5.

This ink is very stretchable, and remained highly conductive even when stretched to three times its length. It could also be used to create devices such as a smart touchpad. The researchers are currently working on a technique to print electronics on the fabric using a 3D printer.", "Response B": "Japanese researchers have developed a conductive ink that can be printed on fabrics, making it possible to create flexible electronic devices that are as thin as fake tattoos. The ink is made up of a liquid polymer and a carbon nanotube powder, and can be applied to both the front and back of the fabric, making it suitable for use in the manufacturing of interactive clothing. The material is more flexible than conventional electronic materials, and can be stretched to three times its length without the ink losing its conductivity."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 31}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d470786da637a00014ba26f_64b578f515eec46c11a28ee7", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "1", "style_b": "2", "confidence_a": "3", "confidence_b": "3", "useful_a": "2", "useful_b": "2", "detail_a": "2", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "2", "clarity_b": "2", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "4", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 8m 9s "}}
