{"id": "800", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Conversation:\nJessica: Are you going to the demonstration to help stop the spread of nuclear weapons tomorrow, Cleo?\nBen: No, Simon. I hate demonstrations. I have heard the police will be standing by with tear gas.\nJessica: Yes, but North Korea boasts it has nuclear arms.\nBen: One hundred ninety countries have signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty but the issues are just too complex. There are two sides to every story. I don't understand it and I have no intention of going to a demonstration. Demonstrations don't seem to accomplish anything anyway.\nJessica: Several demonstrations have changed politician's minds throughout history. As a responsible citizen I think it is important to stand up for what you believe in.\nBen: Leave it to someone else. As I said, if you listen to both sides of a story, both sides have some good points. Why should I demonstrate and risk getting hurt for something that I am not even sure is right?\nJessica: You are not likely to get hurt. This will be a peaceful demonstration. I have spoken to the organizer for the university group. He insists that this will be peaceful. He advocates if you want world peace, peace begins at home-and that means right here in this city.\nBen: You go if you want, Simon, but I plan to study for my physics exam.\nJessica: It would only take two hours of your day. The bus leaves the campus at 11:30 and leaves downtown to return to campus at 12:45. You could eat your lunch on the bus.\nBen: I am not going, Simon. Why don't you ask the students in your political science class this afternoon if they want to go?\nJessica: They are all going.\nBen: Okay, Simon. I need to meet my sister for coffee now.\nJessica: Bye then. See you in physics class tomorrow.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "Jessica persuades Ben to join the demonstration against nuclear weapons, but he refuses finally because he thinks it's unnecessary.", "Response B": "Simon and Cleo have different opinions towards the demonstration to help stop the spread of nuclear weapons.
