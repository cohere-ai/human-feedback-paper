First, you\u2019ll need to get some soap base.  You can buy it from a soap store, or you can make it yourself.  Once you have the soap base, you\u2019ll need to mix it with some oils, like vegetable oil or coconut oil.  You can also add some color to the soap, like green or pink.  Once you have the soap base, you\u2019ll need to pour it into a soap mold.  You can buy soap molds from a soap store, or you can make your own soap molds from a variety of materials.  Once you have the soap mold, you\u2019ll need to pour the soap base into it.  You\u2019ll need to wait until the soap base is completely solid, then you can remove it from the soap mold.  Once you have the soap base, you\u2019ll need to cut it into bars, and you can then use it to make soap."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 29}, "label_annotations": {"email": "64063cb9ad66c9a964814b0e_64b563ffb7aeff0442571451", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "It's better if the procedures are listed in numerically, ", "factors_b": "It's better if the steps are listed numerically.
