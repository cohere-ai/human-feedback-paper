{"id": "352", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make raspberry muffins?", "Response A": "Sure, I can help you with that!  You will need the following ingredients:  1 cup of all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 cup melted butter, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.  You will also need a 9-cup baking pan.  First, preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  Then, in a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Then, in a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, eggs, milk, and vanilla extract.  Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.  Pour the batter into the 9-cup baking pan and spread it into an even layer.  Bake the muffins for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.  Let the muffins cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.  Once the muffins are completely cooled, you can store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.  Enjoy!", "Response B": "Sure, I\u2019d be happy to.  I\u2019m not a cook, but I can give you a few tips on how to make muffins.  First, you\u2019ll want to make sure you have all the ingredients ready.  You\u2019ll need flour, eggs, oil, milk, and raspberries.  Then, you\u2019ll want to mix all the ingredients together, and then put them in a muffin pan.  Make sure you put them in the oven at the right temperature, and wait for them to bake.  Once they\u2019re done, you\u2019ll want to take them out of the oven, and enjoy!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 41}, "label_annotations": {"email": "637545d6428d85daeedc3df5_64b5665cc69e32642c5771a9", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "3", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "3", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "2", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "2", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "3", "creativity_a": "3", "creativity_b": "2", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 49s "}}
