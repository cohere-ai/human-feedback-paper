The only way to prevent them is to never get them in the first place, and that\u2019s hard to do, since they\u2019re caused by genetic factors and external factors like shoes and walking.  One way to reduce your chances is to avoid high heels and other shoes that put pressure on your toes.  But if you\u2019re already getting them, the only way to get rid of them is to have surgery.
