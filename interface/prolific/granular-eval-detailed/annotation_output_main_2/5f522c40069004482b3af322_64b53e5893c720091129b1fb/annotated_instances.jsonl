From 1 July 2017, though, the government is exempting purchases of digital currency from Australia's 10 per cent Goods and Services tax. The announcement was made in March of last year, and in 2014 the ATO said small-scale traders \u2014 below $10,000 \u2014 would not be charged GST on their transactions.\n\nGST still applies when exchanging those digital currencies for other goods and services that are themselves subject to the GST, of course. The government confirmed the removal of GST on digital currencies in its innovation and fintech fact sheet.\n\nIn the government's budget measures paper, removing GST on Bitcoin was called out as being useful while not costing the Federal Government any significant revenue: \"Removing double taxation on digital currencies will remove an obstacle for the financial Technology (fintech) sector to grow in Australia. This measure is estimated to have a small but unquantifiable decrease in GST collections and associated payments to the States and Territories over the forward estimates period.\"\n\nStartups aren't happy with the work the government has done, though. CEO of startup advocacy group StartupAUS Alex McCauley: \"There clearly isn't a focus on startups or innovation in this budget. That will certainly cause some frustration, because the Government has done a lot to build expectations that it is committed to making Australia one of the best countries in the world for innovators. It still has a lot of work to do to deliver on that commitment.\n\nFrom the budget's fintech fact sheet:\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The government is removing double taxation on digital currencies and supporting the development of the payments industry through the Australian Payment Clearing Association. The government is also encouraging the use of bitcoin and other digital currencies by removing the double taxation on digital currencies.\n\nDigital currencies are not a legal tender in Australia. However, the government recognises their potential benefits in terms of innovation in the financial technology sector.\n\nTo remove double taxation on digital currencies, the government is amending the GST law to clarify that digital currency is a payment system and not a financial product. This means that GST will not apply to the acquisition of digital currency.\n\nThe government also recognises the importance of digital payments to the Australian economy. The government is working with industry to develop a vision and strategy for digital payments in Australia.\n\nThe Australian Payment Clearing Association (APCA) is undertaking a major project to develop a new system to enable faster payments. The government is providing $7.4 million in 2016-17 to support this project.\n\nThe Government is also supporting the development of new payment methods and technologies through the Australian Payments Council.\n\nTo encourage the use of bitcoin and other digital currencies, the government is removing the double taxation on digital currency. This will provide greater certainty for businesses and individuals who use digital currencies and will reduce compliance costs.\n\nThe government is also removing the double taxation on digital currency by amending the GST law to clarify that digital currency is a payment system and not a financial product.
