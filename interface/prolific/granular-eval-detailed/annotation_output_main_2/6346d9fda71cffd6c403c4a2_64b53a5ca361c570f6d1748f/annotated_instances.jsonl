A multi-shielded design (two 95% copper braids and 100% aluminum Mylar foil) provide optimum isolation from EMI and RFI interference for enhanced picture clarity. A nitrogen-injected foam dielectric maintains 75 Ohm impedance for optimum video signal transfer while the solid 99.97% pure, silver-coated, oxygen-free, copper center conductor provides exceptional signal transfer for accurate video reproduction. 3' length.\r\nProduct features:\r\n*24K gold plating\r\n*Precision machined 8 segment connectors\r\n*Nitrogen injected dielectric\r\n*Multi-shielded design\r\n*Pure silver coated oxygen-free copper", "Response B": "This Acoustic Research (AR) video component cable is of higher quality than most standard audio/video cables giving you a cleaner, clearer picture and sound. The three-piece set of red, blue, and green cables are each 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) long.  The multi-shielded design, nitrogen injected dielectric, and pure silver coated oxygen-free copper all work together to provide an improved signal transmission.  The 24K gold plating on the precision machined 8 segment connectors ensures long-lasting, corrosion-free connections.  The male end of the cables are standard RCA connectors."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "amazon", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 42}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6346d9fda71cffd6c403c4a2_64b53a5ca361c570f6d1748f", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "3", "confidence_a": "4", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "3", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "3", "creativity_b": "4", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 7m 25s "}}
