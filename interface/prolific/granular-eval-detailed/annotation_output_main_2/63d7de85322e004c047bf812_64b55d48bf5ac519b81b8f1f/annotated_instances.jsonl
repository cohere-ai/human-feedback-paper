The current assets under management of the biggest incumbent in the market today BlackRock is less than this. Of course, BlackRock, for example, is also a huge beneficiary of the growth is passive investing brought about both directly and indirectly through robo advice. In addition, the firm has a chunky stake in one of the UK market leaders Scalable Capital.\n\nWhile this all sounds very bullish for robo-advice, the report notes that total levels of assets managed by traditional players is likely to remain high as a percentage of total assets. Nonetheless, it says a broader process of 'digitisation' is occurring within the wealth management space.\n\n\"Digital transformation of the wealth management industry is not a pure technological challenge. As the likelihood of returning to pre-crisis revenue margins is remote, wealth managers need to reinvent their business model to adapt to existing clients' changing needs and to capture new clients while reducing operating expenses on a relative basis\" the report noted.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "- Robo-advisers could take over from traditional firms such as BlackRock, according to a new report by Deloitte.\n- It forecasts that the 2020 market size of robo-advisors will be $2.2tn, growing to $16bn by 2025.\n- However, the report also suggests that total levels of assets managed by traditional players will remain high.", "Response B": "Overall, the report makes the point that wealth managers need to embrace technology to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and better serve their clients. It also notes that clients are becoming increasingly demanding, and expect instant service, access to information, and personalized advice. While it does not suggest that robo-advice platforms will replace incumbents in the near future, it does suggest that the market will continue to grow rapidly and that incumbents should be proactive in ensuring they have the right digital strategy."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 34}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d7de85322e004c047bf812_64b55d48bf5ac519b81b8f1f", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "3", "confidence_a": "3", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "2", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "3", "creativity_a": "2", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "No.", "factors_b": "No."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 37s "}}
