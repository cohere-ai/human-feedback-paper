First, you can model good behavior yourself, and make healthy eating a family affair.  You can also try to make healthy eating fun, by offering kids a variety of healthy options and letting them choose what they want.  You can also try to set a good example for kids by eating healthy yourself, and by not eating unhealthy foods in front of them.  Finally, you can try to educate kids about the benefits of healthy eating, and try to get them to understand that healthy eating is important for their health."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 42}, "label_annotations": {"email": "55885582fdf99b4021921fbd_64b57b60dcb2ae53bca481c6", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "2", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "3", "creativity_b": "4", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "feels more like a list of things to do, rather than how to encourage.", "factors_b": "I prefer this conversational, more personal style of answer"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 13m 58s "}}
