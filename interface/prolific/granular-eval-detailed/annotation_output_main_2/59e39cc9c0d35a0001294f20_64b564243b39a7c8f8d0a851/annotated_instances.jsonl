{"id": "379", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Dive Brief:\n\nA K-12 chief information officer's time used to be spent primarily on IT tasks, but amid ed tech's increasing prevalence and a push for data-driven decision-making, CIOs have had to adapt and spend more time helping educators and administrators track and assess data.\n\nDistrict Administration reports CIOs serve as data interpreters and visionaries, facilitating understanding between technology departments and academic/operational branches of their districts and developing a long-term plan about where data fits into the district's strategic goals.\n\nCIOs also fulfill a training role, helping educators without data backgrounds gain insights from analytics, and they break down silos by connecting people from various departments with data to meet continuous improvement goals.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThere is much talk about how schools haven't changed at all in centuries, but the fact is school and district leaders have had a lot to adapt to in recent years. The digital age has brought a range of new technologies into schools, and that has provided new opportunities for data collection and analysis. Schools are behind other sectors in embracing this potential, however.\n\nA recent report from public policy think tank the Center for Data Innovation urged federal and state policymakers to incentivize faster adoption in schools and districts. Beyond encouraging administrators to use data to improve their operations and instructional practices, the Center for Data Innovation wants schools to get data into the hands of students and parents, giving them more agency over the learning process.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "K-12 schools are under increasing pressure to embrace data-driven decision-making, and the head of one of the nation's largest school districts is trying to do just that. The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) recently appointed chief information officer Fitna Ashgar as chief academic officer, which means that she will now focus more on helping educators collect and analyse data. \"This is a school that is going to be led by data,\" said Ashgar. \"This is a school that is going to be led by the academic mission, and we are going to be led by data.\" The move is part of a wider effort to modernise the school. As part of a five-year plan to improve the quality of LAUSD's instruction, the district is in the process of implementing a series of new technologies in classrooms. Among the technologies are mobile devices for teachers, tablets for students, and the implementation of a cloud-based learning management system. The district is also investing in professional development for teachers, providing them with support to help them integrate these technologies into their lessons.", "Response B": "The role of CIO in US schools and colleges has changed dramatically with the rise of edtech, according to Elizabeth Dabney, director of research and policy analysis at the Data Quality Campaign. Schools across the country have adopted digital methods of data collection and analysis, from students to state, with CIOs seen as \"data visionaries\", providing the crucial link between the academic and technology department."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 25}, "label_annotations": {"email": "59e39cc9c0d35a0001294f20_64b564243b39a7c8f8d0a851", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "3", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "3", "confidence_b": "3", "useful_a": "3", "useful_b": "3", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "3", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "Yes", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 10m 42s "}}
