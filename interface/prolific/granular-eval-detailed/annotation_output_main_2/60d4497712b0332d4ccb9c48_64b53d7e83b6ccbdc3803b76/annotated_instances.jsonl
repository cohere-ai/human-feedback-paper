{"id": "79", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make 'melt and pour' soap?", "Response A": "Buy a melt and pour soap base.\nCut the soap base into 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) chunks with a clean, sharp knife.\nMelt the soap base in the microwave.\nAllow the soap base to cool to 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C).\nStir in soap making dye or pigment powder, if desired.\nStir in some fragrance oils or essential oils, if desired.\nPour the soap into your desired soap making molds.\nGently tap the mold.\nAllow the soap base to cool for 12 to 24 hours.\nRelease the soap from the mold.\nAllow the soap to finish drying, if needed.\nCreate texture with dried herbs or flowers.\nUse spices for fragrance, texture, and color.\nUse butters for extra moisture.\n\nCocoa and shea butter are both great for adding a creamy lather to the soap.\nAdd some extracts for additional benefits.\nMake you soap more exfoliating with additions such as ground oatmeal.\nAdd a rubber soap making stamp into a plain mold before pouring the soap.\nAdd a surprise into clear, glycerin soap.\nStir two different colors together to make swirled soap.\nPour differently-colored bases at different times to create layers.", "Response B": "Sure.  It\u2019s a pretty simple process, but you should read through the following instructions carefully to make sure you do it right.  First, you\u2019ll need to measure out the amount of soap base you\u2019ll need for the quantity of soap you want to make.  You\u2019ll want to make sure you have enough soap base to fill the molds you\u2019ll use, plus a little extra to account for any spillage or mistakes.  You\u2019ll also want to make sure you have enough soap to make the amount of soap you want.  You can use either a kitchen scale or a digital scale to make sure you get the right amount.  Make sure you\u2019re using the right kind of soap base, too.  You want to use a clear, white soap base that\u2019s labeled as \u2018melt and pour\u2019, and you want to make sure it\u2019s the right consistency.  You\u2019ll want to make sure it\u2019s not too hard, but also not too soft.  You want it to be easy to pour, but not so"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 29}, "label_annotations": {"email": "60d4497712b0332d4ccb9c48_64b53d7e83b6ccbdc3803b76", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "3", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "3", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "2", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "1", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "3", "creativity_b": "1", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 6m 57s "}}
