First, you\u2019ll need to melt some soap base.  You can find soap base at most craft stores.  Then you\u2019ll want to pour the soap base into a mold.  You can find soap molds at most craft stores as well.  Then you\u2019ll want to wait until the soap has cooled completely, and then you\u2019ll want to remove the soap from the mold.  You can then use it as a bar of soap."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 29}, "label_annotations": {"email": "644bcf6d13e9bc2ac17b796c_64b564e5671b40d5c3f9802c", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "3", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "2", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "1", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 50s "}}
