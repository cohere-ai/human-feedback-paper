{"id": "274", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to write an etsy review?", "Response A": "Sure, you can just type in a few words or phrases about the product you bought, or about the service you received.  You can also include a photo of the item if you\u2019d like.  You can also write a longer review if you\u2019d like, but it\u2019s not required.  I recommend you include some information about the product you bought, and also about the service you received.  You can also write about the quality of the product, and whether or not you\u2019d recommend it to others.  You can also write about the customer service you received, whether it was helpful or not.  You can also write about the overall experience you had with the shop, whether it was good or bad.", "Response B": "Sure, let\u2019s talk about that. Etsy is a website for buying and selling handmade goods, and as part of its platform, it allows buyers to leave reviews about their experiences with individual sellers. These reviews are important, because they help both buyers and sellers. Buyers can use reviews to learn more about a seller and decide whether they want to buy from them, and sellers can use reviews to improve their products and their customer service. Reviews are written in a specific format, like this:\n\n\u201cThis was my first purchase from this seller, and I\u2019m very happy with it! The earrings arrived quickly and were beautifully packaged, and they are even more lovely in person than in the pictures. They are a perfect gift, and I can\u2019t wait to give them to my friend! I would definitely buy from this seller again.\u201d"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 36}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5a2ea69555ff700001ab7c81_64b56e29e3082581e4e174e7", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "3", "confidence_a": "3", "confidence_b": "3", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "3", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "2", "creativity_a": "3", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "Yes", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "Yes", "repetition_b": "Yes", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 55s "}}
