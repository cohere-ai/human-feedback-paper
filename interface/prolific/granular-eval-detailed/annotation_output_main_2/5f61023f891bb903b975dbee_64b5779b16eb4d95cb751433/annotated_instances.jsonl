I'll return them tomorrow.\nElizabeth: Sorry, but I usually go to the cafeteria and review them.

You haven't missed any classes.\nMichael: To be honest, I work in supermarket from 7 to 10 o'clock every evening.\nElizabeth: I see. So you're pretty tired when you come to class.\nMichael: That's exactly why I want to borrow your notes. My notes aren't very good.\nElizabeth: So what do you usually do in class?\nMichael: I'm always awake at the beginning, but thirty minutes after class begins I feel sleepy and have trouble keeping my eyes open.\nElizabeth: Well, I need someone to study with and you need someone to keep you awake. Can we be study partners?\nMichael: Oh sure. That's a good idea. So give me a push when you see me sleeping in class.\nElizabeth: OK. Let's start today in the library. We are going there anyway and I don't have to go to the cafeteria.\nMichael: Sounds good.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "Michael is having trouble keeping up with his history class due to his job at the supermarket.
