Start with some basic scales and exercises, to get your fingers moving and your brain thinking about the instrument.\n\n2. Play through some familiar songs, to get used to playing in a band setting.\n\n3. Play along with a metronome, to help you keep time and improve your technique.\n\n4. Play through some bass lines, to get used to playing in a solo setting.\n\n5. Play along with a drum machine, to help you practice your timing and coordination."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 43}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to warm up on bass guitar?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Begin with chromatics at a tempo of 120 BPM (or 60 BPM if you're just starting out), one note per beat.<br/>After the chromatics, do whole-steps on each string, four notes per string, one finger per note per string, to help with the stretching and warming up.<br/>Go to the 12th fret of your highest pitched string and begin doing 8 full bends with each finger on that string, alternating after every four.<br/>Begin playing scales, in one key, at 120 (or 60) beats per minute, one note per beat.<br/>Begin playing different scales in one key and different positions at 120 BPM without skipping a beat.<br/>Take a scale you know all modes of, and choose a key.<br/>Find the fastest tempo you can play in time and chose and scale and play every mode of it.</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response B </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure, here are some tips:<br/><br/>1.
