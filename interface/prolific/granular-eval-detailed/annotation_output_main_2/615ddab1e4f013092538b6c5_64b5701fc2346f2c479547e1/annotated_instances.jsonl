{"id": "254", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to warm up on bass guitar?", "Response A": "Begin with chromatics at a tempo of 120 BPM (or 60 BPM if you're just starting out), one note per beat.\nAfter the chromatics, do whole-steps on each string, four notes per string, one finger per note per string, to help with the stretching and warming up.\nGo to the 12th fret of your highest pitched string and begin doing 8 full bends with each finger on that string, alternating after every four.\nBegin playing scales, in one key, at 120 (or 60) beats per minute, one note per beat.\nBegin playing different scales in one key and different positions at 120 BPM without skipping a beat.\nTake a scale you know all modes of, and choose a key.\nFind the fastest tempo you can play in time and chose and scale and play every mode of it.", "Response B": "Sure, here are some tips:\n\n1. Start with some basic scales and exercises, to get your fingers moving and your brain thinking about the instrument.\n\n2. Play through some familiar songs, to get used to playing in a band setting.\n\n3. Play along with a metronome, to help you keep time and improve your technique.\n\n4. Play through some bass lines, to get used to playing in a solo setting.\n\n5. Play along with a drum machine, to help you practice your timing and coordination."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 43}, "label_annotations": {"email": "615ddab1e4f013092538b6c5_64b5701fc2346f2c479547e1", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "4", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "A provides an answer that is more fundamental and focuses on guitar coordination warm up", "factors_b": "B suggested warm up is for a seasoned guitar player", "feedback": "Both are acceptable responses depending on the desire and experience of the  guitar player, which was not identified in the prompt"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 6s "}}
