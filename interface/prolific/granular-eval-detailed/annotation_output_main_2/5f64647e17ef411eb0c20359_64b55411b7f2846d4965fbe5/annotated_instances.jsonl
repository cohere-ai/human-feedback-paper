The region hit double-digit growth for five quarters in a row between Q1 2015 and Q1 2016, and posted organic growth higher than 5% for the following four quarters after that until today's report.\n\nHowever, EMEA remains DAN's best-performing region in terms of organic gross profit growth, as Q2 declines were worse in Asia-Pacific (down 3.8%) and the Americas (down 4.1%).\n\nAnalysts at Liberum reported that Dentsu has lowered its projection of full-year net sales by 1.5% on the back of weaker spending commitments by FMCG companies at the start of the year.\n\n\"We believe that the weakness in the consumer packaged good companies' spend is cyclical and point to comments from the big FMCG companies that suggest a rise in marketing spend in H2,\" Liberum told investors.\n\nIn June, DAN's global chief executive Jerry Buhlmann told Campaign \"the direction of travel is down\" as the network downgraded its growth forecast for the global ad market to 3.8% this year compared to 4.8% in 2016.\n\nBuhlmann also warned about a \"slowdown\" in digital advertising in the wake of the brand safety row earlier this year involving YouTube and other online platforms.\n\nDentsu Aegis Network's clients include Adidas, Burberry, Diageo and General Motors.\n\nToshihiro Yamamoto, president and chief executive of Dentsu, said of today's disclosure: \"Going into the second half of the year, despite uncertain market conditions, the group is well placed to realise the positive impact of strong new business wins in the first half of 2017.\"\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Dentsu\u2019s organic gross profit growth declined by 2.7% in the second quarter of 2017, according to its latest results.", "Response B": "Dentsu Aegis Network's (DAN) organic gross profit growth for the second quarter of 2017 declined across all regions year-on-year, with the exception of EMEA.
