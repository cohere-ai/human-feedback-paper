{"id": "808", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Given the document below, determine if the summary is factually consistent with the document. \nDocument: The boss of pizza giant Domino's has admitted the company failed to get the balance right when it upped delivery prices to counter inflation after the business reported first-half profits dropped by more than 20 per cent.\n\nThe company said its plans to fight inflation \"had not been optimal\" in the first half, with decisions to increase product prices and delivery and surcharge fees impacting how often customers ordered, particularly in overseas markets such as Japan and Germany.\n\n\"We haven't always had the balance right for some customer groups\": Domino's Pizza CEO Don Meij.\n\n\"First and foremost, we actually got delivery pricing wrong, not carry-out pricing,\" chief executive Don Meij said.\n\nHe said while shoppers had increasingly returned in-store to pick up their takeaway orders, price increases for delivery had hurt how often customers ordered pizza.\nSummary: Shares in the pizza company have declined precipitously after a sharp drop in profit, with Don Meij, the CEO, admitting the company \"did not get the balance right\" after upping prices.\nIs the summary consistent with the document? First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "The document contains the statement \"We haven't always had the balance right for some customer groups\", which indicates that the company has changed its pricing strategy and has seen a decline in profits as a result. The summary is therefore consistent with the document.\nYes", "Response B": "The summary is generally consistent with the provided document, though there are a few minor inaccuracies and omissions. The main points covered in the summary are accurately represented, with the main omissions being the details on the specific reasons for the profit drop and the timing of these events. There is also a slight inaccuracy in the reason for the profit drop, with the summary focusing on delivery pricing as the main issue while the document indicates that the delivery pricing changes were a major contributing factor but were not the only factor. Overall though the summary is generally accurate and provides a reasonable overview of the main points of the document. \n\nI would evaluate the overall accuracy of the summary as \"Yes\" with some minor inaccuracies and omissions."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "factualnlg", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 41}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6272f5f3d37c1c9e88c115a2_64b53c0af3ba2103e5a64f79", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "4", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "3", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "3", "creativity_b": "4", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "A doesn't provide much detail or nuance", "factors_b": "B was a comprehensive, nuanced response", "feedback": "Thank you"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 9m 16s "}}
