{"id": "902", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make 'melt and pour' soap?", "Response A": "Sure, here\u2019s how you can make a bar of soap with a melt and pour process.  First, you\u2019ll need to melt some soap base.  You can find soap base at most craft stores.  Then you\u2019ll want to pour the soap base into a mold.  You can find soap molds at most craft stores as well.  Then you\u2019ll want to wait until the soap has cooled completely, and then you\u2019ll want to remove the soap from the mold.  You can then use it as a bar of soap.", "Response B": "Sure.  It\u2019s a pretty simple process, but you should read through the following instructions carefully to make sure you do it right.  First, you\u2019ll need to measure out the amount of soap base you\u2019ll need for the quantity of soap you want to make.  You\u2019ll want to make sure you have enough soap base to fill the molds you\u2019ll use, plus a little extra to account for any spillage or mistakes.  You\u2019ll also want to make sure you have enough soap to make the amount of soap you want.  You can use either a kitchen scale or a digital scale to make sure you get the right amount.  Make sure you\u2019re using the right kind of soap base, too.  You want to use a clear, white soap base that\u2019s labeled as \u2018melt and pour\u2019, and you want to make sure it\u2019s the right consistency.  You\u2019ll want to make sure it\u2019s not too hard, but also not too soft.  You want it to be easy to pour, but not so"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 29}, "label_annotations": {"email": "640103805957bbf6a1326ed0_64b5321ebff08f985ec9eb21", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "4", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "Response A gives a good guide on how to create a soap bar with the correct method but lacks as much detail as B.", "factors_b": "B is a bit better than A as it is more detailed.", "feedback": "Both are good response but B is slightly more detailed and would be better for a novice."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 12s "}}
