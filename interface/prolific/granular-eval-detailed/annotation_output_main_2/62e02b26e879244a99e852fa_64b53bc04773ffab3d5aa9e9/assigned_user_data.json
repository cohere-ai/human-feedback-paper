This high-end cable is designed to deliver the best possible picture and sound quality. The PR190N is a high-performance component video cable designed for use with HD TVs. It features a pure silver-coated oxygen-free copper core, which provides high signal clarity and resistance to signal interference. The cable is also multi-shielded, which protects the signal from interference. The PR190N comes with precision machined 8- segment connectors, which make it easy to connect to your TV.", "Response B": "This Acoustic Research (AR) video component cable is of higher quality than most standard audio/video cables giving you a cleaner, clearer picture and sound. The three-piece set of red, blue, and green cables are each 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) long.  The multi-shielded design, nitrogen injected dielectric, and pure silver coated oxygen-free copper all work together to provide an improved signal transmission.  The 24K gold plating on the precision machined 8 segment connectors ensures long-lasting, corrosion-free connections.  The male end of the cables are standard RCA connectors."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "amazon", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 42}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Your client has asked you to write a product description using product features and product title below.
