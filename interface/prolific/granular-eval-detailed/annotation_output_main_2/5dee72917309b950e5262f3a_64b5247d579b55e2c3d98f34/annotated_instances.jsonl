Gather your ingredients: soap base, distilled water, essential oils, and colorants (optional). 2. Chop the soap base into small pieces and place it in a microwave-safe bowl. 3. Microwave the soap for 30 seconds at a time, stirring often until it is completely melted. 4. Add a few drops of essential oils and colorants if desired. 5. Pour the mixture into a mold and let it cool completely. 6. Once it has hardened, remove the soap from the mold and enjoy!", "Response B": "Sure, here\u2019s how you can make a bar of soap with a melt and pour process.  First, you\u2019ll need to melt some soap base.  You can find soap base at most craft stores.  Then you\u2019ll want to pour the soap base into a mold.  You can find soap molds at most craft stores as well.  Then you\u2019ll want to wait until the soap has cooled completely, and then you\u2019ll want to remove the soap from the mold.  You can then use it as a bar of soap."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 29}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5dee72917309b950e5262f3a_64b5247d579b55e2c3d98f34", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "3", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 23s "}}
