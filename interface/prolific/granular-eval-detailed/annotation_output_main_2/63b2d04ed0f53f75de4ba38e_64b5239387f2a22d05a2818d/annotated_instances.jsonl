{"id": "990", "input_text": {"Prompt": "The current focus on improving Medicare physician payment through a variety of Alternative Payment Models (APMs) is widely perceived as a major shift away from fee-for-service, therefore reducing the importance of improving Medicare's Physician Fee Schedule (PFS). But even if APMs eventually replace the PFS as the dominant payment methods, key aspects of the fee schedule (or an equivalent tool) will remain important and deserve attention. Not only does the PFS continue to govern nearly $90 billion in Medicare payments annually, it also serves as the basis for, among other things, setting payment rates, making real-time payments to providers, and calculating shared savings.\n\nOn Tuesday, September 26, the Urban Institute, the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy, and the Actuarial Research Corporation hosted a one-day conference on the evolution and state of the PFS and to consider the movement to new payment models. The conference included four sessions and a brief lunchtime address, and feature experts involved in designing and implementing the PFS 25 years ago, those currently working on improvements to the PFS, and those working to design and implement new APMs and other innovations.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The following conference summary summarizes the key points made during the four sessions and lunch.

Gordon, M.D., Founding Executive Director, Center for Mind-Body Medicine\nPanelists:\nJeffrey H. Hertz, M.D., J.D., Partner, Arnold & Porter\nRobert E. Moffit, Ph.D., Senior Fellow and Director, Center for Health Policy Studies, The Heritage Foundation\nJames C. Capretta, Ph.D., Resident Fellow, American Enterprise Institute\nPeter J. Cunningham, Ph.D., Director, Center for Studying Health System Change\n\nThe first panel of the day focused on the history of the PFS, how it has evolved, and how it relates to broader health care payment policy trends.\n\nJames S. Gordon, M.D., Founding Executive Director of the Center for Mind-Body Medicine, opened the discussion by emphasizing the importance of a \"holistic approach\" to health care payment policy. He argued that the current focus on improving Medicare physician payment through a variety of APMs is necessary, but also stressed the importance of recognizing the broader context of health care delivery.\n\nThomas Reilly, M.D., Health Care Policy Analyst at the Urban Institute, provided an overview of the history and evolution of the PFS. He noted that the PFS has undergone significant changes since it was first implemented in 1992. Many of the changes have been driven by concerns about the rate of growth in Medicare spending and the desire to control costs. Reilly emphasized that the PFS is not a fixed program; it is constantly evolving.\n\nJeffrey Hertz, M.D., J.D., Partner at Arnold & Porter, discussed the relationship between the PFS and other payment models. He explained that the PFS is the foundation for many other payment models, such as bundled payments and accountable care organizations. While the PFS is not a panacea, it remains important for the health care system as a whole.\n\nRobert E.
