The current assets under management of the biggest incumbent in the market today BlackRock is less than this. Of course, BlackRock, for example, is also a huge beneficiary of the growth is passive investing brought about both directly and indirectly through robo advice. In addition, the firm has a chunky stake in one of the UK market leaders Scalable Capital.\n\nWhile this all sounds very bullish for robo-advice, the report notes that total levels of assets managed by traditional players is likely to remain high as a percentage of total assets. Nonetheless, it says a broader process of 'digitisation' is occurring within the wealth management space.\n\n\"Digital transformation of the wealth management industry is not a pure technological challenge. As the likelihood of returning to pre-crisis revenue margins is remote, wealth managers need to reinvent their business model to adapt to existing clients' changing needs and to capture new clients while reducing operating expenses on a relative basis\" the report noted.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "An explosive market for disruptive wealth management could see assets under management surpass those of the world's largest asset manager by 2025.\n\nThe market, compiled by Deloitte, forecasts a 2020 size of $2.2tn for robo-advice platforms and digital wealth managers, growing to $16tn by 2025.\n\nThe current assets under management of the largest incumbent, BlackRock, is less than this total.

Investors' preference for passive investing is behind an increase in flows towards the platforms. The desire of wealth managers to digitise their offerings in the face of squeezed profit margins is also driving the growth of robo-advice."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 34}, "label_annotations": {"email": "64063cb9ad66c9a964814b0e_64b55be3525e425ef4c2df21", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "2", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "2", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "2", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "2", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "2", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "1", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 49s "}}
