The channel has suffered mass layoffs, and is seeking new ways to bring in revenue.\n\nWhile it's still focused on its traditional core market in North America, ESPN has been branching out to get its content in in front of consumers in other countries.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "ESPN and Tencent have announced a deal to cover sports games in China, with Mandarin-language commentary.
