{"id": "785", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to overcome a midlife crisis?", "Response A": "Sure, I\u2019ll tell you what I know about this.  A midlife crisis is a period of intense emotional distress that\u2019s often triggered by major life changes, such as becoming an empty-nester, or a divorce.  You may feel like you\u2019re facing some sort of \u201c squirrels\u201d problem, where you\u2019re trying to find a new way of living, but you\u2019re not sure how to do it.  You may also feel like you\u2019re missing out on something, like the opportunity to be young again, or to have more time.  You may be experiencing an \u201cin-between\u201d feeling, where you\u2019re not sure what to do with your life, or where to turn.  This can be a very difficult time for people, and it can be hard to know where to turn.", "Response B": "A midlife crisis is a period of emotional stress that occurs when a person realizes that their life is half over.  Some people cope with this by making major changes to their lives, such as changing jobs, changing relationships, or changing their appearance.  Other people cope with this by trying to accept the fact that their lives are half over, and that they will never be as young as they once were.  There is no one right way to cope with a midlife crisis, but there are some strategies that can help.  One strategy is to try to find ways to feel younger, such as by taking care of your health, or by spending time with young people.  Another strategy is to try to find ways to feel more fulfilled, such as by finding a new hobby, or by volunteering for a cause you believe in.  Finally, some people find that talking to a therapist can help them work through their midlife crisis."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 39}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5ee3be6ff942c407cd54e6ce_64b53e386311779db35aa9cf", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "2", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "2", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "1", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "3", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "2", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "Yes", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "Yes", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "I based my responses on Option A as it made me feel bad about myself, even though what was written was correct.", "factors_b": "Option B has positive, helpful information so I used this to help base my scores on"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 8m 46s "}}
