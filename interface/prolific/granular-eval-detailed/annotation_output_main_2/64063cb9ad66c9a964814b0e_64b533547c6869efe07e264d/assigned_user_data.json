Cunningham, Ph.D., Director, Center for Studying Health System Change\n\nThe first panel of the day focused on the history of the PFS, how it has evolved, and how it relates to broader health care payment policy trends.\n\nJames S. Gordon, M.D., Founding Executive Director of the Center for Mind-Body Medicine, opened the discussion by emphasizing the importance of a \"holistic approach\" to health care payment policy. He argued that the current focus on improving Medicare physician payment through a variety of APMs is necessary, but also stressed the importance of recognizing the broader context of health care delivery.\n\nThomas Reilly, M.D., Health Care Policy Analyst at the Urban Institute, provided an overview of the history and evolution of the PFS. He noted that the PFS has undergone significant changes since it was first implemented in 1992. Many of the changes have been driven by concerns about the rate of growth in Medicare spending and the desire to control costs. Reilly emphasized that the PFS is not a fixed program; it is constantly evolving.\n\nJeffrey Hertz, M.D., J.D., Partner at Arnold & Porter, discussed the relationship between the PFS and other payment models. He explained that the PFS is the foundation for many other payment models, such as bundled payments and accountable care organizations.
