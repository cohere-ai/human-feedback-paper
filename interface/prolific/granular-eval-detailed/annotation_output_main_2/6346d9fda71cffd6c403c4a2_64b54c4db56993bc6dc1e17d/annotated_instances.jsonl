You will need the following ingredients:  1 cup of all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 cup melted butter, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.  You will also need a 9-cup baking pan.  First, preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  Then, in a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Then, in a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, eggs, milk, and vanilla extract.  Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.  Pour the batter into the 9-cup baking pan and spread it into an even layer.  Bake the muffins for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.  Let the muffins cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.  Once the muffins are completely cooled, you can store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.  Enjoy!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 41}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6346d9fda71cffd6c403c4a2_64b54c4db56993bc6dc1e17d", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "4", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 7m 36s "}}
