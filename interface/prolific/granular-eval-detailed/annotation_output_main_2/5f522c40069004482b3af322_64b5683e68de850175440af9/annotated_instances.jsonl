Can I help you?\nJack: Professor Turner, are you giving your Advanced Geology course again next semester?\nFrida: Yes.\nJack: I wonder if I could enroll in it, I know it's a graduate course and I'm only a junior, but...\nFrida: Aren't you a bit young? I've allowed qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time to keep up.\nJack: I know, but the geology of the American West is my favorite interest and I've read a lot in the field. Last semester I took Professor Burman's course and I didn't find it challenging enough.\nFrida: I see. You certainly aren't one of those students who are out for easy grades.\nJack: I should say not. I really want to learn something.\nFrida: Well, I'll speak to Professor Burman, if he thinks you're ready, I'll let you enroll.\nJack: Oh, thanks. Prof. Turner, that's very nice of you.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "In this conversation, Jack, a junior student, asks Professor Turner if she will be teaching her Advanced Geology course again next semester. She confirms that she will be, and he then asks if he can enroll in the course, even though he is only a junior.
