From 1 July 2017, though, the government is exempting purchases of digital currency from Australia's 10 per cent Goods and Services tax. The announcement was made in March of last year, and in 2014 the ATO said small-scale traders \u2014 below $10,000 \u2014 would not be charged GST on their transactions.\n\nGST still applies when exchanging those digital currencies for other goods and services that are themselves subject to the GST, of course. The government confirmed the removal of GST on digital currencies in its innovation and fintech fact sheet.\n\nIn the government's budget measures paper, removing GST on Bitcoin was called out as being useful while not costing the Federal Government any significant revenue: \"Removing double taxation on digital currencies will remove an obstacle for the financial Technology (fintech) sector to grow in Australia. This measure is estimated to have a small but unquantifiable decrease in GST collections and associated payments to the States and Territories over the forward estimates period.\"\n\nStartups aren't happy with the work the government has done, though. CEO of startup advocacy group StartupAUS Alex McCauley: \"There clearly isn't a focus on startups or innovation in this budget. That will certainly cause some frustration, because the Government has done a lot to build expectations that it is committed to making Australia one of the best countries in the world for innovators. It still has a lot of work to do to deliver on that commitment.\n\nFrom the budget's fintech fact sheet:\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Desperation for a new water supply due to droughts in California has lead the San Luis Obispo Counter Supervisors to approach the PG&E's Diablo Canyon Power Plant.  The company can produce nearly a million gallons of water a day but this has only been available for internal use so far.  The plan is to buy 60% of this hopefully non-contaminated water from PG&E, which is critically needed in the short term.  It is not clear how much this will cost residents and businesses in the region.", "Response B": "The Australian government's 2017 federal budget will remove the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from digital currency purchases, so bitcoin and other digital currencies will be treated as if they were dollars. From 1 July, digital currency purchases will no longer be eligible for the 10% GST and this change should help the digital fintech sector grow further in Australia. The tax still applies when exchanging digital currencies for goods and services."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": "distractor_26"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "62d2c9d825a0449c13aa42cc_64b52f9a7b35372d0bee665c", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "3", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "3", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "1", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "3", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "3", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 34s "}}
