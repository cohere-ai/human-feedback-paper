First, you can model good behavior yourself, and make healthy eating a family affair.  You can also try to make healthy eating fun, by offering kids a variety of healthy options and letting them choose what they want.  You can also try to set a good example for kids by eating healthy yourself, and by not eating unhealthy foods in front of them.
