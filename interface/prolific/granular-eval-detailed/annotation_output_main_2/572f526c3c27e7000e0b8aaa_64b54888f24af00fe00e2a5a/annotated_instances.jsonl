Driscoll, the assistant director-in-charge of the FBI's New York field office said Watson \"repeatedly attempted to entice both investors and lenders through a series of deliberate deceptions and fabrications.\"\n\nAuthorities say Watson and his business partners, between 2018 and 2021, attempted to defraud investors and lenders of \"tens of millions of dollars through fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions\" about the company's debts and other key financial information.\n\nOn multiple occasions, the U.S. attorney's office said, Watson and his colleagues pretended to be other media executives to cover up earlier misrepresentations.\nSummary: The founder of the troubled digital start-up Ozy Media has been arrested on fraud charges as part of a scheme to prop up the financially struggling company.\nIs the summary consistent with the document? First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "Yes, the summary is consistent with the document. The article reports that the founder of the troubled digital start-up Ozy Media was arrested on fraud charges as part of a scheme to prop up the financially struggling company. It mentions that the arrest came after the guilty pleas of Ozy's top executives, including the company's then-chief operating officer, who allegedly impersonated a YouTube executive during a pitch to Goldman Sachs, a potential investor. The indictment accuses Watson of conspiring to commit securities fraud and wire fraud, as well as identity theft for his role in the impersonation. The article also mentions that the scrutiny over the company deepened after the New York Times reported about an Ozy official masquerading as a YouTube executive in a failing attempt to get Goldman Sachs to infuse money into the struggling enterprise. Shortly after, Ozy said it was shutting down. The article reports that authorities say Watson and his business partners, between 2018 and 2021, attempted to defraud investors and lenders of \"tens of millions of dollars through fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions\" about the company's debts and other key financial information. On multiple occasions, the U.S. attorney's office says, Watson and his colleagues pretended to be other media executives to cover up earlier misrepresentations. Thus, the summary is factually consistent with the document.", "Response B": "The summary is mostly consistent with the document, but it should be noted that the document does not state that the founder was arrested as part of a scheme to prop up the company.
