You can buy it from a soap store, or you can make it yourself.  Once you have the soap base, you\u2019ll need to mix it with some oils, like vegetable oil or coconut oil.  You can also add some color to the soap, like green or pink.  Once you have the soap base, you\u2019ll need to pour it into a soap mold.  You can buy soap molds from a soap store, or you can make your own soap molds from a variety of materials.  Once you have the soap mold, you\u2019ll need to pour the soap base into it.  You\u2019ll need to wait until the soap base is completely solid, then you can remove it from the soap mold.  Once you have the soap base, you\u2019ll need to cut it into bars, and you can then use it to make soap.", "Response B": "To make'melt and pour' soap, you will need to follow these steps: 1. Gather your ingredients: soap base, distilled water, essential oils, and colorants (optional). 2. Chop the soap base into small pieces and place it in a microwave-safe bowl. 3. Microwave the soap for 30 seconds at a time, stirring often until it is completely melted. 4. Add a few drops of essential oils and colorants if desired. 5. Pour the mixture into a mold and let it cool completely. 6. Once it has hardened, remove the soap from the mold and enjoy!"}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 29}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to make 'melt and pour' soap?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure, I can help you with that!
