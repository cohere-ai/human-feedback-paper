A multi-shielded design (two 95% copper braids and 100% aluminum Mylar foil) provide optimum isolation from EMI and RFI interference for enhanced picture clarity. A nitrogen-injected foam dielectric maintains 75 Ohm impedance for optimum video signal transfer while the solid 99.97% pure, silver-coated, oxygen-free, copper center conductor provides exceptional signal transfer for accurate video reproduction. 3' length.\r\nProduct features:\r\n*24K gold plating\r\n*Precision machined 8 segment connectors\r\n*Nitrogen injected dielectric\r\n*Multi-shielded design\r\n*Pure silver coated oxygen-free copper", "Response B": "Playing and look like the MVP Stephen Curry!
