{"id": "947", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Conversation:\nJonathan: OK, that's a cut! Let's start from the beginning, everyone.\nAdam: What was the problem that time?\nJonathan: The feeling was all wrong, Mike. She is telling you that she doesn't want to see you any more, but I want to get more anger from you. You're acting hurt and sad, but that's not how your character would act in this situation.\nAdam: But Jason and Laura have been together for three years. Don't you think his reaction would be one of both anger and sadness?\nJonathan: At this point, no. I think he would react the way most guys would, and then later on, we would see his real feelings.\nAdam: I'm not so sure about that.\nJonathan: Let's try it my way, and you can see how you feel when you're saying your lines. After that, if it still doesn't feel right, we can try something else.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "Jonathan and Mike are discussing what kind of emotion should be expressed by Mike in this play. They have different understandings.", "Response B": "In this conversation, Jonathan, the director of the movie, is giving feedback to Adam, the actor playing the character Jason. Jonathan is explaining that the feeling in the scene is not right, and that he wants Adam to bring more anger to the character's emotions. Adam disagrees and explains that Jason and Laura have been together for three years, so his reaction would be a combination of anger and sadness. Jonathan argues that most guys would react differently and encourages Adam to try it his way. If it still doesn't feel right, they can try something different."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "dialogsum", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 33}, "label_annotations": {"email": "64628c9f876af71f257f6891_64b52ebcd4da933da0b020be", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "2", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "2", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "3", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "1", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "2", "creativity_b": "4", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 45s "}}
