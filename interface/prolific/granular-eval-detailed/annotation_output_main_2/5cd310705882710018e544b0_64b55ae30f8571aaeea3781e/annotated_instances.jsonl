The current assets under management of the biggest incumbent in the market today BlackRock is less than this. Of course, BlackRock, for example, is also a huge beneficiary of the growth is passive investing brought about both directly and indirectly through robo advice. In addition, the firm has a chunky stake in one of the UK market leaders Scalable Capital.\n\nWhile this all sounds very bullish for robo-advice, the report notes that total levels of assets managed by traditional players is likely to remain high as a percentage of total assets. Nonetheless, it says a broader process of 'digitisation' is occurring within the wealth management space.\n\n\"Digital transformation of the wealth management industry is not a pure technological challenge. As the likelihood of returning to pre-crisis revenue margins is remote, wealth managers need to reinvent their business model to adapt to existing clients' changing needs and to capture new clients while reducing operating expenses on a relative basis\" the report noted.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "University of Tokyo researchers have developed a new ink that can be printed on textiles in a single step to form highly conductive and stretchable connections, enabling sports garments to measure heart rate and muscle conditions. Currently, sensors are typically printed on fairly rigid surfaces, but these stretchy garments will be able to fit themselves to the human body. This ink is comprised of silver flakes, organic solvent, fluorine rubber and fluorine surfactant and ink exhibited high conductivity even when it was stretched to more than three times its original length.", "Response B": "Robo-advisers could have $2.2tn in global assets under management by 2020 and had the potential to surpass the likes of BlackRock by 2025, according to a recent study from Deloitte. Investors' preference for passive investing is behind an increase in flows towards the platforms. The desire of wealth managers to digitise their offerings in the face of squeezed profit margins is also driving the growth of robo-advice."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": "distractor_34"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5cd310705882710018e544b0_64b55ae30f8571aaeea3781e", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "4", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "1", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "3", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "4", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "Completely irrelevant "}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 31s "}}
