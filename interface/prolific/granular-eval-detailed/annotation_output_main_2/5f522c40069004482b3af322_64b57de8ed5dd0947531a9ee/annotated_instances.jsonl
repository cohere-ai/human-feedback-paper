{"id": "80", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Dive Brief:\n\nA K-12 chief information officer's time used to be spent primarily on IT tasks, but amid ed tech's increasing prevalence and a push for data-driven decision-making, CIOs have had to adapt and spend more time helping educators and administrators track and assess data.\n\nDistrict Administration reports CIOs serve as data interpreters and visionaries, facilitating understanding between technology departments and academic/operational branches of their districts and developing a long-term plan about where data fits into the district's strategic goals.\n\nCIOs also fulfill a training role, helping educators without data backgrounds gain insights from analytics, and they break down silos by connecting people from various departments with data to meet continuous improvement goals.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThere is much talk about how schools haven't changed at all in centuries, but the fact is school and district leaders have had a lot to adapt to in recent years. The digital age has brought a range of new technologies into schools, and that has provided new opportunities for data collection and analysis. Schools are behind other sectors in embracing this potential, however.\n\nA recent report from public policy think tank the Center for Data Innovation urged federal and state policymakers to incentivize faster adoption in schools and districts. Beyond encouraging administrators to use data to improve their operations and instructional practices, the Center for Data Innovation wants schools to get data into the hands of students and parents, giving them more agency over the learning process.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "K-12 schools are under increasing pressure to embrace data-driven decision-making, and the head of one of the nation's largest school districts is trying to do just that. The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) recently appointed chief information officer Fitna Ashgar as chief academic officer, which means that she will now focus more on helping educators collect and analyse data. \"This is a school that is going to be led by data,\" said Ashgar. \"This is a school that is going to be led by the academic mission, and we are going to be led by data.\" The move is part of a wider effort to modernise the school. As part of a five-year plan to improve the quality of LAUSD's instruction, the district is in the process of implementing a series of new technologies in classrooms. Among the technologies are mobile devices for teachers, tablets for students, and the implementation of a cloud-based learning management system. The district is also investing in professional development for teachers, providing them with support to help them integrate these technologies into their lessons.", "Response B": "The demand for greater transparency and accountability within K-12 has pushed educators to prioritize data-driven decision-making. As a result, the role of the CIO has evolved to include data interpreter and visionary, helping to facilitate understanding between technology departments and academic/operational branches of districts. A key responsibility for the CIO is to break down silos and connect people from various departments with data to meet continuous improvement goals.\n\nTo fulfill this new role, the CIO must have a deep understanding of how data is collected and analyzed, and an even deeper understanding of how to translate it into actionable insights for stakeholders. This requires the CIO to work closely with other district leaders to develop a long-term plan for how data can be integrated into the district's strategic goals.\n\nSource:\n\nDistrict Administration"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 25}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5f522c40069004482b3af322_64b57de8ed5dd0947531a9ee", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "4", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "2", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "1", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "4", "feedback": "Option A has information that was not presented in the prompts \"The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) recently appointed chief information officer Fitna Ashgar\"\r\nOption B is not much more concise than the entire prompt either."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 8m 51s "}}
