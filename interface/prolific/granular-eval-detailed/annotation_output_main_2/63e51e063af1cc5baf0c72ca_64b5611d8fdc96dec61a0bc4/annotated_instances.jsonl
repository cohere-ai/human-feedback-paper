I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from ShareProphets). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.\n\nIt would appear that with Arrow Global Group (ARW) we have a situation whereby the long game has been played by the bulls to date, but that we may finally be due a decent extended rally after the extended base has been made.\n\nFiled under:\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Arrow Global Group (ARW) is an international credit management business with operations in the UK, Europe and North America. Arrow provides a range of services to creditors, including purchasing of loans, debt collection and litigation support. Arrow has experienced a period of strong growth, particularly in North America where the business has been rapidly expanding through both organic growth and acquisitions.\n\nThe company's shares are quoted on the London Stock Exchange and have been in a downtrend since April 2014, from a high of 475p. In the past six months, the shares have traded in a range of 235p to 300p.\n\nThe company's financial year end is 31 December, and in the year ended 31 December 2014, Arrow generated profit before tax of \u00a354.3 million (2013: \u00a343.3 million). This growth was primarily attributable to organic growth in the UK, Europe and North America, as well as acquisitions in North America.\n\nThe group's revenue for the year ended 31 December 2014 was \u00a3139.0 million (2013: \u00a3116.0 million).
