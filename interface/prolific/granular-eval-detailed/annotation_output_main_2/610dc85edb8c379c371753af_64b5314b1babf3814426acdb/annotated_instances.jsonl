The three-piece set of red, blue, and green cables are each 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) long.  The multi-shielded design, nitrogen injected dielectric, and pure silver coated oxygen-free copper all work together to provide an improved signal transmission.  The 24K gold plating on the precision machined 8 segment connectors ensures long-lasting, corrosion-free connections.  The male end of the cables are standard RCA connectors.", "Response B": "Wow, this sounds like an amazing cable for connecting audio and video components!  Some of the key features include 24K gold plating for superior conductivity, precision machined 8 segment connectors for a secure connection, and nitrogen injected dielectric and multi-shielding for enhanced signal clarity and noise rejection.  These cables are also made with pure silver coated oxygen-free copper wiring for enhanced signal transmission.  Overall this sounds like a high quality, high performance cable that will deliver exceptional audio and video performance!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "amazon", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 42}, "label_annotations": {"email": "610dc85edb8c379c371753af_64b5314b1babf3814426acdb", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "2", "confidence_a": "4", "confidence_b": "3", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "3", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "3", "clarity_b": "2", "creativity_a": "1", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "Yes", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "They state the cables are 4.9ft yet description says 3ft", "factors_b": "No. "}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 25s "}}
