First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "The summary is consistent with the document because it accurately reflects the main point of the article, which is that the CEO of Domino's has admitted that the company \"did not get the balance right\" after increasing delivery prices to counter inflation. The summary also mentions that the company's first-half profits dropped by more than 20 percent.\nNo", "Response B": "Yes, the summary is consistent with the document.
