Involve your kids in meal planning and preparation. This can help them feel invested in the meal and more likely to try new foods.\n2. Offer a variety of healthy foods at mealtime, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.\n3. Make healthy food fun by cutting food into fun shapes or using dips to make them more appealing.\n4. Avoid using food as a reward or punishment. This can create negative associations with healthy foods.\n5. Be a role model and eat healthy foods yourself. Kids are more likely to adopt healthy habits if their parents do, too.\n\nRemember, it may take time and patience to get your kids to try new foods, but with consistency and positive reinforcement, they can learn to enjoy a variety of healthy foods."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 42}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5b421b9ac2e3810001763252_64b53510a4bef2d6b33497c8", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "2", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "3", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "3", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "2", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "2", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "3", "creativity_b": "4", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "Yes", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "there is jargon talk in this response it is just sentences, no real explanations.", "factors_b": "this response is very high quality and informative and there is many good points to the the request and good advice.", "feedback": "n/a"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 7m 30s "}}
