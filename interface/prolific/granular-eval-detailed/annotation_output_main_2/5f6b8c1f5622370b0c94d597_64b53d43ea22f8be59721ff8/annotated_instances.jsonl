Teacher advisor is designed to help teachers:\n\nAccess quality resources to meet diverse classroom needs;\n\nUnderstand the standards and prerequisites for each lesson to better close gaps for students;\n\nApply new teaching techniques; and\n\nReceive targeted recommendations for specific math concepts.\n\nTeaching materials available through the online tool come from Achieve, AFT's Share My Lesson, CPALMS, EngageNY, Illustrative Mathematics, Student Achievement Partners and UnboundEd.\n\n\"Time is of the essence for teachers,\" said Sheena Lee, an elementary school teacher at Umana Academy in Boston, MA, in a prepared statement. \"With a classroom full of third through fifth graders who have had inconsistent education in their lives, I need to help my students learn math in different ways, at different levels. Teacher Advisor With Watson offers a one-stop shop for the most trusted resources, enabling me to decide how best to meet my students where they are.\"\n\n\"Teachers shoulder endless challenges and responsibilities \u2014 mastering content, standards and curriculum, and meeting the diverse needs and abilities of each of their students,\" said AFT President Randi Weingarten in a news release. \"Too often, teachers are expected to do all this single-handedly, but Teacher Advisor could help change that. The AFT worked hand-in-glove with the IBM Foundation to hone this tool and see how it empowers teachers and benefits students. This effective public-private partnership is a testament to what can be achieved when educators are entrusted with innovative technology to support powerful learning.\"\n\nVisit teacheradvisor.education to learn more.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "IBM is launching a tool for maths teachers powered by artificial intelligence (AI) to help them with targeted resources for students.
