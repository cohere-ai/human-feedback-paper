{"234": {"id": "234", "text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make a punching bag stand?", "Response A": "Sure!  A punching bag stand is a fun DIY project, and it\u2019s pretty easy to make.  You\u2019ll need a few supplies, including a long piece of wood, some screws or nails, and a large plastic trash bag.  First, cut the wood to size.  You\u2019ll want it to be about four feet long and two inches wide.  Then, drill holes into the wood at intervals of about six inches.  You\u2019ll want to drill two holes at each interval, one near the top of the wood and one near the bottom.  Then, fill the holes with screws or nails.  Make sure the nails or screws are sturdy, so they\u2019ll hold the bag securely.  Then, place a trash bag over the top of the wood, and secure it in place with some duct tape.  You\u2019ll want to make sure the bag is securely attached to the wood, so it won\u2019t fall off when you punch it.  Then, all you have to do is fill the bag with soft items, like old clothes", "Response B": "Sure, I\u2019ll give you some options.  First, you could use a stand like this.  It has a base that you can put in a hole in the floor, and then you can set the bag on top of that.  Or you could use a stand like this.
