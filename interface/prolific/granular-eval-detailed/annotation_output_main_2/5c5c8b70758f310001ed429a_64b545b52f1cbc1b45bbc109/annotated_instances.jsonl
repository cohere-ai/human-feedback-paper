You may also feel like you\u2019re missing out on something, like the opportunity to be young again, or to have more time.  You may be experiencing an \u201cin-between\u201d feeling, where you\u2019re not sure what to do with your life, or where to turn.  This can be a very difficult time for people, and it can be hard to know where to turn.", "Response B": "Face your problems.\nFind new goals.\nAppreciate the life you have.\nMake informed choices.\nGet some advice.\nMove forward, not backward.\nSpend some time alone.\nRelax.\nAvoid turning to alcohol and drugs.\nWork through depression and anxiety.\nJournal.\nSee a therapist."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 39}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5c5c8b70758f310001ed429a_64b545b52f1cbc1b45bbc109", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "2", "style_b": "3", "confidence_a": "3", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "2", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "3", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "2", "creativity_b": "2", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "Response A does not answer the prompt but instead just states what a midlife crisis is rather than how to overcome it", "factors_b": "Response B just provides a list of information rather than put it into a paragraph.
