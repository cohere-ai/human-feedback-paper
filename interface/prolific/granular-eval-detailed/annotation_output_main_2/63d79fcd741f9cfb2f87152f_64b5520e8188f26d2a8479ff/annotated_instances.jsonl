{"id": "583", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make 'melt and pour' soap?", "Response A": "Sure, here\u2019s how you can make a bar of soap with a melt and pour process.  First, you\u2019ll need to melt some soap base.  You can find soap base at most craft stores.  Then you\u2019ll want to pour the soap base into a mold.  You can find soap molds at most craft stores as well.  Then you\u2019ll want to wait until the soap has cooled completely, and then you\u2019ll want to remove the soap from the mold.  You can then use it as a bar of soap.", "Response B": "Sure, I can help you with that!  First, you\u2019ll need to get some soap base.  You can buy it from a soap store, or you can make it yourself.  Once you have the soap base, you\u2019ll need to mix it with some oils, like vegetable oil or coconut oil.  You can also add some color to the soap, like green or pink.  Once you have the soap base, you\u2019ll need to pour it into a soap mold.  You can buy soap molds from a soap store, or you can make your own soap molds from a variety of materials.  Once you have the soap mold, you\u2019ll need to pour the soap base into it.  You\u2019ll need to wait until the soap base is completely solid, then you can remove it from the soap mold.  Once you have the soap base, you\u2019ll need to cut it into bars, and you can then use it to make soap."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 29}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d79fcd741f9cfb2f87152f_64b5520e8188f26d2a8479ff", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "3", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "2", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "2", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "2", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "Yes", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "3", "feedback": "Response A is more concise and adequately answered the question by suggesting to get specific materials in a crafts shop.\r\nOption B is more detailed but it does not give concrete guidance.
