In a single-step process, electrodes and wires can be printed on both surfaces of the textile using the wonder ink.

The conductive ink is soft and stretchy, and can be stretched to three times its length without losing conductivity, which allows for the creation of flexible electronic circuits on fabric materials.  The ink could be used to create wearable electronic devices that are soft and stretchy like clothing, as well as electronic sensors and circuits embedded in textiles.  The development of the conductive ink represents a significant step forward in the field of printable electronics, and could have numerous applications in the creation of flexible electronic devices and sensors.", "Response B": "Japanese researchers have created a printable conducive ink on cloth, which means your boxer briefs or sports bra could one day track your heart rate (among other things).\n\nIn an effort to make electronic wearables more wearable, a team at the University of Tokyo developed the ink and announced it yesterday.
