{"594": {"id": "594", "text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to overcome a midlife crisis?", "Response A": "Sure!  You\u2019re not alone -- lots of people go through midlife crises.  A midlife crisis is really just a period of transition and self-examination, often triggered by changes in life circumstances.  A common experience is feeling stuck in a rut, or questioning what you\u2019ve accomplished so far in life, and wondering if you\u2019re on the right path.  There\u2019s no one right way to get through a midlife crisis, but here are some ideas: you could try getting in touch with old friends, or making a new friend, and talking about your feelings.  You could try taking some time for yourself, to do the things that make you feel most happy and fulfilled.  You could also try making some changes in your life, like taking on a new hobby or challenge, or changing your routine in some way.  Or you could try talking to a therapist or other counselor, who can help you work through these feelings.", "Response B": "A midlife crisis can be a difficult time, but there are some things you can do to overcome it. First, try to identify what is causing the crisis, which could be a range of factors such as work stress, relationship issues, or an existential crisis. Then, try to work on those issues and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist. It's also important to remember that change is a natural part of life, and there are many opportunities to reinvent yourself and make positive changes. Finally, focus on self-care and try to find new hobbies or activities that you enjoy to help you through this difficult time."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 39}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to overcome a midlife crisis?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure!
