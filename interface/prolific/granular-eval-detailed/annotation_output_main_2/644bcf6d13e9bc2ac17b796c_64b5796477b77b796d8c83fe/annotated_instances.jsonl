{"id": "141", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Given the document below, determine if the summary is factually consistent with the document. \nDocument: Frappuccinos are passe and milk and two sugars is practically prehistoric - the next coffee trend involves olive oil and it's launching in Italy on Wednesday.\n\nStarbucks is debuting a range of olive oil-infused drinks in its 20 Italian stores, with plans to bring the drinks to the UK later this year.\n\nChief executive Howard Schultz said the idea struck him when he adopted the Italian custom of taking a daily spoonful of olive oil while travelling in Sicily last year.\n\nHe said he started adding it to his coffee and found it produced an \"unexpected, velvety, buttery flavour that enhanced the coffee and lingers beautifully on the palate\".\n\nThe Oleato olive oil range includes a latte, cold brew and the \"Oleato deconstructed\", which pairs espresso with olive oil \"infused with a luxurious passionfruit cold foam\".\n\n\"Now, there's going to be people who say, 'Olive oil in coffee? But the proof is in the cup,\" Mr Schultz said.\n\n\"In over 40 years, I can't remember a moment in time where I've been more excited, more enthused that demonstrates the pride, the quality, the passion, the heritage and the craft of what Starbucks can do.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:43 Three cups of coffee a day could help you live longer\n\nThe drinks will be available in Southern California in the spring, while the UK, Japan and the Middle East will see the range on the menu later this year.\n\nStarbucks opened its first branch in Italy in 2018, causing outcry and prompting calls for a boycott.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProtesters even set fire to palm trees planted by Starbucks in Milan.\n\nLast year pizza chain Domino's pulled out of Italy after failing to win over the ancestral home of pizza.\n\nIt had planned to open hundreds of stores by 2030, counting on its delivery model to boost popularity - but when the pandemic forced traditional pizzerias to deliver, it lost its edge.\nSummary: Starbucks faced a boycott when it first opened in Italy in 2018 - but the chain has come back swinging with an olive oil range of coffee launching in France on Wednesday.\nIs the summary consistent with the document? First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "Yes, the summary is consistent with the document. The summary accurately captures the main points mentioned in the document, which are that Starbucks is launching an olive oil range of coffee in Italy and that the drink will be available in other countries later this year. The summary also discusses the backlash that Starbucks faced when it first opened in Italy and the challenges of establishing itself in the country. Therefore, the summary is factually consistent with the document.", "Response B": "The summary is not factually consistent with the document. The launch of the olive oil range is in Italy, not France. Starbucks opened its first Italian branch in 2018, causing outcry and prompting calls for a boycott. The article does not state that the olive oil range is launching in France.\nNo"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "factualnlg", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 34}, "label_annotations": {"email": "644bcf6d13e9bc2ac17b796c_64b5796477b77b796d8c83fe", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "2", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "Yes", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 44s "}}
