{"id": "727", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Conversation:\nJessica: Are you going to the demonstration to help stop the spread of nuclear weapons tomorrow, Cleo?\nBen: No, Simon. I hate demonstrations. I have heard the police will be standing by with tear gas.\nJessica: Yes, but North Korea boasts it has nuclear arms.\nBen: One hundred ninety countries have signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty but the issues are just too complex. There are two sides to every story. I don't understand it and I have no intention of going to a demonstration. Demonstrations don't seem to accomplish anything anyway.\nJessica: Several demonstrations have changed politician's minds throughout history. As a responsible citizen I think it is important to stand up for what you believe in.\nBen: Leave it to someone else. As I said, if you listen to both sides of a story, both sides have some good points. Why should I demonstrate and risk getting hurt for something that I am not even sure is right?\nJessica: You are not likely to get hurt. This will be a peaceful demonstration. I have spoken to the organizer for the university group. He insists that this will be peaceful. He advocates if you want world peace, peace begins at home-and that means right here in this city.\nBen: You go if you want, Simon, but I plan to study for my physics exam.\nJessica: It would only take two hours of your day. The bus leaves the campus at 11:30 and leaves downtown to return to campus at 12:45. You could eat your lunch on the bus.\nBen: I am not going, Simon. Why don't you ask the students in your political science class this afternoon if they want to go?\nJessica: They are all going.\nBen: Okay, Simon. I need to meet my sister for coffee now.\nJessica: Bye then. See you in physics class tomorrow.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "Jessica tries to convince Ben to attend a demonstration to protest the spread of nuclear weapons. However, Ben refuses to go, stating that demonstrations don't solve anything and that it's too risky to participate. Jessica argues that demonstrations have changed politicians' minds throughout history and that it's important to stand up for what one believes in. Ben insists that he has to study for his physics exam and refuses to attend the demonstration. Jessica suggests that Ben asks his political science classmates if they want to go in his place. Eventually, Ben agrees to attend a demonstration, but only if it is peaceful.", "Response B": "Simon and Cleo have different opinions towards the demonstration to help stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Cleo thinks it is useless, while Simon considers that Cleo should go to the demonstration."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "dialogsum", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 36}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d13c076dd249ca3a6bffbb_64b5437851e213dfce5b6d6e", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "3", "confidence_a": "4", "confidence_b": "3", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "3", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "1", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "3", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "2", "factors_a": "No, scored low based on the error even though it was a concise summary", "factors_b": "No - scored low due to the lack of detail"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 7m 32s "}}
