{"id": "854", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Dive Brief:\n\nPeter West, director of eLearning at Saint Stephen's College in Australia, writes for eSchool News that humans have 40,000 years of communicating with pen-like instruments and that students lose something when they move completely to writing with keyboards.\n\nResearch shows students who take lecture notes on a keyboard are more likely to transcribe content mindlessly, which leads to lower performance on factual recall as well as conceptual learning in short- and long-term tests \u2014 and even though students say they prefer keyboards, pens actually support their performance better.\n\nand even though students say they prefer keyboards, pens actually support their performance better. Additional research shows keyboards constrain subjects that use symbols, limit creativity and increase cognitive load, and West encourages teachers to consider using digital pen and paper to capitalize on the benefits of the writing implement as well as connected and collaborative technology.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMany have bemoaned the loss of handwriting among students. Many schools are no longer required to teach cursive. Perhaps the shift has been too complete with the advent of the computer. But technology companies aren't throwing away the commitment to pen and paper.\n\nIn its release of upgrades for the 2016-17 school year, Microsoft Classroom expanded the number of color options for its stylus in OneNote and added a math assistant that can identify whether students are solving a math problem correctly, as well as show what method would lead to a correct answer. Teachers now have the opportunity to revive handwriting without foregoing the digital world.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "As digital tools continue to become ubiquitous in schools, teachers are being encouraged to consider the benefits of using digital pen and paper to capitalize on the benefits of the writing implement as well as connected and collaborative technology.", "Response B": "Peter West, director of eLearning at Saint Stephen's College in Australia, has argued that keyboards are not the best way for students to take notes in class. Research shows students who type their notes on a keyboard tend to transcribe content mindlessly, which leads to lower performance on factual recall and conceptual learning in short and long term tests. West suggests that teachers consider using digital pen and paper to capitalise on the benefits of the writing implement as well as connected and collaborative technology."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 30}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d55b7ef6a0f930017202336_64b537be466ce3391fc37e1b", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "3", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "3", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "4", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "A was more savvy, more reportage and very top line, so not necessarily a good summary but a really nice writing style ", "factors_b": "B was more factual and took information from the prompt, and it had more detail "}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 6m 35s "}}
