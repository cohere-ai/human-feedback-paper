A multi-shielded design (two 95% copper braids and 100% aluminum Mylar foil) provide optimum isolation from EMI and RFI interference for enhanced picture clarity. A nitrogen-injected foam dielectric maintains 75 Ohm impedance for optimum video signal transfer while the solid 99.97% pure, silver-coated, oxygen-free, copper center conductor provides exceptional signal transfer for accurate video reproduction. 3' length.\r\nProduct features:\r\n*24K gold plating\r\n*Precision machined 8 segment connectors\r\n*Nitrogen injected dielectric\r\n*Multi-shielded design\r\n*Pure silver coated oxygen-free copper", "Response B": "Your client wants the product description to be fun and engaging.\nThis product is perfect for those who love to watch movies or play video games in high definition. The red, blue, and green wires provide a sharp and clear image while the 24k gold plating ensures a long lasting and reliable connection. The precision machined 8 segment connectors add durability and strength, while the nitrogen injected dielectric provides superior insulation. This product is sure to exceed your expectations and provide a great viewing experience."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "amazon", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 42}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63ef94c96aa1debba6d1c407_64b5472b81956d16e8efbe96", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "2", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "2", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "2", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "1", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "2", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "1", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "Yes", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "2", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "no"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 57s "}}
