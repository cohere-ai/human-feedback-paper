{"id": "385", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to encourage kids to eat healthier foods?", "Response A": "Sure. One way is to tell them about the health benefits of the foods you want them to eat. For example, you could tell them that fruits and vegetables contain lots of vitamins and minerals that will help them stay healthy. You could also tell them that eating vegetables helps them grow, and that eating fruits provides them with important nutrients.", "Response B": "Here are a few tips to encourage kids to eat healthier foods:\n\n1. Involve your kids in meal planning and preparation. This can help them feel invested in the meal and more likely to try new foods.\n2. Offer a variety of healthy foods at mealtime, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.\n3. Make healthy food fun by cutting food into fun shapes or using dips to make them more appealing.\n4. Avoid using food as a reward or punishment. This can create negative associations with healthy foods.\n5. Be a role model and eat healthy foods yourself. Kids are more likely to adopt healthy habits if their parents do, too.\n\nRemember, it may take time and patience to get your kids to try new foods, but with consistency and positive reinforcement, they can learn to enjoy a variety of healthy foods."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 42}, "label_annotations": {"email": "64217d8202361ad4dbed3596_64b563bb183d6f07b15e4be5", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "3", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "3", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "2", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "2", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "1", "creativity_b": "4", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "4", "feedback": "A) was very generic, basic and not very practical.
