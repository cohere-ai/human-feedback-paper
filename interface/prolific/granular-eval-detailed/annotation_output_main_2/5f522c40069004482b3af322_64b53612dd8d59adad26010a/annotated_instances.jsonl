Thanks for agreeing to meet with us about the new account. My associate, Susan Kim, should be here any minute. Would you like something to drink while we're waiting?\nOlivia: No, thanks. I'm fine. Did you have a nice holiday?\nMarie: Yes, I did. My family and I went to Tahoe to ski and the weather was great. How about you?\nOlivia: I stayed in L. A. and it was sunny the entire weekend. We spent most of the time at home but we did go see King Kong on Christmas day.\nMarie: How did you like it?\nOlivia: It was better than I expected. But, you know, I think I would have enjoyed skiing in Tahoe even better. Do you go there often?\nMarie: No, not much. My wife doesn't like to ski. She prefers vacationing where it's warmer, like Hawaii.\nOlivia: I don't blame her. I really enjoyed it there when we went a few years ago. I'd like to go back sometime soon.\nMarie: Yes, me too. Oh, here's Susan now. Let me introduce you.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "Marie and Olivia are having a conversation about their Christmas holidays.
