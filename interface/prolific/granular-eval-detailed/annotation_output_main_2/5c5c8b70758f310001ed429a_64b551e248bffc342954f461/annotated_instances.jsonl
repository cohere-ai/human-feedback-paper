{"id": "584", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Given the document below, determine if the summary is factually consistent with the document. \nDocument: An open pit mine collapsed in China's northern Inner Mongolia region on Wednesday, killing at least two people and leaving more than 50 missing, state media reported.\n\nThe official Xinhua News Agency said people were buried under debris at the mine in Alxa League. Rescuers brought out three people, two of whom showed no signs of life.\n\nOther state media reports gave the total number of missing at 57 and said numerous vehicles were also buried in the collapse.\n\nCHINA SHARPLY CRITICIZES PENTAGON AFTER DEFENSE OFFICIAL VISITED TAIWAN\n\nInner Mongolia is a key region for mining coal and other minerals in China, which critics say has ravaged the original landscape of mountains, grassy steppe and deserts.\n\nCHINA FURIOUS AFTER US WARNS AGAINST ARMING RUSSIA: 'THE US IS IN NO POSITION TO TELL CHINA WHAT TO DO'\n\nChina overwhelmingly relies on coal for power generation, but has strived to reduce the number of deadly mine accidents through a greater emphasis on safety and the closure of smaller operations that lacked necessary equipment.\n\nMost mining deaths are attributed to explosions caused by the buildup of methane and coal dust, or to drownings caused when miners break into shafts that had been abandoned due to flooding.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nChina has recorded a slew of deadly industrial and construction accidents in recent months as a result of poor safety training and regulation, official corruption and a tendency to cut corners by companies seeking to eek out profits. The economy has slowed, partly as a result of draconian lockdowns and quarantines imposed under the now-abandoned \"zero-COVID\" policy.\nSummary: A Chinese mine collapse killed at least three people and left over 50 others missing. Chinese officials say numerous vehicles were also found inside the collapse.\nIs the summary consistent with the document? First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "The summary is not factually consistent with the article because the article says that two people were found dead, not three. The article also says that the number of missing people was 57, not over 50. The article also says that the mine was in Inner Mongolia, not in China.\nNo", "Response B": "The summary is factually consistent with the document, as it accurately reflects the contents of the text, which states that a Chinese mine collapse killed at least three people and left over 50 others missing.\n\nYes"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "factualnlg", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 44}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5c5c8b70758f310001ed429a_64b551e248bffc342954f461", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "3", "style_b": "3", "confidence_a": "3", "confidence_b": "3", "useful_a": "3", "useful_b": "3", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "2", "factors_a": "Response A is correct in part however its reasoning is incorrect. 57 people is over 50 people and \"northern Inner Mongolia\" is a part of China ", "factors_b": "Response B is incorrect as the prompt states that at least 2 people died but the response agrees that 3 people died, therefore it is not factually consistent"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 9m 4s "}}
