It's also important to not make loud noises while eating and to avoid reaching across the table to grab something. Additionally, it's important to not eat too quickly or too slowly and to avoid using your hands to eat certain foods.", "Response B": "Sit up straight at the table.This will give people a good first impression.But try not to look stiff and nervous,this will put them on edge.\nIf you are served first, do not start eating until the other guests at you table are served too.\nTo cut something,you stab your fork into it, but be careful and do this gently.\nIf you need something,do not reach across the table to get it.\nWhen or if pouring drinks,ask the people do they want refills.\nIf eating soup,do not slurp.\nDo not wave your knife, fork, spoon etc.\nWhen you burp or yawn,cover your mouth with your hand.\nDo not pick your nose.\nIf you need to fart, excuse yourself to the bathroom."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 35}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to eat mannerly?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Eating mannerly typically involves using proper table etiquette, such as using a napkin, sitting up straight at the table, avoiding talking with your mouth full, and using utensils properly.
