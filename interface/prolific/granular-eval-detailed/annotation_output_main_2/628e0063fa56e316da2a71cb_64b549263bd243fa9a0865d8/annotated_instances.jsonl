Some of the key features include 24K gold plating for superior conductivity, precision machined 8 segment connectors for a secure connection, and nitrogen injected dielectric and multi-shielding for enhanced signal clarity and noise rejection.  These cables are also made with pure silver coated oxygen-free copper wiring for enhanced signal transmission.  Overall this sounds like a high quality, high performance cable that will deliver exceptional audio and video performance!", "Response B": "AR Pro Series II component video cable carries signals along three separate paths to achieve optimum picture quality. 24K gold-plated, split center pin and an 8 segment RCA connector delivers precise connections and lowers signal resistance for enhanced picture clarity. A multi-shielded design (two 95% copper braids and 100% aluminum Mylar foil) provide optimum isolation from EMI and RFI interference for enhanced picture clarity. A nitrogen-injected foam dielectric maintains 75 Ohm impedance for optimum video signal transfer while the solid 99.97% pure, silver-coated, oxygen-free, copper center conductor provides exceptional signal transfer for accurate video reproduction. 3' length.\r\nProduct features:\r\n*24K gold plating\r\n*Precision machined 8 segment connectors\r\n*Nitrogen injected dielectric\r\n*Multi-shielded design\r\n*Pure silver coated oxygen-free copper"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "amazon", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 42}, "label_annotations": {"email": "628e0063fa56e316da2a71cb_64b549263bd243fa9a0865d8", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "2", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "2", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "3", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "Response A failed to use the title.", "factors_b": "Response B went and found product information not contained in the article but after checking using Google and Amazon I could verify what it stated was 100% correct.", "feedback": "Not sure if it is okay that Response B found product details that were totally correct an listed in product listing elsewhere on the web but not in the article text itself.
