{"id": "207", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Given the document below, determine if the summary is factually consistent with the document. \nDocument: An open pit mine collapsed in China's northern Inner Mongolia region on Wednesday, killing at least two people and leaving more than 50 missing, state media reported.\n\nThe official Xinhua News Agency said people were buried under debris at the mine in Alxa League. Rescuers brought out three people, two of whom showed no signs of life.\n\nOther state media reports gave the total number of missing at 57 and said numerous vehicles were also buried in the collapse.\n\nCHINA SHARPLY CRITICIZES PENTAGON AFTER DEFENSE OFFICIAL VISITED TAIWAN\n\nInner Mongolia is a key region for mining coal and other minerals in China, which critics say has ravaged the original landscape of mountains, grassy steppe and deserts.\n\nCHINA FURIOUS AFTER US WARNS AGAINST ARMING RUSSIA: 'THE US IS IN NO POSITION TO TELL CHINA WHAT TO DO'\n\nChina overwhelmingly relies on coal for power generation, but has strived to reduce the number of deadly mine accidents through a greater emphasis on safety and the closure of smaller operations that lacked necessary equipment.\n\nMost mining deaths are attributed to explosions caused by the buildup of methane and coal dust, or to drownings caused when miners break into shafts that had been abandoned due to flooding.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nChina has recorded a slew of deadly industrial and construction accidents in recent months as a result of poor safety training and regulation, official corruption and a tendency to cut corners by companies seeking to eek out profits. The economy has slowed, partly as a result of draconian lockdowns and quarantines imposed under the now-abandoned \"zero-COVID\" policy.\nSummary: A Chinese mine collapse killed at least three people and left over 40 others missing. Chinese officials say no vehicles were buried in the collapse.\nIs the summary consistent with the document? First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "The summary does not accurately reflect the contents of the document. The document reports that two people were killed and 50 are missing, while the summary reports that three people were brought out of the mine and 57 are missing. Additionally, the summary reports that numerous vehicles were buried in the collapse, while the document does not mention this. Finally, the summary reports that the mine was located in Inner Mongolia, China, while the document does not specify the location of the mine. Overall, the summary is not consistent with the document.", "Response B": "The summary is factually inconsistent with the provided document because the document says numerous vehicles were buried in the collapse, while the summary says China officials said no vehicles were buried in the collapse."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "factualnlg", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 26}, "label_annotations": {"email": "62fb79e7c968f4fc555d1e2f_64b573d603804c93c3ca8be3", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "3", "style_b": "3", "confidence_a": "2", "confidence_b": "2", "useful_a": "3", "useful_b": "3", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "2", "clarity_a": "3", "clarity_b": "3", "creativity_a": "2", "creativity_b": "2", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "3", "feedback": "there is no summary"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 3s "}}
