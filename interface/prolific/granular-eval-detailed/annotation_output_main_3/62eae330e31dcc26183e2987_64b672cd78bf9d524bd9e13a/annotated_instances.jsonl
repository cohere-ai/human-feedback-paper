The market research was commissioned by B3i and carried out by Stern Stewart & Co, with 15 B3i members and 23 market testers. The study found that 78% of insurers and brokers and 91% of reinsurers thought the platform was highly relevant to their business. Based on stated volumes and market size, premiums that will be ceded to the B3i platform are estimated to be in the range of $80bn to $140bn.", "Response B": "The Blockchain Insurance Industry Initiative (B3i) is to launch as a legal entity in early 2018, following its formation earlier this year. The initiative is backed by 38 insurers, brokers and reinsurers, including those from China, South Africa, Singapore and the US. The average efficiency improvement across the value chain is estimated to be around 12%.
