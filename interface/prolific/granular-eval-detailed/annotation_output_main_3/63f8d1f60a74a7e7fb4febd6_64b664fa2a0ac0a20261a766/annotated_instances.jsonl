They believed they held the raw materials to allow scientists to breed the super plants of the future, crops that could survive anything nature could throw at them.\n\nThe Institute's founder, Nikolai Vavilov, had spent years collecting rare and wild relatives of wheat, rye and other staples so crop breeders could mine their hardy genes. Now the Nazis had laid siege to Leningrad (now St Petersburg), preventing the institute's workers from leaving the city. So the botanists barricaded themselves in with the stash, preparing to defend it from rats, freezing weather and desperately hungry citizens.\n\nLesser scientists would have eaten the precious packs of rice, wheat, peas, oats and potatoes during the 28-month siege. Instead, Dmitri S Ivanov, the head of the rice collection, a bespectacled man with fine, side-parted hair, painstakingly conserved several thousand packs of rice while gradually succumbing to malnutrition.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Statoil will buy a 25% stake in the Roncador oil field off Brazil from Petroleo Brasileiro (Petrobras) for as much as $2.9bn, tripling its presence in its biggest growth market outside Norway. The Campos Basin field still holds recoverable resources of more than 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent after producing since the 1990s, Statoil said. Statoil has taken advantage of lower asset prices during crude's slump and a Petrobras divestment program to build its position in Brazil.", "Response B": "Botanists are trying to find rare wild seed strains that can survive our climate change before they die out so as to ensure future global food supplies. These \"seed hunters\" are particularly keen to find strains that survive in harsh, arid places so they may share genes that help crops weather our future climate. For centuries, farmers have been selecting crops that are productive, sweeter and easy to peel but at the same time sacrificing other traits, leaving us with a \"pampered offspring\" of plants; the search is on to recover the lost \"tough\" genes. Crops are increasingly vulnerable to being wiped out by a single disaster so an array of plant genes are needed to protect ourselves from future hunger."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": "distractor_59"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63f8d1f60a74a7e7fb4febd6_64b664fa2a0ac0a20261a766", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "2", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "2", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "2", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "1", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "2", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "1", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "Yes", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "Yes", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "NO", "factors_b": "NO"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 5s "}}
