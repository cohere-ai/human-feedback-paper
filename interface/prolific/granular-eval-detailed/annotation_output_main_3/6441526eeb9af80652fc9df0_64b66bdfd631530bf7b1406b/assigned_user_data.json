First, let me explain a little about what credit is, and what it\u2019s used for.  When you buy something on credit, you\u2019re borrowing money from a bank or other lender, and agreeing to pay it back later.  So, when you borrow money, you\u2019re building up a credit history, which is a record of how you\u2019ve borrowed money in the past, and how you\u2019ve paid it back.  Credit history is important because it gives a sense of how responsible you are with money, and how likely you are to pay back any money you borrow in the future.
