First, you need to paint the walls and ceiling, then you can paint the furniture and decorate the room.  Here are some tips:\n\n- Pick a color that you like, and make sure it looks good with the furniture and other decorations in the room.\n\n- Use a paintbrush to apply the paint to the walls and ceiling, and a roller to apply it to the furniture and other decorations.\n\n- Allow the paint to dry completely before moving the furniture and other decorations back into the room.\n\n- Enjoy your new paint job!", "Response B": "Sure! You could paint the walls a light pink or purple, and you might want to paint a mural of flowers or the sky on one wall.  You could also buy some cute wall decor, like a clock or a painting, and paint them to match the walls.  And you might want to paint the furniture white or a light color.  If you want to paint a design on the floor, you could use a stencil or paint a pattern freehand."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 58}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to paint a girl's bedroom?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure!
