First, you need to paint the walls and ceiling, then you can paint the furniture and decorate the room.  Here are some tips:\n\n- Pick a color that you like, and make sure it looks good with the furniture and other decorations in the room.\n\n- Use a paintbrush to apply the paint to the walls and ceiling, and a roller to apply it to the furniture and other decorations.\n\n- Allow the paint to dry completely before moving the furniture and other decorations back into the room.\n\n- Enjoy your new paint job!", "Response B": "Sure! You could paint the walls a light pink or purple, and you might want to paint a mural of flowers or the sky on one wall.  You could also buy some cute wall decor, like a clock or a painting, and paint them to match the walls.  And you might want to paint the furniture white or a light color.  If you want to paint a design on the floor, you could use a stencil or paint a pattern freehand."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 58}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5ab10212fb22320001bacdfe_64b6685f1b20fce03ee23175", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "3", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "No ", "factors_b": "No", "feedback": "None"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 58s "}}
