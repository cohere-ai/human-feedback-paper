Avoid using multiple words or gestures for the same command. Use positive reinforcement to reward good behavior and avoid punishment or negative reinforcement for bad behavior. Also, be patient and consistent in your training sessions to ensure your dog understands what you are asking them to do.", "Response B": "Sure, I can help you with that.  In order to avoid confusing a dog, you should be clear and consistent with your commands, and avoid using multiple commands at once.  You should also make sure that you use a calm and calm tone of voice, and avoid using force or fear as a training method.  Finally, it\u2019s important to reward good behavior and ignore bad behavior, so that the dog is clear about which actions are good and which are bad.
