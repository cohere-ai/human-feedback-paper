Do you mean you want to avoid confusing a dog during training, or do you want to avoid confusing a dog during training?", "Response B": "It\u2019s a good idea to avoid sudden movements and loud noises around dogs, since these can startle or frighten them and make it harder for them to learn.  You can also try to keep a calm, gentle demeanor, speak in a soft voice, and offer treats or praise for good behavior.  Other helpful strategies include practicing training in a quiet, distraction-free environment, using hand signals in addition to verbal commands, and gradually introducing new commands or behaviors.  Overall, training a dog requires patience, positive reinforcement, and consistency, so it\u2019s important to take your time and avoid confusing or frightening the dog during training sessions."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 59}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to avoid confusing a dog during training?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            I\u2019m not sure I can help you with that.
