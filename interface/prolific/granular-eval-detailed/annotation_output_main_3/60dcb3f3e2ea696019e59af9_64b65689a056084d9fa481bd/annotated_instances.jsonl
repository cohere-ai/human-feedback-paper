Good beer, good music, and on top of that, there are so many hot girls here!\nCatherine: I'm with you on that. Check out that one over there. I think I'm in love!\nJennifer: well, she's alright, but not really my cup of tea. What about the blond with the red dress?\nCatherine: oh, that's Janice. She's just new in town. You have a thing for blonds, eh?\nJennifer: yeah! She could do anything she wants to me!\nCatherine: I bet. Why not go over and talk to her? She's really nice.\nJennifer: I don't think so. I get so nervous talking to girls. I always put my foot in my mouth, scare her off, and end up looking like a real fool. Besides, she is way out of my league.\nCatherine: come on! Man up! You'll never know until you try.\nJennifer: okay okay, just let me have another cup of beers to get my head in the game.\nCatherine: all right. But I think you ought to move soon.\nJennifer: why?\nCatherine: I can see five other guys eying her up.\nJennifer: okay, here I go!\nCatherine: good luck!\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "Jennifer is nervous to talk to the blond girl because she gets anxious around girls. Catherine encourages Jennifer to go over and talk to her. Jennifer agrees and after drinking another cup of beer, she tries to approach the girl but is hesitant because she is scared of being rejected. Catherine warns that other guys are also eyeing the girl up, so Jennifer quickly approaches her before anyone else can.", "Response B": "Catherine and Jennifer are at a party and enjoying themselves. They are talking about the women at the party and how they look. One of the women, Janice, is particularly attractive to both of them. They suggest that Jennifer talks to her, but she is hesitant due to her fear of talking to girls. Catherine convince her to go ahead and talk to her, but she is still hesitant. Jennifer goes up to Janice and talks to her."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "dialogsum", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 58}, "label_annotations": {"email": "60dcb3f3e2ea696019e59af9_64b65689a056084d9fa481bd", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "3", "style_b": "3", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "3", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No", "feedback": "The second one was better to read."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 41s "}}
