{"id": "931", "input_text": {"Prompt": "KUALA LUMPUR (March 8): CIMB Group Holdings Bhd and GHL Systems Bhd have teamed up to provide card payment services for CIMB's corporate clients in Thailand's retail and services segments.\n\nThe joint effort will be undertaken through their Thai subsidiaries, CIMB Thai Bank Ltd Bhd and GHL (Thailand) Co Ltd.\n\n\"It will enable CIMB Thai's merchants to accept credit card payment services at their premises and online transactions with GHL being the exclusive partner to service and manage these merchants,\" GHL said in a statement today.\n\nGHL said there is an estimated 400,000 electronic data capture (EDC) and point of sale (POS) terminals servicing 22 million credit cards and 48 million debit cards issued in Thailand.\n\nBoth GHL and CIMB Thai aim to sign up more merchants to provide alternative payment solutions rather than traditional cash payments.\n\nIt falls in line with Bank of Thailand's set target of two million new acceptance points to encourage the move from cash to electronic payments.\n\nCIMB Thai president and chief executive officer Kittiphun Anutarasoti said the partnership allows the bank to offer a complete and comprehensive cash management solution to expand its customer base.\n\nHe added that it would promote a cashless society through an alternative payment solution and reduce operation overheads for small-medium enterprises and large corporate clients.\n\nGHL group chief executive officer Danny Leong said the deal enables the company to leverage on its strengths and advantages.\n\n\"Thailand, like most of Asean, has an enormous small merchant segment and high street retail stores outside Bangkok that remain untapped for payments,\" Leong added.\n\nCIMB's share price closed down eight sen or 1.47% at RM5.37, valuing the group at RM47.6 billion, while GHL dipped one sen or 0.91% to close at RM1.09 for a market capitalisation of RM712.1 million.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The bankruptcy of Spain's renewable energy firm, Abengoa, highlights transition difficulties for energy firms to stable and solvent renewable energy companies.  It also, more poignantly, reveals how connected the economy is and how turbulence in the energy sector could easily spread to other sectors of the economy, thereby creating a broader economic slowdown at any given point. The company's declaration of bankruptcy sent Spanish banking shares tumbling due to concerns that the banks left holding Abengoa's debt may now face heavy losses and low recovery rates.  As the Financial Times pointed out last month, \"we don't believe that this should be viewed as a one-off.  To our minds, the events here show that Spanish banks have yet to take losses on a lot of debt\". Spanish banks are still reeling from the Eurozone crisis, and these developments will not help their quest for profitability and stability.", "Response B": "The Thai subsidiaries of lender CIMB and payment solutions provider GHL Systems partnered to provide card payment services for CIMB's corporate clients in Thailand's retail and services segment. GHL will become the only partner to service and manage the credit card payments of CIMB's Thai merchants, both on-premise and online. The companies intend to provide more merchants with alternative payments, in line with the Bank of Thailand's initiative to encourage the transition from cash to electronic payments by adding two million new acceptance points. CIMB's president said that the move would reduce operation overheads for its customer base."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": "distractor_50"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d5573a782c18d00015b9ea2_64b659d70f1c04d1a5e3b50f", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "1", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "3", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "3", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "2", "creativity_b": "2", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "Response A is not relevant to the prompt or to the topic being discussed", "factors_b": "Response B is a good, concise summary of the information in the prompt"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 6m 57s "}}
