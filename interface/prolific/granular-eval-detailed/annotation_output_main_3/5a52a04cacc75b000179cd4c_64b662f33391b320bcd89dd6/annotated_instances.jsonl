{"id": "760", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Do you enjoy eating mussels? Cool, same. Something, however, is happening to mussels as we know them. And it's changing them in a pretty horrifying way.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Chicago has been comparing the shells of live mussels pulled from the Pacific coast today with historical shells, some of them thousands of years old. They've come to an alarming realization: Mussel shells are getting thinner and thinner.\n\nShells collected that are over 1,000 years old are on average 27 percent thicker than today's shells, the researchers note in new paper in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Thick shells were the norm until about the 1970s, when shells were 32 percent thicker than they are today. Then, things suddenly started to get thin fast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe unsettling cause for the thinning shells is the rapidly acidifying waters of the Pacific Ocean. Essentially, the mussels are in the process of a slow dissolve in the acid bath they now spend their lives stewing in.\n\nIf the thought of being slowly consumed from all around as you swim isn't quite horrifying enough, the researchers project that this is only the beginning of the bad news for yummy shellfish. With an ocean that's only growing more and more acidic, we could easily see mussels\u2014with their new brittle bodies\u2014die out.\n\nG/O Media may get a commission 10% off 10% off Wish A gift for literally everybody.\n\nGifts under $20, $10, and even $5.

The researchers who studied this phenomenon found that modern mussel shells are on average 27 percent thinner than shells from mussels that lived in the past, and that shells have become 32 percent thinner since the 1970s. It\u2019s believed that the rapidly acidifying waters of the Pacific Ocean are responsible for the thinning shell phenomenon, which could lead to the extinction of mussels in the future.", "Response B": "A team of researchers from the University of Chicago has warned that shell thickness in mussels pulled from the Pacific coast is decreasing rapidly. The cause of the decline is the rapidly acidifying waters of the Pacific Ocean, which are causing the mussels to dissolve. The researchers suggest that if the trend continues, mussels could become extinct."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 48}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5a52a04cacc75b000179cd4c_64b662f33391b320bcd89dd6", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "3", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "3", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "3", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 18s "}}
