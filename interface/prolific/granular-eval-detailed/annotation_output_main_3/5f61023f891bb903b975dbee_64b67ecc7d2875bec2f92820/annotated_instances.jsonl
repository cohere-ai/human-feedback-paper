The move comes as the institution continues to struggle financially.\n\nDeutsche Bank will shut down or merge 188 of its branches across Germany during 2017, the Frankfurt-based institute said on Sunday.\n\nAccording to a list published on the bank's website, North Rhine-Westphalia - Germany's most populous state - will be the most affected, with 51 branches set to be eliminated over the next year. Berlin is set to lose 43 branches, 26 of them part of Berliner Bank, Deutsche Bank's sister company.

Some 2,500 of these fall under private and corporate customer business.\n\nThe bank has also pulled out of ten foreign markets and gotten rid of its investment banking divisions.\n\nIn 2015, the institution reported a record loss of 6.8 billion euros.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Desperation for a new water supply due to droughts in California has lead the San Luis Obispo Counter Supervisors to approach the PG&E's Diablo Canyon Power Plant.  The company can produce nearly a million gallons of water a day but this has only been available for internal use so far.  The plan is to buy 60% of this hopefully non-contaminated water from PG&E, which is critically needed in the short term.
