{"id": "120", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Trapped by Hitler's soldiers during the brutal winter of 1941-42, a band of Russian botanists faced a terrible choice.\n\nFor more than a decade, workers at the Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry had been gathering seeds from all over the world and carefully preserving them in a locked vault. They believed they held the raw materials to allow scientists to breed the super plants of the future, crops that could survive anything nature could throw at them.\n\nThe Institute's founder, Nikolai Vavilov, had spent years collecting rare and wild relatives of wheat, rye and other staples so crop breeders could mine their hardy genes. Now the Nazis had laid siege to Leningrad (now St Petersburg), preventing the institute's workers from leaving the city. So the botanists barricaded themselves in with the stash, preparing to defend it from rats, freezing weather and desperately hungry citizens.\n\nLesser scientists would have eaten the precious packs of rice, wheat, peas, oats and potatoes during the 28-month siege. Instead, Dmitri S Ivanov, the head of the rice collection, a bespectacled man with fine, side-parted hair, painstakingly conserved several thousand packs of rice while gradually succumbing to malnutrition.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The team behind the Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry in Russia had collected seeds from all over the world, hoping to breed super-crops that could withstand the toughest of conditions. However, when the Nazis laid siege to the institute in 1941, workers were trapped inside with the seeds, unable to leave. The team faced the choice of either eating the seeds or starvation.", "Response B": "Botanists are trying to find rare wild seed strains that can survive our climate change before they die out so as to ensure future global food supplies. These \"seed hunters\" are particularly keen to find strains that survive in harsh, arid places so they may share genes that help crops weather our future climate. For centuries, farmers have been selecting crops that are productive, sweeter and easy to peel but at the same time sacrificing other traits, leaving us with a \"pampered offspring\" of plants; the search is on to recover the lost \"tough\" genes. Crops are increasingly vulnerable to being wiped out by a single disaster so an array of plant genes are needed to protect ourselves from future hunger."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 59}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63874670685f244f8d4e93ff_64b67db037f04a9ac5c753d4", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "1", "confidence_a": "4", "confidence_b": "1", "useful_a": "3", "useful_b": "1", "detail_a": "2", "detail_b": "1", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "2", "creativity_b": "1", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "1", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 14s "}}
