{"id": "454", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to hatch a girl chikorita in pok\u00e9mon diamond, pearl, and platinum?", "Response A": "To hatch a girl Chikorita in Pok\u00e9mon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, you need to get an Egg from a female Pok\u00e9mon. In this case, you need to get an Egg from a female Chikorita. You can get an Egg from a wild female Chikorita or by breeding a male Chikorita with a female Pok\u00e9mon that can produce an Egg. Once you have the Egg, you need to hatch it by walking around with it as your active Pok\u00e9mon. The Egg will hatch after a certain number of steps, and you will have a 50% chance of getting a female Chikorita.", "Response B": "Sure! It\u2019s actually really easy to hatch a girl chikorita. First, you need a game that allows you to trade, and a DS, DSi, or 3DS. Then, you need to make a trade with someone who has a different game, like heartgold or soulsilver, that allows you to trade."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 61}, "label_annotations": {"email": "631625a868c124694850420c_64b6703f54236612bf669790", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "4", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "1", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "3", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "Yes", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 58s "}}
