Let's start from the beginning everyone.\nCharles: What was the problem that time?\nAnna: The feeling was all wrong, Mike. She is telling you that she doesn't want to see you anymore, but I want to get more anger from you. You're acting hurt and sad, but that's not how your character would act in this situation.\nCharles: But Jason and Laura had been together for 3 years. Don't you think his reaction would be one of both anger and sadness?\nAnna: At this point, no. I think he would react the way most guys would and then later on, we would see his real feelings.\nCharles: I'm not so sure about that.\nAnna: Let's try it my way and you can see how you feel when you're saying your lines. After that, if it still doesn't feel right we can try something else.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "Anna is directing Mike, Charles and Jason in a movie scene.
