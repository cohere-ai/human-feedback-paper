{"id": "621", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Conversation:\nRachel: Have you ever thought of moving, Sarah?\nNova: We thought about it, but my husband and I can't afford it right now.\nRachel: Buying a house near our company can be expensive, but there are ways to find cheaper houses.\nNova: Like what?\nRachel: Well, you can buy a house far away from the city center. You would definitely save money that way.\nNova: That's a good idea.\nRachel: My sister in law and her husband just bought a house that way. And they're pretty satisfied with it.\nNova: Is the house in poor condition?\nRachel: Not at all, the woman who owned it bought it from her friend and took good care of it. But when she died she had no family left and no will, so the government had to sell it for her.\nNova: Was it a very old house?\nRachel: Yes, it was about 50 years old. There were a few repairs that needed doing but it didn't take a lot of money or time.\nNova: Is it in a good location?\nRachel: The area can be a bit rough in the evening but the neighbors watch out for each other so it's OK.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "Nova and her husband can't afford to buy a house right now.
