Then, fold one of the sleeves back to the middle of the shirt, making sure it's aligned. Next, fold the other sleeve back to the middle of the shirt, also making sure it's aligned. Fold the bottom of the shirt up to the middle, then fold the shirt in half. Finally, fold the sleeves over the shirt and adjust as necessary to get a neat and compact wrap."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 44}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5f6b8c1f5622370b0c94d597_64b674306ff70f0144cf1000", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "2", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "3", "detail_a": "3", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "4", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "i assume from \"wrap\" in the prompt this is the sort of \"polo\" meant, but it's not clear.
