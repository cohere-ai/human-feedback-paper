They\u2019re not hard to find, they\u2019re usually sold in stores that sell other types of cards, like gift cards or game cards.  You\u2019ll need to find one that has at least one deck that has a card with a number on it, and that number will correspond to a card in the deck.  Once you have a deck, you\u2019ll need to shuffle the cards, and then you\u2019ll need to draw one card.  Once you have a card, you\u2019ll need to look at the card and decide what you think it means.  For example, if the card says \u201cGrief\u201d, you might decide that the card means you\u2019re going to have to deal with some grief in the near future.  Once you have a card, you\u2019ll need to write down what you think the card means.  Then you\u2019ll need to repeat the process until you have a bunch of cards that have different meanings.
