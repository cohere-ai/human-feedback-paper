First you need to create a sim (or use an existing one) with the aspiration to have a baby.  Then you can use the pregnancy tester to see if she\u2019s pregnant.  When she is, you can use the baby maker to create a baby in her womb, or you can wait for her to give birth naturally.  If you use the baby maker, you can choose the gender of the baby, or leave it as a surprise!  You can also choose to have twins, or even triplets.  The baby maker also lets you control the health, personality, and other traits of the baby.  You can use it multiple times to add more babies to the same pregnancy, or you can use it on different sims to create multiple pregnancies at once.
