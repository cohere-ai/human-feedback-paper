Daugherty said the current approach of the Internet of Things around gadgetry may be good business now, but consumers have not developed a loyalty to the technologies.\n\n'Wearable consumer technologies have the highest abandonment rate of any consumer product category. That's because they're gadgets that people don't find sustainable value in,' he said. 'I'm generalizing, there are some that are good, but generally people abandon them at a rate of seven in 10 people within one year.'\n\nThe CTO pointed out that the churn around life cycles of small consumer gadgets profit businesses, 'but the customers aren't using them sustainably.'\n\nOther trends on which Accenture will focus are the 'outcome economy,' platform-driven businesses, intelligent enterprise, and the 'workforce reimagined,' he said.\n\n'There really needs to be a focus on the workforce and thinking about how the workforce works in different ways, and looking at both the policy and the corporate implications of how we can prepare the workforce to work in a new way. And a lot of this will be connected around how people interact with technology in a different way to work more effectively, work more safely,' Daugherty said.\n\nPUBLISHED JULY 13, 2015\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Accenture believes that current focus on Internet of Things has been on gadgets rather than creating better consumer experiences. The company also believes that wearable consumer technologies have high abandonment rate, which is due to these technologies being gadgets and not providing sustainable value to the consumers. Accenture will focus on four trends, namely outcome economy, platform-driven businesses, intelligent enterprise and workforce reimagined in future. The latter one focuses on technology and how it can be used to improve workforce productivity while addressing policy and corporate implications.", "Response B": "The current focus of IoT is misplaced on technology and gadget, and not where it should be - creating a better experience for consumers, according to the Chief Technology Officer of Accenture, Paul Daugherty. Speaking at MIT, he added that the reason for the high abandonment rate of wearable technology is \"because they're gadgets that people don't find sustainable value in.\""}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 54}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d1c9d39ff67e3000140ca87_64b66f7a105b7bbb2bc3eb50", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "4", "confidence_b": "3", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "3", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "3", "creativity_a": "2", "creativity_b": "1", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "no"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 56s "}}
