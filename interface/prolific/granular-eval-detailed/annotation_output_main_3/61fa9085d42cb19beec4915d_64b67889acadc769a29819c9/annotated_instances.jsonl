Daugherty said the current approach of the Internet of Things around gadgetry may be good business now, but consumers have not developed a loyalty to the technologies.\n\n'Wearable consumer technologies have the highest abandonment rate of any consumer product category. That's because they're gadgets that people don't find sustainable value in,' he said. 'I'm generalizing, there are some that are good, but generally people abandon them at a rate of seven in 10 people within one year.'\n\nThe CTO pointed out that the churn around life cycles of small consumer gadgets profit businesses, 'but the customers aren't using them sustainably.'\n\nOther trends on which Accenture will focus are the 'outcome economy,' platform-driven businesses, intelligent enterprise, and the 'workforce reimagined,' he said.\n\n'There really needs to be a focus on the workforce and thinking about how the workforce works in different ways, and looking at both the policy and the corporate implications of how we can prepare the workforce to work in a new way. And a lot of this will be connected around how people interact with technology in a different way to work more effectively, work more safely,' Daugherty said.\n\nPUBLISHED JULY 13, 2015\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Accenture's CTO Paul Daugherty took the stage at a recent event at MIT to introduce the company's take on connected technologies: the \"Internet of Me.\" According to Daugherty, the current approach of the Internet of Things around gadgetry may be good business now, but consumers have not developed a loyalty to the technologies. Hence, Accenture suggests a new approach called the \"Internet of Me,\" which is focused on creating better experiences for consumers. The company also predicts other trends on which it will focus, including the 'outcome economy,' platform-driven businesses, intelligent enterprise, and the 'workforce reimagined.'", "Response B": "The current focus of IoT is misplaced on technology and gadget, and not where it should be - creating a better experience for consumers, according to the Chief Technology Officer of Accenture, Paul Daugherty.
