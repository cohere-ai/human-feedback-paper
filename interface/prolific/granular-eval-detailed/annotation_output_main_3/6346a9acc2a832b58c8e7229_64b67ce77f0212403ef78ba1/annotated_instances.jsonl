The survey, carried out in November, revealed estimated administration cost savings of $210m, while more than three-quarters of insurers and brokers, and 91% of reinsurers said the Blockchain Insurance Industry Initiative, set to launch next year, was relevant to their business. B3i, which is developing its blockchain prototype into a market-ready product, currently has 38 insurer, reinsurer and broker members, drawn from around the world.", "Response B": "The operator of Fukushima nuclear plant has taken a \"major step forward\" by removing a 20-tonne piece of rubble from the destroyed reactor.  It has been confirmed that decommissioning of the plant could last for four decades and that compensation costs are due to be over $57 billion. Following this announcement, Japan's insurance companies stated they would push for an average 19% increase in its earthquake premiums, which are due to come into effect January 2017.  Tokyo has already given billions of dollars to the embattled company to keep it afloat whilst the mess is cleared."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_57"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6346a9acc2a832b58c8e7229_64b67ce77f0212403ef78ba1", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "4", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "2", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "4", "feedback": "Both very suitable summaries of the original text"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 37s "}}
