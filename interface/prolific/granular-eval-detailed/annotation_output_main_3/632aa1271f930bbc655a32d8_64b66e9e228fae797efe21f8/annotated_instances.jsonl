Volvo believes it will sell about 750 examples of the Polestar-tuned V60 and S60 models this year, but it predicts the number will go up to about 1,500 in the medium-term future.\n\nAlthough Volvo hasn't revealed exactly how it plans on doubling sales, persistent rumors indicate that a sport-focused version of the Golf-sized V40 hatchback is on its way. Sources close to Volvo have previously hinted the V40 Polestar could benefit from a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that will use both a turbocharger and a supercharger to generate over 300 horsepower. An automatic transmission will send power to all four wheels via a Haldex-type all-wheel drive system, the same setup found in the Golf R.\n\nInterestingly, Volvo has confirmed that it has given Polestar immediate access to its gas-electric plug-in hybrid technology. Polestar will tweak both the gasoline-burning engine and the electric motor to squeeze as much power out of the drivetrain as possible while still keeping gas mileage in check.\n\nThe Gothenburg-based automaker has made it clear that it isn't interested in following Mercedes-AMG's lead and chasing all-out volume, but it wants to gradually expand the scope of its newly acquired Polestar sub-brand.\n\n\"Driving a Volvo Polestar is a special experience. We have decided to bring this experience to more Volvo drivers, placing the full resources of Volvo behind the development of Polestar as the model name for our high-performance cars,\" said Volvo boss H\u00e5kan Samuelsson in a statement.\n\nAlthough an official time frame for when the next Polestar-tuned Volvo will land was not provided, it's safe to assume it's not going to arrive until next year at the earliest. The V40 Polestar won't be sold in the United States, but subsequent models based on either the S60, the S90 (which will soon replace the S80) or the second-gen XC90 will undoubtedly join the company's lineup on our shores.\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The Volvo S60 Polestar has a 362-horsepower engine, and this week the Swedish automaker announced that it's taking full control of the Polestar sub-brand. The additional $500 million investment will be used to help Polestar further develop its hybrid and electric drivetrains, while also expanding its sales network.\n\nThe Polestar brand will be used to develop performance Volvos, and the first model to emerge from the partnership was the S60 Polestar. The sedan's 2.0-liter twin-charged four-cylinder engine delivers 362 horsepower and 347 pound-feet of torque, and it's paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.\n\nVolvo believes that the Polestar models will be able to compete with the BMW M3, Mercedes-AMG C63, and Audi RS4.\n\nThe Polestar version of the S60 can accelerate from 0-60 mph in 4.7 seconds and hit a top speed of 155 mph.\n\nThe Polestar S60 also features upgraded brakes, \u00d6hlins dampers, and a stiffer chassis.\n\nIn addition to the Polestar S60, the company will also introduce a Polestar-tuned V60 next year.\n\nThe S60 Polestar is the first of a series of Polestar Volvos that will be sold globally in the coming years.\n\nThe Polestar V60, which is the second-generation wagon from Volvo, will have the same engine and chassis as the Polestar S60.\n\nPolestar has already begun work on a high-performance plug-in hybrid version of the Volvo XC90 SUV, which is expected to arrive in the coming years.\n\nThe $500 million investment will help Polestar develop hybrid and electric technology for Volvo models, as well as expand the company's retail network.\n\nThe Polestar brand will be used to develop performance Volvos, and the first model to emerge from the partnership was the S60 Polestar.\n\nVolvo is the latest automaker to establish a performance sub-brand, following in the footsteps of Mercedes-AMG, Audi's RS division, and BMW's M division.\n\nThe Polestar S60 has a 362-horsepower engine, and Volvo believes it will be able to compete with the BMW M3, Mercedes-AMG C63, and Audi RS4.\n\nThe", "Response B": "Volvo has announced that it has doubled the sales of Polestar-badged models in 2016, selling 1,200 Polestar models, with a predicted increase to 2,000 in 2017.
