One way to get buff is to do strength training exercises. You can use free weights, like dumbbells, or you can use a weight machine at the gym. You can also do body weight exercises like pushups, squats, and lunges. Another way to get buff is to do cardio exercises like running, swimming, or biking. You can also do strength and cardio exercises at the same time, like with high intensity interval training."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 48}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to get buff?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Decide the areas of your body that are the weakest.<br/>Set strength and aerobic goals.<br/>Write down your goals.<br/>Create a gym schedule.<br/>Learn how to do the basic body weight exercises that work more than 1 muscle group at once.<br/>Do body weight exercises 3 to 4 times per week.<br/>Do circuits of body weight exercise, giving yourself 30 seconds to rest between sets.<br/>Increase the difficulty of the exercise, by going further or holding hand weights while you do the exercise.<br/>Start with weight machines.<br/>Work short and long muscle fibers.<br/>Target muscle groups on different days.<br/>Work your target muscle groups to fatigue.<br/>Increase the weight you lift every 3 weeks.<br/>Start lifting free weights as soon you know how to do proper form.<br/>Add 20 to 30 minutes of cardio exercise 3 to 4 times per week.<br/>Try interval training.<br/>Try several cardio machines or sports.<br/>Create a meal plan that adds more protein into your diet.<br/>Restrict your consumption of refined carbohydrates.<br/>Eat more produce.<br/>Add a protein-filled snack, like a yogurt smoothie, nuts or chicken wrap after you work out.</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response B </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure!
