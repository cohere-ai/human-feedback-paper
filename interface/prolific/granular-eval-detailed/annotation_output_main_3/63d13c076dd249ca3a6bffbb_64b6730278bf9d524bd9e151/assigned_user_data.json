An angel oracle is a tool that allows you to ask an angel for guidance and receive an angelic message in response.  To use the oracle, you\u2019ll first need to clear your mind and heart of negative energy, then ask a question of the angel and wait for a response.  There are many different types of angel oracles, but a common method is to use a deck of angel oracle cards.  You can buy angel oracle cards at many New Age stores, or you can make your own by creating oracle cards with angelic images.  Once you have your cards, you can use them to do a reading by laying out the cards in a pattern and then interpreting the meaning of the cards.  To clear your mind and heart, you might want to meditate, do some deep breathing, or say a prayer.  Next, choose", "Response B": "Sure, I\u2019d be happy to help.  First, you need to find an angel card deck.  They\u2019re not hard to find, they\u2019re usually sold in stores that sell other types of cards, like gift cards or game cards.  You\u2019ll need to find one that has at least one deck that has a card with a number on it, and that number will correspond to a card in the deck.  Once you have a deck, you\u2019ll need to shuffle the cards, and then you\u2019ll need to draw one card.  Once you have a card, you\u2019ll need to look at the card and decide what you think it means.  For example, if the card says \u201cGrief\u201d, you might decide that the card means you\u2019re going to have to deal with some grief in the near future.  Once you have a card, you\u2019ll need to write down what you think the card means.  Then you\u2019ll need to repeat the process until you have a bunch of cards that have different meanings.
