Go to Flipside and take the first right, then take the first left and go through the warp pipe.  There\u2019s a? Block in the next room with a Red Shell inside.  Go back to the pit and use the shell to jump on the switches.  Then, jump on the platforms to reach the top.", "Response B": "Take 5 Emergency Rations.\nTake powerful attack items.\nIt's a good idea to be at least level 20.\nIt's a good idea to be Bowser and Carrie so you can jump and then attack.\nIn some floors, (Like 93 and 89) there are huge amounts of enemies.\nWhen it comes to Wracktail (Floor 100), use Luigi."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 46}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6149cdfabc3c34aedf3cdf90_64b67f2aa7f7b0f8e576940f", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "3", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "4", "feedback": "This was a hard one to judge factuality, but I did my best through googling."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 30s "}}
