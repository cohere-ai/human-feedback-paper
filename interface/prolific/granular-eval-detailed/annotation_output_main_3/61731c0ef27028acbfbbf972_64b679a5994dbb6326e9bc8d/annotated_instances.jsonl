Daugherty said the current approach of the Internet of Things around gadgetry may be good business now, but consumers have not developed a loyalty to the technologies.\n\n'Wearable consumer technologies have the highest abandonment rate of any consumer product category. That's because they're gadgets that people don't find sustainable value in,' he said. 'I'm generalizing, there are some that are good, but generally people abandon them at a rate of seven in 10 people within one year.'\n\nThe CTO pointed out that the churn around life cycles of small consumer gadgets profit businesses, 'but the customers aren't using them sustainably.'\n\nOther trends on which Accenture will focus are the 'outcome economy,' platform-driven businesses, intelligent enterprise, and the 'workforce reimagined,' he said.\n\n'There really needs to be a focus on the workforce and thinking about how the workforce works in different ways, and looking at both the policy and the corporate implications of how we can prepare the workforce to work in a new way. And a lot of this will be connected around how people interact with technology in a different way to work more effectively, work more safely,' Daugherty said.\n\nPUBLISHED JULY 13, 2015\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Paul Daugherty, CEO of Accenture, has told a group of executives at MIT that the current Internet of Things (IoT) approach has been \"misplaced\" and should be focused on creating better experiences for consumers. He explained that wearables and other IoT devices are often viewed as \"gizmos that people don't find sustainable value in\". The CEO also highlighted that businesses have been profitably using IoT devices for many years, but that consumers have not been willing to use them. Daugherty also pointed out that the IoT churn rate is \"high\", with a seven in ten device users abandoning it within a year.\n\nDaugherty instead argued that IoT should be viewed as an enabler, not a technology. The CEO pointed out that the IoT-enabled workforce will be more productive, efficient and safe. \"There really needs to be a focus on the workforce and thinking about how the workforce works in different ways, and looking at both the policy and the corporate implications of how we can prepare the workforce to work in a new way. And a lot of this will be connected around how people interact with technology in a different way to work more effectively, work more safely,\" Daugherty said.\n\nThe CEO also highlighted that people are already working in a more digital way. \"We're not going to stop doing that,\" he said. \"We're going to do it in different ways.\"\n\nThe technology that is being used now, and will be used in the future, is the enabler, and the way that people work is the \"commodity\", according to Daugherty. The CEO also highlighted that the IoT will be a force for good, by making people's lives more efficient and allowing them to work in new ways. \"It will be a force for good,\" he said. \"I think the IoT will be a force for good, but we're not there yet.\"", "Response B": "- Paul Daugherty, Chief Technology Officer of Accenture, has launched a new Internet of Things concept, the \"Internet of Me\".\n- The new approach is based around personalisation, and sees digital services tailored to individual users.\n- Daugherty believes that current Internet of Things technology is based too heavily on gadgets and technology, rather than on creating improved user experiences.\n- The Internet of Me approach is intended to develop a more sustainable and long-term use of connected technology."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 54}, "label_annotations": {"email": "61731c0ef27028acbfbbf972_64b679a5994dbb6326e9bc8d", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "3", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "3", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "3", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "1", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "1", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "no"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 30s "}}
