{"id": "302", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to maintain good credit?", "Response A": "Sure, I\u2019d be happy to.  First, let me explain a little about what credit is, and what it\u2019s used for.  When you buy something on credit, you\u2019re borrowing money from a bank or other lender, and agreeing to pay it back later.  So, when you borrow money, you\u2019re building up a credit history, which is a record of how you\u2019ve borrowed money in the past, and how you\u2019ve paid it back.  Credit history is important because it gives a sense of how responsible you are with money, and how likely you are to pay back any money you borrow in the future.  When you have a good credit history, you\u2019re a good credit risk, and banks and other lenders will be more likely to lend you money in the future.", "Response B": "There are several ways to maintain good credit. First, always pay your bills on time. This shows lenders that you are responsible and can be trusted. Second, keep your credit utilization low. This means using a small percentage of your available credit at any given time. Third, avoid opening too many new accounts at once. Finally, monitor your credit report regularly to ensure that there are no errors or fraudulent activity."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 51}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5f105b47d36c8701ec112317_64b676d306ec3f6146c3eb64", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "3", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "3", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "1", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "Yes, this response waffled on slightly making it less helpful ", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 21s "}}
