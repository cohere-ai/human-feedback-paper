{"id": "571", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Google will now scan your emails for information relevant to advertising just a bit slower thanks to a settlement of a case pending in a Northern California district court. The system will now scan those emails after they're available in the recipient's Gmail mailbox, in contrast to Google's prior practice, where the email was scanned during the delivery process.\n\nSince each email message is scanned to deliver more relevant ads, the process meant that non-Gmail accounts were indirectly being cataloged as well. The plaintiffs in the case, which was styled Matera vs. Google, argued that this was a violation of both the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the California Information Privacy Act, calling the strategy \"the twenty-first-century equivalent of AT&T eavesdropping on each of its customers' phone conversations, or of the postal service taking information from private correspondence.\"\n\nInstead of fight the case, Google agreed to change how it scans these emails \u2014 although scans for spam and malware would still occur during the delivery process as occurred before. The change will be seamless to customers, as it literally is a matter of milliseconds in processing time.\n\nIt's not clear whether Google was receiving any material benefit from the strategy \u2014 i.e. data from those non-Gmail users being used to serve more relevant ads across Google's widespread ad network. It also agreed to pay any legal costs related to the case and make a one-time payment of $2,000 to each of the class representatives.\n\nOther ad providers have not been so lucky. Yahoo was forced to settle over similar issues with its email-related ad-targeting practices, but ended up paying close to twice what Google had to in legal costs (about $4 million).\n\nGoogle declined to comment on the settlement, but offered that its efforts would result in concrete technical changes. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not respond to a request for comment as of press time.\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "British telecommunications firm Vodafone is set to join forces with India's Ideal Cellular, taking a 45% stake in the new business, which will have nearly 400 million customers. The deal is aimed at increasing Vodafone and Ideal Cellular's reach in India's telecom market, which is renowned for being particularly fierce.", "Response B": "Google is to change the way it scans emails after settling a case in a northern California district court. Emails will now be scanned once they are in the recipient's Gmail inbox rather than during the delivery process. The previous method meant that non-Gmail accounts were being catalogued as well, which led the plaintiffs in Matera vs. Google to argue that this violated privacy laws. Google agreed to change its scanning process rather than fight the case. It is not clear whether the company benefited materially from its original scanning process."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": "distractor_61"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5ee5defbfe74a3000d106f51_64b66b6d8f407a1cb53447ab", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "1", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "1", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "1", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "1", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "1", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "1", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "Yes", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "Yes", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "The response is totally different from the actual request", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 24s "}}
