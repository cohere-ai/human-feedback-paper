{"id": "594", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to avoid confusing a dog during training?", "Response A": "It\u2019s a good idea to avoid sudden movements and loud noises around dogs, since these can startle or frighten them and make it harder for them to learn.  You can also try to keep a calm, gentle demeanor, speak in a soft voice, and offer treats or praise for good behavior.  Other helpful strategies include practicing training in a quiet, distraction-free environment, using hand signals in addition to verbal commands, and gradually introducing new commands or behaviors.  Overall, training a dog requires patience, positive reinforcement, and consistency, so it\u2019s important to take your time and avoid confusing or frightening the dog during training sessions.", "Response B": "To avoid confusing a dog during training, it is important to use clear and consistent commands. Avoid using multiple words or gestures for the same command. Use positive reinforcement to reward good behavior and avoid punishment or negative reinforcement for bad behavior. Also, be patient and consistent in your training sessions to ensure your dog understands what you are asking them to do."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 59}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5f105b47d36c8701ec112317_64b66a898266d4a290fe21e6", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 49s "}}
