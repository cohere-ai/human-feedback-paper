Once inside, you can find the elevator that will take you to the top of the pit. You will then need to fight a boss before you can continue on to the next area.", "Response B": "Sure, here\u2019s how:\n\nTo start, you need to get a red shell.  Go to Flipside and take the first right, then take the first left and go through the warp pipe.  There\u2019s a? Block in the next room with a Red Shell inside.  Go back to the pit and use the shell to jump on the switches.  Then, jump on the platforms to reach the top."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 46}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to beat the flipside pit in super paper mario?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            To beat the Flipside Pit in Super Paper Mario, you need to flip back to the normal world and find the hidden door in Area 1.
