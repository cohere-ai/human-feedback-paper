{"id": "954", "input_text": {"Prompt": "KUALA LUMPUR (March 8): CIMB Group Holdings Bhd and GHL Systems Bhd have teamed up to provide card payment services for CIMB's corporate clients in Thailand's retail and services segments.\n\nThe joint effort will be undertaken through their Thai subsidiaries, CIMB Thai Bank Ltd Bhd and GHL (Thailand) Co Ltd.\n\n\"It will enable CIMB Thai's merchants to accept credit card payment services at their premises and online transactions with GHL being the exclusive partner to service and manage these merchants,\" GHL said in a statement today.\n\nGHL said there is an estimated 400,000 electronic data capture (EDC) and point of sale (POS) terminals servicing 22 million credit cards and 48 million debit cards issued in Thailand.\n\nBoth GHL and CIMB Thai aim to sign up more merchants to provide alternative payment solutions rather than traditional cash payments.\n\nIt falls in line with Bank of Thailand's set target of two million new acceptance points to encourage the move from cash to electronic payments.\n\nCIMB Thai president and chief executive officer Kittiphun Anutarasoti said the partnership allows the bank to offer a complete and comprehensive cash management solution to expand its customer base.\n\nHe added that it would promote a cashless society through an alternative payment solution and reduce operation overheads for small-medium enterprises and large corporate clients.\n\nGHL group chief executive officer Danny Leong said the deal enables the company to leverage on its strengths and advantages.\n\n\"Thailand, like most of Asean, has an enormous small merchant segment and high street retail stores outside Bangkok that remain untapped for payments,\" Leong added.\n\nCIMB's share price closed down eight sen or 1.47% at RM5.37, valuing the group at RM47.6 billion, while GHL dipped one sen or 0.91% to close at RM1.09 for a market capitalisation of RM712.1 million.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "CIMB Group Holdings Bhd and GHL Systems Bhd have teamed up to provide card payment services for CIMB's corporate clients in Thailand's retail and services segments.", "Response B": "GHL Systems and CIMB Group Holdings have teamed up to provide card payment services for CIMB's corporate clients in Thailand's retail and services segments."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 50}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5a52a04cacc75b000179cd4c_64b6587a560d55629ed13736", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 31s "}}
