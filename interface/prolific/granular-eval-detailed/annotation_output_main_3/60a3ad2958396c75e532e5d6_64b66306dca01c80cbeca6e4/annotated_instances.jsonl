But she says it's her favorite subject.\nBen: Yes, I know, and her second favorite subject is math.\nAlice: Math is my worst. I don't like it. I always get the answers wrong.\nBen: So if English is your favorite subject, what's your second favorite?\nAlice: PE. What about you?\nBen: I'm not sure. Both Chinese and science are my favorite subjects. I think I like Chinese a little more than science.\nAlice: You are very different from Nancy.
