{"id": "666", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Conversation:\nAnna: OK, that's a cut. Let's start from the beginning everyone.\nCharles: What was the problem that time?\nAnna: The feeling was all wrong, Mike. She is telling you that she doesn't want to see you anymore, but I want to get more anger from you. You're acting hurt and sad, but that's not how your character would act in this situation.\nCharles: But Jason and Laura had been together for 3 years. Don't you think his reaction would be one of both anger and sadness?\nAnna: At this point, no. I think he would react the way most guys would and then later on, we would see his real feelings.\nCharles: I'm not so sure about that.\nAnna: Let's try it my way and you can see how you feel when you're saying your lines. After that, if it still doesn't feel right we can try something else.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "Anna tells Mike how to feel and act during the scene because she thinks his interpretation is wrong. Charles disagrees. Anna asks everyone to start from the beginning and try her way.", "Response B": "Anna and Charles are discussing how to respond to a person's statement that they don't want to see someone anymore. Anna believes that the person would want to see their reaction, and would expect that their character would act the way most guys would in that situation. Charles is unsure about this. They decide to try out different reactions and see how it feels."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "dialogsum", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 49}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5f6b8c1f5622370b0c94d597_64b667a195f6daca52f595f0", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "3", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "3", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "3", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "Yes", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "poorly written response, hard to make sense of"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 42s "}}
