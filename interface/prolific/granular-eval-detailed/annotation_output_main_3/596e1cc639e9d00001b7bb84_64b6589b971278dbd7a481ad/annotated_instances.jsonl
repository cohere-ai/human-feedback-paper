{"id": "95", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to avoid confusing a dog during training?", "Response A": "Start small.\nSet a schedule.\nKeep training sessions brief but productive.\nChange up your training location.\nIncorporate distractions into your training.\nReinforce positive behavior through treats and praise.\nReward your dog at the right time.\nUse clear verbal commands.\nKeep your dog motivated.\nMaintain consistent boundaries.\nDon\u2019t punish your dog physically or verbally.\nStop when your dog gets confused.", "Response B": "It\u2019s a good idea to avoid sudden movements and loud noises around dogs, since these can startle or frighten them and make it harder for them to learn.  You can also try to keep a calm, gentle demeanor, speak in a soft voice, and offer treats or praise for good behavior.  Other helpful strategies include practicing training in a quiet, distraction-free environment, using hand signals in addition to verbal commands, and gradually introducing new commands or behaviors.  Overall, training a dog requires patience, positive reinforcement, and consistency, so it\u2019s important to take your time and avoid confusing or frightening the dog during training sessions."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 59}, "label_annotations": {"email": "596e1cc639e9d00001b7bb84_64b6589b971278dbd7a481ad", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "3", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "3", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "4", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "no", "feedback": "no none"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 7m 16s "}}
