There are a few things that are really important to keep in mind.  First, you should really think about the kind of people you\u2019re serving.  It\u2019s not just about the food, but also the setting, the mood, and the company.  If you\u2019re serving at a dinner party, it\u2019s usually better to keep things a little more casual.  That said, you should still make sure that the food is good quality and delicious.  It\u2019s also important to make sure that everyone is having a good time.
