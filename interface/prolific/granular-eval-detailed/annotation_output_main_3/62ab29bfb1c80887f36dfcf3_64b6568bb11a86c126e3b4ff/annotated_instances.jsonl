One way is to establish a good relationship with media contacts by sending them press releases, pitching story ideas, and keeping them updated on your agency's work. It's also important to be transparent and honest in your interactions with them. Another way is to provide valuable content that journalists can use in their stories, such as case studies or data-driven insights. You can also leverage social media to connect with journalists and share your agency's work with a wider audience. Finally, it's important to have a clear and consistent messaging strategy that aligns with your agency's mission and values, and to be responsive to media inquiries in a timely manner.", "Response B": "Sure, I\u2019m happy to help.
