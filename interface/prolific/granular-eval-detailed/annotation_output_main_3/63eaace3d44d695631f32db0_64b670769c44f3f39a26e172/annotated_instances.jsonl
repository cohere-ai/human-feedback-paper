{"id": "447", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Conversation:\nJack: Hello. Welcome to this week's People You Meet. Today, we present to you Mark Leach, an information officer in London.\nWilliam: Hi everyone, my name's Mark Leach. I'm an information officer at the Britain Business Center, which is a tourist office for the British tourist board in London. Here, we offer a tourist information service to mainly visitors from overseas. And each year, we have about 500,000 people come to the office.\nJack: Wow. That's a large number of people. How do you manage to meet the needs of so many people?\nWilliam: I'm in charge of an information team. The team has about 10 officers who give tourist information directly over the counter to visitors. We speak a total of 13 languages altogether.\nJack: That's pretty cool. So what exactly do you do everyday?\nWilliam: Well, we act as a one stop shop for anyone who wants to come in. So it could be that they want a day trip from London, which is a very popular request. And we can offer suggestions of where to go and how to get there. If people want a two week tour of Britain, we can plan out exactly where to visit, what roads to take.\nJack: So, do you have any suggestions for people coming to Britain?\nWilliam: A good suggestion is to see as much as you can. But try to come back again and again to see different parts of the country, because in that way you really experience it.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "William introduces himself as Mark Leach, an information officer at the Britain Business Center.
