First, you should really think about the kind of people you\u2019re serving.  It\u2019s not just about the food, but also the setting, the mood, and the company.  If you\u2019re serving at a dinner party, it\u2019s usually better to keep things a little more casual.  That said, you should still make sure that the food is good quality and delicious.  It\u2019s also important to make sure that everyone is having a good time.  If you\u2019re serving at a dinner party, it\u2019s usually better to keep things a little more casual.
