You can choose to have one main color or multiple colors. Once you have the color scheme chosen, make sure the walls are cleaned and primed before painting. You may also want to consider painting the ceiling a different color or adding a border around the room. Don't forget to protect the floors and furniture before painting. Lastly, have fun and be creative with the design!", "Response B": "Sure!  First, you need to paint the walls and ceiling, then you can paint the furniture and decorate the room.  Here are some tips:\n\n- Pick a color that you like, and make sure it looks good with the furniture and other decorations in the room.\n\n- Use a paintbrush to apply the paint to the walls and ceiling, and a roller to apply it to the furniture and other decorations.\n\n- Allow the paint to dry completely before moving the furniture and other decorations back into the room.\n\n- Enjoy your new paint job!"}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 58}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to paint a girl's bedroom?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            To paint a girl's bedroom, start by selecting the color scheme that your daughter likes.
