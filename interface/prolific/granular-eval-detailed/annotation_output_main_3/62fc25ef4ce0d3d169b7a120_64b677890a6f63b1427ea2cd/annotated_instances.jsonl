I can tell you how to wrap them, and I can tell you how to make them.", "Response B": "To wrap a polo, first lay it flat on a surface. Then, fold one of the sleeves back to the middle of the shirt, making sure it's aligned. Next, fold the other sleeve back to the middle of the shirt, also making sure it's aligned. Fold the bottom of the shirt up to the middle, then fold the shirt in half. Finally, fold the sleeves over the shirt and adjust as necessary to get a neat and compact wrap."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 44}, "label_annotations": {"email": "62fc25ef4ce0d3d169b7a120_64b677890a6f63b1427ea2cd", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "1", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "1", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "1", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "1", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "1", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "1", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "Yes", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "No, I did not.", "factors_b": "No, I did not.", "feedback": "Response A is not helpful at all and the prompt did not ask to be told how to make a Polo shirt.
