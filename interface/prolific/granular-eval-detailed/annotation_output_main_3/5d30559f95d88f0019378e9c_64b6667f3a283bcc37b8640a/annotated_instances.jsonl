{"id": "690", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to paint a girl's bedroom?", "Response A": "To paint a girl's bedroom, start by selecting the color scheme that your daughter likes. You can choose to have one main color or multiple colors. Once you have the color scheme chosen, make sure the walls are cleaned and primed before painting. You may also want to consider painting the ceiling a different color or adding a border around the room. Don't forget to protect the floors and furniture before painting. Lastly, have fun and be creative with the design!", "Response B": "Sure! You could paint the walls a light pink or purple, and you might want to paint a mural of flowers or the sky on one wall.  You could also buy some cute wall decor, like a clock or a painting, and paint them to match the walls.  And you might want to paint the furniture white or a light color.  If you want to paint a design on the floor, you could use a stencil or paint a pattern freehand."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 58}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d30559f95d88f0019378e9c_64b6667f3a283bcc37b8640a", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "2", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "2", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "2", "creativity_b": "4", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 53s "}}
