{"id": "263", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to clean a computer monitor?", "Response A": "To clean a computer monitor, first turn it off and unplug it. Then, use a microfiber cloth or a soft, lint-free cloth to gently wipe the screen. Avoid using paper towels, which can scratch the surface. If there are fingerprints or smudges that won't come off, you can use a mixture of water and isopropyl alcohol (in equal parts) to clean the screen. Apply the solution to the cloth, not the screen directly, and gently wipe the screen. Finally, dry the screen with a microfiber cloth to avoid water spots.", "Response B": "The best way to clean a computer monitor is to use a soft, damp cloth to wipe it gently. Avoid using harsh chemicals, as these can damage the screen. You can also use a special cleaning solution designed for computer monitors, which is available at most stores."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 50}, "label_annotations": {"email": "631625a868c124694850420c_64b67855b08e677251b8ef6b", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "4", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 41s "}}
