That's my favorite subject.\nBen: That's because you always find it so easy. I find it very difficult so I don't like it much.\nAlice: Nancy finds English quite difficult too. But she says it's her favorite subject.\nBen: Yes, I know, and her second favorite subject is math.\nAlice: Math is my worst. I don't like it. I always get the answers wrong.\nBen: So if English is your favorite subject, what's your second favorite?\nAlice: PE. What about you?\nBen: I'm not sure. Both Chinese and science are my favorite subjects. I think I like Chinese a little more than science.\nAlice: You are very different from Nancy. She doesn't like science at all.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "Lin Fang and Lucy are talking about their favourite subjects.", "Response B": "Alice and Lin Fang are talking about the next lesson, which is English.
