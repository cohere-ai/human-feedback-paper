{"id": "543", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to wrap polos?", "Response A": "To wrap a polo, first lay it flat on a surface. Then, fold one of the sleeves back to the middle of the shirt, making sure it's aligned. Next, fold the other sleeve back to the middle of the shirt, also making sure it's aligned. Fold the bottom of the shirt up to the middle, then fold the shirt in half. Finally, fold the sleeves over the shirt and adjust as necessary to get a neat and compact wrap.", "Response B": "Sure! To wrap polos, here are the steps:\n\n1.  Cut a piece of fabric large enough to wrap around the polo and long enough to extend past the polo by a few inches.\n\n2.  Fold the fabric in half lengthwise to create two layers.\n\n3.  Place the polo in the center of the fabric, with the top of the polo aligned with the fold.\n\n4.  Bring the bottom edge of the fabric up to the top of the polo.\n\n5.  Wrap the fabric around the polo, folding the excess fabric underneath as you go.\n\n6.  When you reach the top of the polo, tuck the excess fabric inside the fold.\n\n7.  To finish, use a needle and thread to sew the fabric closed along the top of the polo."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 44}, "label_annotations": {"email": "59dc458f77860e000151240e_64b66ca4e4f5a207dd038a0d", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "2", "style_b": "2", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "3", "useful_b": "3", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "3", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "Yes", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "2", "factors_a": "The most common search result for 'wrapping a polo' is a protective fabric that goes over a horse's leg, similar to leg warmers.

It also has instructions that seem correct, but it asks you to do fold the sleeves in a later step when they should be folded and tucked away after the first steps.", "factors_b": "The most common search result for 'wrapping a polo' is a protective fabric that goes over a horse's leg, similar to leg warmers. This response seems to be just telling the person how to wrap some unknown object that's called a \"polo\".  While this isn't incorrect, it's certainly not the ideal response, and it's also strange that it has the person wrap the object in fabric and then sew it up when wrapping paper and tape would be a more intuitive option to wrap some unknown object."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 8m 40s "}}
