Consequently, the KOSPI200 Index plunged 2.8 percent, according to local reports.\n\nThe court spokesman confirmed the reports, saying investors who bought a put option for the stocks earned big but those with a call option suffered hefty losses.\n\nWith a put option contract worth 1.6 billion won, the Deutsche firm enjoyed an investment gain of 44.8 billion won, according to the reports.\n\nDeutsche Bank Korea spokeswoman Kang So-young declined to comment. Deutsche Securities Korea could not be reached for comment.\n\nPrior to the ruling, Korean prosecutors indicted three foreign employees at Deutsche Bank's Hong Kong branch on charges of their involvement in the so-called Nov. 11 Option Shock case. The German companies and affected financial companies have accepted the court ruling without any legal disputes, the reports said.\n\nThere are more financial firms who have reportedly filed a suit against the two Deutsche units on the same charges.\n\nCompanies including Hana Financial Investment and Hyundai Wise Asset Management also took the matter to court to claim damages worth a total 89.8 billion won. A court ruling on the suit is due out on Jan. 21. Hyundai Wise Asset Management reportedly argued it had nearly 90 billion in losses in the Nov. 11 incident, as it was one of the call option investors, the reports said.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The Seoul Central District Court has ordered Deutsche Bank Korea and Deutsche Securities Korea to pay 28 billion won ($25 million) in compensation to five Korean financial firms for unfair trading practices carried out five years ago.

The Korean firms had suffered heavy losses due to the unfair trading practices. The Nov. 11, 2010 unfair trading practices, known as the \"Nov. 11 Option Shock case\", involved Deutsche Bank selling large amounts of stocks just before the market closed, which led to a sharp decline in the market. Three employees of Deutsche Bank's Hong Kong branch were indicted by Korean prosecutors for their involvement in the case. The case was settled without legal disputes between the German companies and the affected Korean financial firms. Other Korean financial firms are reported to have filed suit against the two Deutsche units on the same charges, and those cases are pending."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 18}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6152152ee63e3fcd81cc961f_64b1c8d8720a02f4513b57f9", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "4", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "4", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 2s "}}
