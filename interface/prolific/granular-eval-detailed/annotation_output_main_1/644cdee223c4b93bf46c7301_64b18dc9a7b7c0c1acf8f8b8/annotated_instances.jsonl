The water has been used exclusively for plant operations but could be used to help the drought-stricken areas. The plan is to buy the extra 60 percent of water from PG&E and construct a pipeline to transport it to the front gate. The first priority areas would be the South County basins and Los Osos, with the ultimate goal of expanding the desal plant to be able to sell the water to neighboring counties.

The plant, which was built in 1990 and has been operating for 30 years, produces drinkable water for use in the power plant and is the only new water source in the county. The county has plans to buy the water on a long-term basis, with the first priority being to supply water to the South County basins and the Los Osos area. The county estimates that the project will cost between $10m and $20m, and that it will take between six months and a year to get the water to the front gate of the plant."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 12}, "label_annotations": {"email": "644cdee223c4b93bf46c7301_64b18dc9a7b7c0c1acf8f8b8", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "YES", "factors_b": "YES", "feedback": "GOOD STUDY"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 32s "}}
