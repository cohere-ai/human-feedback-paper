It is calculated by dividing the company's total assets by its total liabilities.\n\nThe asset to debt ratio is a measure of the company's financial leverage. A high asset to debt ratio can indicate that the company is using too much debt to finance its operations, which can be risky. A low asset to debt ratio can indicate that the company is using too little debt to finance its operations, which can be conservative.\n\nThere are a few different ways to calculate the asset to debt ratio. The most common method is to use the following formula:\n\nAsset to debt ratio = Total assets / Total liabilities\n\nAnother method is to use the following formula:\n\nAsset to debt ratio = Net worth / Total liabilities\n\nIn both formulas, \"total assets\" refers to the total value of all the assets owned by the company, including both tangible and intangible assets. \"Total liabilities\" refers to the total value of all the liabilities owed by the company, including both short-term and long-term liabilities. \"Net worth\" refers to the total value of all the equity owned by the company.\n\nThe asset to debt ratio is typically expressed as a percentage. A high asset to debt ratio can indicate that the company is using too much debt to finance its operations, while a low asset to debt ratio can indicate that the company is using too little debt to finance its operations."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 14}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5f6e2f793c9b1032dbe72def_64b17d1957e4026f2e3b57ee", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "1", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "3", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "2", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "1", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "3", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "2", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "Yes", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 6m 23s "}}
