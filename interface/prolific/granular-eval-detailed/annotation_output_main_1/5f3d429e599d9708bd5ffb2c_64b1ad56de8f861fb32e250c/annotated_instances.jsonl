{"id": "283", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to reach level 99 in castlevania dawn of sorrow?", "Response A": "To reach level 99 in Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow, you need to complete the game multiple times to accumulate experience points, and also equip a high-level soul to boost your character's experience gain. Additionally, you can level up faster by using the Dark Aura soul, which increases the amount of experience gained from defeated enemies. Another strategy is to fight enemies with weaker souls equipped, as they will give out more experience points when defeated.", "Response B": "Sure, to reach level 99 in Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, you need to complete all of the game's main quests, including the final boss fight.  This will take a lot of time and effort, but it's definitely possible!  You'll also need to collect a lot of experience points along the way, which you can do by defeating enemies and completing side quests."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 17}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5f3d429e599d9708bd5ffb2c_64b1ad56de8f861fb32e250c", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "4", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 15s "}}
