{"id": "562", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to spot and avoid secondhand stress?", "Response A": "Secondhand stress can be difficult to spot and avoid. However, there are some common signs that you may be experiencing it. These include feeling tired or exhausted, mood swings, irritability, anxiety, and changes in appetite or sleep patterns. To avoid secondhand stress, it is important to take care of your own mental health and wellbeing. This can include practicing relaxation techniques, setting boundaries, and seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist.", "Response B": "Sure, that sounds like a great question.  So, secondhand stress is when you\u2019re affected by the stress of someone else, without actually feeling it yourself.  For example, maybe you have a friend who is always really stressed out, and you feel that stress too.  How do you avoid that?"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 23}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5f3d429e599d9708bd5ffb2c_64b1948749aa2270c81c1344", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "3", "confidence_a": "4", "confidence_b": "2", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "2", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "2", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "3", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "2", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "2"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 15s "}}
