First, you\u2019ll need to decide what type of sewing you want to do, and what you want to make.  You could start by sewing clothing, or by making custom jewelry.  Once you\u2019ve decided on a niche, you\u2019ll need to decide how you want to sell your creations.  You could start a Etsy shop, or you could sell them at a local craft show.  After that, you\u2019ll need to find a place to work.  You could set up a room in your home, or you could work at a local sewing studio.  Once you\u2019ve found a place to work, you\u2019ll need to start creating your products.  You\u2019ll need to find patterns, or you could create your own patterns.  You\u2019ll also need to start creating your products.  You\u2019ll need to decide what materials you\u2019ll use, and how you\u2019ll make your products.

First, you\u2019ll need to create a sewing pattern.  You can do this by drawing your design on paper, or using computer-aided design (CAD) software.  Then you\u2019ll need to make a prototype of your design, so you can test it and make sure it works correctly.  Next, you\u2019ll need to create a production version of your design, and make a few samples to show potential customers.  Finally, you\u2019ll need to set up a website and marketing materials to promote your business.
