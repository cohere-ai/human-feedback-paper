I\u2019m not a scientist, and I don\u2019t have the right skills to make fireworks.", "Response B": "Sure!  In order to make fireworks, you will need some combustible materials, such as black powder or other types of explosive chemicals.  You will also need some sort of container to hold the materials, as well as some sort of fuse or igniter to set off the explosion.  Once you have gathered these materials, you can create your own fireworks by mixing the chemicals, placing them in the container, and then igniting the fuse.  Different types of fireworks produce various colors and effects, so you can experiment with different chemical combinations to create your desired effects.  Safety precautions are very important when handling explosive materials, so be sure to follow any applicable laws and safety guidelines when creating your fireworks."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 15}, "label_annotations": {"email": "641ecfa9f83175a3d9f63636_64b1b9376a10e24afc2dbd85", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "1", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "1", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "1", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "1", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "1", "clarity_b": "3", "creativity_a": "1", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "Yes", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "No other factors.", "factors_b": "No other factors."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 4s "}}
