The plant produces about 1 million gallons of water a day, and the county would like to buy the extra 60 percent that is not used at the power plant. The first priority areas for the extra water would be the South County basins, followed by Los Osos.

The water has been used exclusively for plant operations but could be used to help the drought-stricken areas. The plan is to buy the extra 60 percent of water from PG&E and construct a pipeline to transport it to the front gate.
