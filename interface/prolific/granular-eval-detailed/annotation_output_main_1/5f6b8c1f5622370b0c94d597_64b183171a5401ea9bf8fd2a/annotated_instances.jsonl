{"id": "764", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to calculate asset to debt ratio?", "Response A": "The asset to debt ratio is a financial metric used to determine how well a company is managing its finances. It is calculated by dividing the company's total assets by its total liabilities.\n\nThe asset to debt ratio is a measure of the company's financial leverage. A high asset to debt ratio can indicate that the company is using too much debt to finance its operations, which can be risky. A low asset to debt ratio can indicate that the company is using too little debt to finance its operations, which can be conservative.\n\nThere are a few different ways to calculate the asset to debt ratio. The most common method is to use the following formula:\n\nAsset to debt ratio = Total assets / Total liabilities\n\nAnother method is to use the following formula:\n\nAsset to debt ratio = Net worth / Total liabilities\n\nIn both formulas, \"total assets\" refers to the total value of all the assets owned by the company, including both tangible and intangible assets. \"Total liabilities\" refers to the total value of all the liabilities owed by the company, including both short-term and long-term liabilities. \"Net worth\" refers to the total value of all the equity owned by the company.\n\nThe asset to debt ratio is typically expressed as a percentage. A high asset to debt ratio can indicate that the company is using too much debt to finance its operations, while a low asset to debt ratio can indicate that the company is using too little debt to finance its operations.", "Response B": "Certainly! The asset to debt ratio is a financial metric used to measure the relationship between a company's assets and its debts.  To calculate the ratio, you first need to determine the company's total assets and total debts.  Then, you divide the company's total assets by its total debts to get the asset to debt ratio.  A higher asset to debt ratio indicates that a company has a healthier financial position, since it has more assets to use to pay off its debts."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 14}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5f6b8c1f5622370b0c94d597_64b183171a5401ea9bf8fd2a", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "2", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "4", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "extremely long response that takes too long to answer the question", "factors_b": "no"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 11m 23s "}}
