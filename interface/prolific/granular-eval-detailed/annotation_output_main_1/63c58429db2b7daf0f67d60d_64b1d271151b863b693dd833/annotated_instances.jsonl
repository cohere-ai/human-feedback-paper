The fear is that servicing debt burdens will lead to less household spending, companies will cut investment further and exports will continue to fall, resulting in weaker jobless growth for the economy. Without effective policy tools to steer the country out of the situation, the country's central bank and government are left to wait to see how US monetary policy develops under the incoming Trump administration."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 19}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63c58429db2b7daf0f67d60d_64b1d271151b863b693dd833", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "1", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "Yes", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "2", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "Response A just basically repeats the prompt", "factors_b": "Response B is shorter but covers the main points."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 4s "}}
