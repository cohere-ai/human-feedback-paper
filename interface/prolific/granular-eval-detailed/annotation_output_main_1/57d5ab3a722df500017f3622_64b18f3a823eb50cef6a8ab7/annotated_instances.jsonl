{"id": "627", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make fireworks?", "Response A": "Sure!  In order to make fireworks, you will need some combustible materials, such as black powder or other types of explosive chemicals.  You will also need some sort of container to hold the materials, as well as some sort of fuse or igniter to set off the explosion.  Once you have gathered these materials, you can create your own fireworks by mixing the chemicals, placing them in the container, and then igniting the fuse.  Different types of fireworks produce various colors and effects, so you can experiment with different chemical combinations to create your desired effects.  Safety precautions are very important when handling explosive materials, so be sure to follow any applicable laws and safety guidelines when creating your fireworks.", "Response B": "Punch a hole near the bottom of an empty can.\nInsert a 4-inch fuse into the hole at the bottom of the can.\nPut in black or smokeless powder.\nCover the hole with a disc-shaped piece of tissue paper.\nGently fill 1/2 to 2/3 of the can with flammable powder.\nLight the fuse, and run back 30\u201350 feet (9.1\u201315.2\u00a0m)."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 15}, "label_annotations": {"email": "57d5ab3a722df500017f3622_64b18f3a823eb50cef6a8ab7", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "3", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "2", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "2", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 24s "}}
