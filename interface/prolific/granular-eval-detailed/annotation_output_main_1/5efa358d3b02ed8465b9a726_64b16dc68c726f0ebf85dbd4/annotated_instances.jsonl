Presumably, the addition of thermal-imaging capabilities to its higher-end drones is meant to lock down that market, not make it easier to hunt and kill humans. Presumably.\n\nDJI has partenered up with thermal-imaging manufacturer FLIR to produce the Zenmuse XT, a thermal-imaging camera that will integrate onto the gimbal on DJI's existing Inspire 1 and Matrice 100 drones. That means all the advantages that DJI has become famous for\u2014stupid-simple operation, live-streaming first-person video and good performance\u2014will transfer over to a thermal-imaging platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn turn, that should open new kinds of possibilities for users. Sure, it would be fun to blast around with a thermal-imaging camera as a hobby; but for search-and-rescue, firefighting or construction workers, it could add a genuinely game-changing capability.\n\nThere's no word on price, but the existing Zenmuse X5 camera already costs thousands of dollars, and thermal-imaging cameras are not normally synonymous with 'cheap'. Wait and see how many organs you'll have to sell off: availability is expected in the first part of 2016.\n\nG/O Media may get a commission 10% off 10% off Wish A gift for literally everybody.\n\nGifts under $20, $10, and even $5.
