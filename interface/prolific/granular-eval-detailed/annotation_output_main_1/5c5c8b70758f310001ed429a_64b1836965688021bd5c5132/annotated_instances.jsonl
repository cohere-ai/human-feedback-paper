{"id": "761", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to give a horse an injection?", "Response A": "Sure, I can do that.  First you have to figure out where you\u2019re going to give the injection, and how to hold the horse.  For example, if you\u2019re going to give the injection in the neck, you might need to tie the horse down.  You might also need to figure out how to hold the horse\u2019s head still, so you can give the injection in the right spot.  Once you have the horse secured, you can give the injection.  You\u2019ll want to be sure you have the right amount of medication, and that you\u2019re giving it to the right spot.  You might want to make sure the horse is calm, and not stressed out.  Once you have the injection ready, you can give it to the horse.  Make sure you follow the instructions carefully, so you don\u2019t give the horse too much medication, or too little.  You\u2019ll also want to make sure you\u2019re giving it in the right spot, and you\u2019re not doing anything that might hurt the horse.  Once you have the injection done, you can release the horse, and make sure it\u2019s okay.", "Response B": "Ask an experienced horse person to help out.If you're reading this article, you likely don't have a lot of experience with giving injections.\nHave a professional inject a needle-shy horse.\nAsk your vet about safety precautions.To be safe, you should know whether the medication would be dangerous to you if you accidentally injected some into yourself.\nUse a brand new needle for each injection.\nUnderstand how to give an intramuscular (IM) injection.This is the most common injection method, during which the needle passes through the skin into the muscle underneath.\nDecide where on the horse to give the injection.\nPut yourself a safe position.\nCalm the horse.\nUnderstand why many people prefer giving injections in the neck.\nFamiliarize yourself with the anatomy of the injection site.\nPinpoint the ideal injection spot.\nKnow the advantages and disadvantages of a hindquarters injection.\nGet to know the anatomy of the hindquarters.\nLocate the ideal injection site.\nAvoid injecting into the top of the rump.The top of the rump/buttocks used to be a popular injection site because you can stand further forward, out of reach of kicking legs.\nDo not \"tap\" the horse at the injection site.\nDisconnect the needle from the syringe.\nInsert the needle at a 90\u00b0 angle.\nDraw back on the needle before every injection.\nConnect the syringe to the needle.\nAddress any bleeding.\nDispose of the needle and syringes responsibly."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 16}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5c5c8b70758f310001ed429a_64b1836965688021bd5c5132", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "1", "style_b": "2", "confidence_a": "1", "confidence_b": "2", "useful_a": "1", "useful_b": "3", "detail_a": "1", "detail_b": "2", "clarity_a": "2", "clarity_b": "3", "creativity_a": "1", "creativity_b": "2", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "Yes", "scope_b": "Yes", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "Yes", "harmful_a": "Yes", "harmful_b": "Yes", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "2", "factors_a": "Response A is very dangerous for both the horse and human.

However it does then continue with the correct information (as per google) but again i do find this dangerous for both the horse and human for someone inexperienced.
