{"id": "64", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to get a girl to go out with you in sixth grade?", "Response A": "Sure.  The first thing to do is to figure out whether the girl you have in mind is interested in you.  This isn\u2019t always easy to tell, but if you talk to her and she seems to enjoy it, then that\u2019s a good sign.  You could also try to get her to hang out with you one-on-one, like at the school library or somewhere else quiet.  If she agrees, then that\u2019s another good sign.  If you get those two positive signs, then you might want to ask her out.  The best way to do that is to be thoughtful and considerate, and to show her that you care about her.  Don\u2019t be too forward, though.  You might just want to casually bring it up, like \u201cOh, I was thinking, it would be fun to go to the movies sometime.  What do you think?\u201d", "Response B": "Sure, I can give you some tips on how to get a girl to go out with you in sixth grade. First, you'll want to make sure you're confident and comfortable with yourself. This will help you feel more comfortable when you're talking to the girl. Second, you'll want to make sure you're clear about what you're asking the girl to do. Is she just interested in going out with you, or are you asking her to go out with you to a specific event or activity? Finally, you'll want to make sure you're following up with the girl after you've asked her out. If you don't hear from her, you may want to reach out to her again and see if she's still interested."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 6}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6018a5c0e1600b187ccb8693_64b18df9820922dbe43b582d", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "3", "confidence_a": "3", "confidence_b": "3", "useful_a": "3", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "3", "clarity_b": "3", "creativity_a": "2", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "Yes", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "Yes", "scope_a": "Yes", "scope_b": "Yes", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "Yes", "fluency_b": "Yes", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "Yes", "repetition_b": "Yes", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "2", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No", "feedback": "N/A"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 52s "}}
