{"id": "496", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to give a horse an injection?", "Response A": "Sure, here are the steps:\n\n1) Make sure the horse is calm and relaxed.  If the horse is nervous or upset, it will be more difficult to give the injection.\n\n2) Choose an injection site.  The most common sites are the neck, shoulder, or hip.  Avoid injecting near the tail, as this can cause the horse to kick.\n\n3) Clean the injection site with an alcohol wipe.\n\n4) Insert the needle into the horse at a 90 degree angle.  Try to go in with one motion, and don't push too hard or you might hit a bone.\n\n5) Inject the medication.  Try to do this slowly, so the horse doesn't feel a sudden rush of medicine.\n\n6) Once the injection is complete, withdraw the needle and cover the injection site with a bandage.\n\n7) Monitor the horse for any signs of distress or discomfort.  If the horse seems to be in pain or has a fever, contact your vet immediately.", "Response B": "As an AI language model, I cannot perform medical procedures. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to give an injection to a horse.\n\nFirst, gather the necessary supplies, such as the appropriate needle, syringe, and medication. Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab, and prepare the medication according to the instructions. Hold the horse steady, and insert the needle at a 45-degree angle into the designated injection site. Push the plunger slowly to inject the medication, and remove the needle.\n\nIt is important to note that the exact procedure may vary depending on the type of medication and the specific health condition of the horse. It is always best to consult with a veterinarian or experienced horse owner before attempting to administer injections."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 16}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5ea026ebbc5a78011ea73ffb_64b19a06934e29eeeeaee03d", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "5", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "Yes", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "Yes", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "moor detail and support on A", "factors_b": "No", "feedback": "B was not detailed enough to give confidence"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 7m 26s "}}
