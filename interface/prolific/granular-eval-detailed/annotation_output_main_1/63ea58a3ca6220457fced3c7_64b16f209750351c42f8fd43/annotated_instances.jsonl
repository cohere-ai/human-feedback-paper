Try to focus on your own happiness and well-being during this time. You may want to consider seeking support from friends and family members, or pursuing new hobbies or interests to keep yourself busy. It's also important to take time to reflect and process your feelings before jumping into a new relationship.", "Response B": "Well, I\u2019m not sure that I understand what you mean by \u201cmore space\u201d.
