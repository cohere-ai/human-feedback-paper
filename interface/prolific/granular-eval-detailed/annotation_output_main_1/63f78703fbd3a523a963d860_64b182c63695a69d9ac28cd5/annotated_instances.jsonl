However, there are some common signs that you may be experiencing it. These include feeling tired or exhausted, mood swings, irritability, anxiety, and changes in appetite or sleep patterns. To avoid secondhand stress, it is important to take care of your own mental health and wellbeing. This can include practicing relaxation techniques, setting boundaries, and seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist.", "Response B": "Stress can be difficult to identify, but there are some common symptoms to look out for. Some people experience physical symptoms like muscle tension, headaches, or stomach problems. Others experience emotional symptoms like anxiety, anger, or depression. And some people experience both types of symptoms. If you notice yourself experiencing any of these symptoms on a regular basis, it may be a sign that you are under stress. To avoid secondhand stress, it can help to be mindful of your own stress levels, and try to manage them effectively. You can also try to reduce your exposure to stressful situations."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 23}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63f78703fbd3a523a963d860_64b182c63695a69d9ac28cd5", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "Yes", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "Yes", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "No I did not", "factors_b": "I based my response on the fact that it was more comprehensive on how it answered the question."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 44s "}}
