Relationships in sixth grade are typically not healthy or appropriate, and it is important to focus on building friendships and developing your own interests and passions. It is also important to respect the boundaries and autonomy of others.", "Response B": "Sure.  The first thing to do is to figure out whether the girl you have in mind is interested in you.  This isn\u2019t always easy to tell, but if you talk to her and she seems to enjoy it, then that\u2019s a good sign.

If you get those two positive signs, then you might want to ask her out.  The best way to do that is to be thoughtful and considerate, and to show her that you care about her.  Don\u2019t be too forward, though.  You might just want to casually bring it up, like \u201cOh, I was thinking, it would be fun to go to the movies sometime.
