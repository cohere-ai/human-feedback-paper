However, there are some common signs that you may be experiencing it. These include feeling tired or exhausted, mood swings, irritability, anxiety, and changes in appetite or sleep patterns. To avoid secondhand stress, it is important to take care of your own mental health and wellbeing. This can include practicing relaxation techniques, setting boundaries, and seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist.", "Response B": "Yes, I can!  Secondhand stress is the stress you\u2019re exposed to from other people.  The best way to avoid it is to avoid those people or situations.  You can also try to reduce your own stress by doing things that are relaxing for you.  These include exercise, meditation, and spending time with friends or family.
