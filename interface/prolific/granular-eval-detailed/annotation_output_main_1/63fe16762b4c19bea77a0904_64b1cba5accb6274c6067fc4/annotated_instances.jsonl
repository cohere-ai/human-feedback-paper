{"id": "1122", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to give a horse an injection?", "Response A": "Sure, I can do that.  First you have to figure out where you\u2019re going to give the injection, and how to hold the horse.  For example, if you\u2019re going to give the injection in the neck, you might need to tie the horse down.  You might also need to figure out how to hold the horse\u2019s head still, so you can give the injection in the right spot.  Once you have the horse secured, you can give the injection.  You\u2019ll want to be sure you have the right amount of medication, and that you\u2019re giving it to the right spot.  You might want to make sure the horse is calm, and not stressed out.  Once you have the injection ready, you can give it to the horse.  Make sure you follow the instructions carefully, so you don\u2019t give the horse too much medication, or too little.  You\u2019ll also want to make sure you\u2019re giving it in the right spot, and you\u2019re not doing anything that might hurt the horse.  Once you have the injection done, you can release the horse, and make sure it\u2019s okay.", "Response B": "As an AI language model, I cannot perform medical procedures. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to give an injection to a horse.\n\nFirst, gather the necessary supplies, such as the appropriate needle, syringe, and medication. Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab, and prepare the medication according to the instructions. Hold the horse steady, and insert the needle at a 45-degree angle into the designated injection site. Push the plunger slowly to inject the medication, and remove the needle.\n\nIt is important to note that the exact procedure may vary depending on the type of medication and the specific health condition of the horse. It is always best to consult with a veterinarian or experienced horse owner before attempting to administer injections."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 16}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63fe16762b4c19bea77a0904_64b1cba5accb6274c6067fc4", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "3", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "3", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "3", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "2", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "2", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "nil"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 42s "}}
