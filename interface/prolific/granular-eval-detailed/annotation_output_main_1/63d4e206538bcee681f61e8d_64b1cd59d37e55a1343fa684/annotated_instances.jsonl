The two Romanian women are to be placed on house arrest.\n\nTuesday's extension was the third one granted since the Tates were arrested at the end of 2022.\n\nOn Jan. 20, a judge ordered to keep the Tates behind bars as an investigation into their affairs continued.\n\nThe AP reported that the judge considered the \"particular dangerousness of the defendants\" and their capacity to identify victims \"with an increased vulnerability, in search of better life opportunities,\" when deciding to hold the brothers behind bars.\n\nANDREW TATE CLAIMS BIG TECH BANNED HIM AFTER 'LARGE SWATHS' OF PEOPLE AGREED WITH HIS 'MASCULINE VALUES'\n\nThe Tates appealed the judge's decision but lost on Feb. 1.\n\nAn attorney representing the brothers, Eugen Vidineac, reportedly told reporters before the hearing on Tuesday that the defense would challenge an extension, insisting there was not enough evidence to keep his clients in custody.\n\nAndrew Tate also turned to Twitter before the decision.\n\n\"I can easily think myself into euphoric gratefulness for things as simple as having air to breathe,\" he said. \"I can easily think myself into the deepest and darkest depression. I've seen hell. I've lived hell. I can produce either state. Your reality is self-constructed.\"\n\nCONSERVATIVE NONPROFIT LAUNCHES AD CAMPAIGN TARGETING BILLS OVER BIG TECH CENSORSHIP\n\nShortly after the judge extended the Tate brothers' detention, Andrew posted again.\n\n\"I will meditate deeply over this decision,\" he tweeted.\n\nTate and his three alleged partners had reportedly been under a criminal investigation since April after they were suspected of being involved in a human trafficking scheme in which at least six women were sexually exploited.\n\n\"The four suspects...appear to have created an organized crime group with the purpose of recruiting, housing and exploiting women by forcing them to create pornographic content meant to be seen on specialized websites for a cost,\" prosecutors said. \"They would have gained important sums of money.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nReports on Friday suggested that Tate's renewed social media presence on Twitter may have led to his own arrest.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nSummary: Former kickboxer and social media influencer Andrew Tate and his brother were ordered to spend another 20 days in detention as investigators look into accusations against them.\nIs the summary consistent with the document? First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "The summary is not factually consistent with the document because the document states that Andrew Tate has been detained for 30 days, not 20 days. The document also states that Tate has been under criminal investigation since April, not just since December 2022.\nNo", "Response B": "Yes. The summary accurately describes the court's decision to extend Andrew Tate's detention. The details of the case, including the accusations against him, are also largely correct. However, the summary does not mention that Tate and his brother have consistently denied the allegations against them and insist that they are being targeted as part of a campaign against online influencers."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "factualnlg", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 18}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d4e206538bcee681f61e8d_64b1cd59d37e55a1343fa684", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "3", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "3", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "4", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "Yes", "factors_b": "Yes "}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 3s "}}
