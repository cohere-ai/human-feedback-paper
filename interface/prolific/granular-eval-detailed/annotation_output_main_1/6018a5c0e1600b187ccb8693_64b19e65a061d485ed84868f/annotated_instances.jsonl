{"id": "454", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to grow yellow squash?", "Response A": "Sure! Yellow squash is a type of summer squash.  You can grow it in a garden, or you can grow it in a container.  You want to make sure that you grow it in a warm, sunny spot.  And you want to make sure that you grow it in a rich soil.  You want to make sure that you feed it well, and also that you keep it well-watered.  You want to make sure that you harvest it when it\u2019s still small, and you want to make sure that you handle it gently.  You want to make sure that you don\u2019t leave it in the sun too long, and you also want to make sure that you don\u2019t leave it in the rain too long.  You want to make sure that you grow it in a warm, sunny spot, and you also want to make sure that you grow it in a rich soil.", "Response B": "Sure. You can grow squash in the ground, or you can grow it in a pot. To grow it in the ground, you\u2019ll need a patch of soil that gets lots of sunlight, so that the squash can grow. You can start with a few seeds in the soil, and once they begin to grow, you\u2019ll need to give them room to spread out, and you\u2019ll need to water them regularly so that they can grow. If you grow them in a pot, you\u2019ll need a large pot, and you\u2019ll need to make sure that the pot is very well-drained, so that the roots can grow well. You\u2019ll also need to give the squash room to spread out in the pot, and you\u2019ll need to make sure that the pot is large enough so that the squash can grow. You can start with a few seeds in the pot, and once they begin to grow, you\u2019ll need to give them room to spread out, and you\u2019ll need to water them regularly so that they can grow."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 9}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6018a5c0e1600b187ccb8693_64b19e65a061d485ed84868f", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "2", "confidence_a": "3", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "3", "useful_b": "3", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "2", "clarity_b": "1", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "Yes", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "Yes", "refusal_a": "Yes", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "Yes", "fluency_b": "Yes", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "Yes", "repetition_b": "Yes", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No", "feedback": "N/A"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 8s "}}
