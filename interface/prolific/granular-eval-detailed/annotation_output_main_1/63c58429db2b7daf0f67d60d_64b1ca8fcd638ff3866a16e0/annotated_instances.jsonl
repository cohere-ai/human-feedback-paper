Some signs to look out for include: 1) unsolicited emails or phone calls requesting personal information, 2) promises of easy money with little to no work, 3) requests for payment or wire transfers, 4) phishing websites that steal your personal information, and 5) pressure to act quickly without time to research the company or offer.
