Then you\u2019ll want to microwave it on high for about two minutes, until the sugar is melted and the mixture is bubbling. After that, you\u2019ll want to stir the mixture until it is smooth, and then you\u2019ll want to microwave it for another minute. Make sure you stir it well after this step, and then you want to microwave it for another minute, and then stir it again. You want to repeat this process two more times. After the final step, you want to stir the mixture well, and then you want to microwave it on high for one minute.
