However, I can provide some possible opportunities for brands to use Snapchat's sponsored filters:\n\n1. Location-based marketing: Brands can use Snapchat's geofilters to target users in specific locations, such as near their stores, events, or landmarks. This type of marketing can reach consumers who are already in the vicinity of a brand's physical location.\n\n2. Special offers: Brands can offer discounts or promotions to Snapchat users who use their sponsored geofilters. This can be a great way to incentivize users to engage with the brand and drive foot traffic to physical locations.\n\n3. User-generated content: Snapchat's geofilters can be used to encourage users to create content featuring the brand's logo or product. This can be a great way to engage with users and increase brand awareness.\n\n4. Influencer partnerships: Brands can partner with Snapchat influencers to promote their sponsored geofilters. This can be a great way to reach a larger audience and increase the credibility of the brand.\n\nOverall, Snapchat's sponsored filters provide a unique opportunity for brands to engage with younger consumers in a fun and creative way. With the right strategy, brands can leverage Snapchat's geofilters to drive brand awareness and increase sales.", "Response B": "- Today, the fast food chain has become the first brand to partner with Snapchat on sponsored filters.\n- Snapchat users at a McDonald's restaurant anywhere in the US can add sponsored illustrations to their posts, including a double cheeseburger, French fries, or hearts embedded with the Golden Arches.\n- While the platform has not announced any further partnerships, it is understood that McDonald's was quick to sign up for the beta test of sponsored filters as it has been struggling to attract younger consumers."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 8}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5b421b9ac2e3810001763252_64b1a01adffcc1b9afb77a88", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "2", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "2", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "3", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "3", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "1", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "2", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "Yes", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "Yes", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "Yes", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "Yes", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "There was to much included in the summary and the text was not really a summary, a list of words and then details of the listed words which does not look like a short and concise summary which i would expect even though the information was somewhat informative it was to long.", "factors_b": "i would expect this as a summary in a short but concise roundup of the main article and the main points included so this was better quality i though.", "feedback": "enjoyable to complete, thank you"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 12m 16s "}}
