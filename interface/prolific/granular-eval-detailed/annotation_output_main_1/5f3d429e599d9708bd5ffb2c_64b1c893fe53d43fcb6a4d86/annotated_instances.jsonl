The water has been used exclusively for plant operations but could be used to help the drought-stricken areas. The plan is to buy the extra 60 percent of water from PG&E and construct a pipeline to transport it to the front gate.

The company can produce nearly a million gallons of water a day but this has only been available for internal use so far.  The plan is to buy 60% of this hopefully non-contaminated water from PG&E, which is critically needed in the short term.
