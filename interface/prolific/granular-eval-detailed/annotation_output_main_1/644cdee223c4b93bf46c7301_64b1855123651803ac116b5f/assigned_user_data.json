If the horse is nervous or upset, it will be more difficult to give the injection.\n\n2) Choose an injection site.  The most common sites are the neck, shoulder, or hip.  Avoid injecting near the tail, as this can cause the horse to kick.\n\n3) Clean the injection site with an alcohol wipe.\n\n4) Insert the needle into the horse at a 90 degree angle.  Try to go in with one motion, and don't push too hard or you might hit a bone.\n\n5) Inject the medication.  Try to do this slowly, so the horse doesn't feel a sudden rush of medicine.\n\n6) Once the injection is complete, withdraw the needle and cover the injection site with a bandage.\n\n7) Monitor the horse for any signs of distress or discomfort.  If the horse seems to be in pain or has a fever, contact your vet immediately."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 16}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to give a horse an injection?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Ask an experienced horse person to help out.If you're reading this article, you likely don't have a lot of experience with giving injections.<br/>Have a professional inject a needle-shy horse.<br/>Ask your vet about safety precautions.To be safe, you should know whether the medication would be dangerous to you if you accidentally injected some into yourself.<br/>Use a brand new needle for each injection.<br/>Understand how to give an intramuscular (IM) injection.This is the most common injection method, during which the needle passes through the skin into the muscle underneath.<br/>Decide where on the horse to give the injection.<br/>Put yourself a safe position.<br/>Calm the horse.<br/>Understand why many people prefer giving injections in the neck.<br/>Familiarize yourself with the anatomy of the injection site.<br/>Pinpoint the ideal injection spot.<br/>Know the advantages and disadvantages of a hindquarters injection.<br/>Get to know the anatomy of the hindquarters.<br/>Locate the ideal injection site.<br/>Avoid injecting into the top of the rump.The top of the rump/buttocks used to be a popular injection site because you can stand further forward, out of reach of kicking legs.<br/>Do not \"tap\" the horse at the injection site.<br/>Disconnect the needle from the syringe.<br/>Insert the needle at a 90\u00b0 angle.<br/>Draw back on the needle before every injection.<br/>Connect the syringe to the needle.<br/>Address any bleeding.<br/>Dispose of the needle and syringes responsibly.</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response B </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure, here are the steps:<br/><br/>1) Make sure the horse is calm and relaxed.
