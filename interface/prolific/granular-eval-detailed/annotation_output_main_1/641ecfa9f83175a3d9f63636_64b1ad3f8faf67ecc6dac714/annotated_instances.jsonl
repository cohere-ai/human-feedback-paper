{"id": "285", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to give a horse an injection?", "Response A": "Sure, I can do that.  First you have to figure out where you\u2019re going to give the injection, and how to hold the horse.  For example, if you\u2019re going to give the injection in the neck, you might need to tie the horse down.  You might also need to figure out how to hold the horse\u2019s head still, so you can give the injection in the right spot.  Once you have the horse secured, you can give the injection.  You\u2019ll want to be sure you have the right amount of medication, and that you\u2019re giving it to the right spot.  You might want to make sure the horse is calm, and not stressed out.  Once you have the injection ready, you can give it to the horse.  Make sure you follow the instructions carefully, so you don\u2019t give the horse too much medication, or too little.  You\u2019ll also want to make sure you\u2019re giving it in the right spot, and you\u2019re not doing anything that might hurt the horse.  Once you have the injection done, you can release the horse, and make sure it\u2019s okay.", "Response B": "Sure, here are the steps you should follow:\n\n1.  Go to the horse\u2019s stable and get a clean needle and a vial of the horse\u2019s medication.\n\n2.  Open the vial and pour the medication into the needle.\n\n3.  Insert the needle into the horse\u2019s skin.\n\n4.  Draw up the medication into the needle.\n\n5.  Dispose of the needle and vial in a safe location."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 16}, "label_annotations": {"email": "641ecfa9f83175a3d9f63636_64b1ad3f8faf67ecc6dac714", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "3", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "4", "confidence_b": "3", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "3", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "No other factors.", "factors_b": "No other factors."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 31s "}}
