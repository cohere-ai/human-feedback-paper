In classrooms where students are taught to memorize content and take tests, there is little room for critical thinking. Modern standards, including the Common Core, emphasize these skills and their importance to college and career readiness.\n\nWhile most schools that offer 1:1 device programs incorporate some level of web filtering to keep students from websites that are dangerous or untrustworthy, students should also learn the skills they need to identify such sites on their own. These lessons can be taught at the time of device checkouts at the beginning of the school year and incorporated into guides for students and parents relating to the program.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Schools can teach students how to verify the accuracy of information on sites and learn how to report hateful or malicious content when they encounter it, according to eSchool News.\n\nStudents should also be taught how to discern between information that is trustworthy and information that is not, the report added.", "Response B": "Teaching digital literacy skills must include critical thinking skills that allow students to discern whether information on any given site is trustworthy.
