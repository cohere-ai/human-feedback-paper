Yellow squash are a type of summer vegetable that grow on a vine and are harvested at the end of the summer.  They\u2019re a great source of vitamin A and potassium, and they\u2019re also low in calories and carbohydrates.  Here are some tips on how to grow yellow squash:\n\n1.  Start by planting seeds in the ground, about two weeks before the last frost.  You can plant them in rows, or in small groups.\n2.  Keep the soil moist, and don\u2019t plant the seeds too deep.  You\u2019ll want to keep the soil warm for the seeds to germinate.\n3.  Once the seeds have germinated, you\u2019ll need to support the vines with a trellis or stake.  Make sure the vines are getting enough sunlight, and that they have plenty of room to grow.\n4.  When the vines are about three feet long, you can start to harvest them.  The best way to do this is to cut the vines at the stem, and then you can peel the skin off the inside of the fruit.  You can also cut the fruit into slices, and then cook them in a skillet with a little oil.  Once they\u2019re cooked, you can serve them with salt and pepper."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 9}, "label_annotations": {"email": "644cdee223c4b93bf46c7301_64b1d05d1c3938fdf6302536", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "4", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "yes", "factors_b": "yes", "feedback": "good study"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 47s "}}
