The summary includes important details that are included in the document.

Overall, the summary appears to be reasonably accurate, though it is somewhat brief and does not mention some details included in the document."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "factualnlg", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 9}, "label_annotations": {"email": "637545d6428d85daeedc3df5_64b1991954fa731b95771eeb", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "4", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "3", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "3", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 53s "}}
