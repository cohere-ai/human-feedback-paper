{"id": "508", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Coworking is love\n\nI love the coworking movement. As a perpetually on-the-go freelancer, it's hard to find a decent spot full of like-minded people working in tandem: coffee shops end up being too chatty, I can't count on a library being within walking distance of my lodging, and the whole \"I need a power outlet\" thing puts a bit of a kibosh on working outside most of the time.\n\nRead also: Croissant makes freelance the coolest place to work\n\nThinking outside the box\n\nI would, however, gladly work AT Outsite\u2013the latest in a string of coworking sites dedicated to making sure freelancers and contract workers have access to an environment conducive to productivity. Unlike your run-of-the-mill coworking space, however, this startup emphasizes both working AND playing hard.\n\nWork hard, play hard\n\nThe concept is pretty straightforward: Outsite provides you with a paid membership that gets you hefty discounts on lodging in places such as Santa Cruz, San Diego, and Lake Tahoe. Once there, you work side by side with other freelancers.\n\nAfter a hard day of work, you can relax alongside those same people, with site-specific activities including spas, BBQs, beach activities, and yoga classes, to name a few.\n\nVacation meets productivity\n\nThis is a freakin' cool idea because it takes the allure of a vacation and combines it with the romanticization of working remotely. The final product is a mind-clearing getaway wherein one can focus on work and relaxation in tandem\u2013a concept that, despite its proven health and productivity benefits, is still a minority in the workplace.\n\nAdvertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\nSay no more\n\nFrom a personal standpoint, I'd be delighted to spend a week in any of Outsite's glorious locations with a 60-hour agenda and evenings free.\n\nThis grandiose endeavor is indicative of a surge in popularity of remote work and gig economy.\n\nThese are two cultures in which I happily partake\u2013and the \"work hard, play hard\" aspect of an exotic location paired with the ability to get away from the hustle and bustle of day-to-day life should make for an interesting routine.\n\nIf you find yourself as intrigued as I am, head on over to their website at https://outsite.co and check out their services\u2013I know I'll be keeping a keen eye on this startup.\n\n#Outsite\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "An enterprising start-up is combining work and play for freelancers and business travellers looking to balance productivity and relaxation. The company, Outsite, offers the chance to stay in tourist hotspots such as Lake Tahoe, Santa Cruz and San Diego. For a paid membership, participants can take advantage of shared workspaces where creative collaboration is actively encouraged, as well site-specific \"new networking\" activities, such as yoga classes or BBQs.", "Response B": "The bankruptcy of Spain's renewable energy firm, Abengoa, highlights transition difficulties for energy firms to stable and solvent renewable energy companies.  It also, more poignantly, reveals how connected the economy is and how turbulence in the energy sector could easily spread to other sectors of the economy, thereby creating a broader economic slowdown at any given point. The company's declaration of bankruptcy sent Spanish banking shares tumbling due to concerns that the banks left holding Abengoa's debt may now face heavy losses and low recovery rates.  As the Financial Times pointed out last month, \"we don't believe that this should be viewed as a one-off.  To our minds, the events here show that Spanish banks have yet to take losses on a lot of debt\". Spanish banks are still reeling from the Eurozone crisis, and these developments will not help their quest for profitability and stability."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_13"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5a8d8079190420000156435d_64b1991d3339aac96e7f5941", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "1", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "3", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "1", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "3", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "2", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "1", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "no", "feedback": "none"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 48s "}}
