{"id": "574", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to give a horse an injection?", "Response A": "As an AI language model, I cannot perform medical procedures. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to give an injection to a horse.\n\nFirst, gather the necessary supplies, such as the appropriate needle, syringe, and medication. Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab, and prepare the medication according to the instructions. Hold the horse steady, and insert the needle at a 45-degree angle into the designated injection site. Push the plunger slowly to inject the medication, and remove the needle.\n\nIt is important to note that the exact procedure may vary depending on the type of medication and the specific health condition of the horse. It is always best to consult with a veterinarian or experienced horse owner before attempting to administer injections.", "Response B": "Sure, here are the steps you should follow:\n\n1.  Go to the horse\u2019s stable and get a clean needle and a vial of the horse\u2019s medication.\n\n2.  Open the vial and pour the medication into the needle.\n\n3.  Insert the needle into the horse\u2019s skin.\n\n4.  Draw up the medication into the needle.\n\n5.  Dispose of the needle and vial in a safe location."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 16}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6365b5599c1775edb6d46be4_64b1939c3a64e39bcdfe4be4", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "No.", "factors_b": "No."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 41s "}}
