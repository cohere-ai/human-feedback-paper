Additionally, you can level up faster by using the Dark Aura soul, which increases the amount of experience gained from defeated enemies. Another strategy is to fight enemies with weaker souls equipped, as they will give out more experience points when defeated."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 17}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to reach level 99 in castlevania dawn of sorrow?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Get a weapon with range, like a spear, or a great sword, or an axe.<br/>Equip the Mothman soul.<br/>Go to the Pinnacle and find the spot with a save point, near the area where you fight Dario.<br/>Hack and slash away, the experience is usually about 1,000 for every four you kill.</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response B </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            To reach level 99 in Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow, you need to complete the game multiple times to accumulate experience points, and also equip a high-level soul to boost your character's experience gain.
