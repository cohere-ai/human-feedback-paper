{"id": "1152", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to grow yellow squash?", "Response A": "Sure. You can grow squash in the ground, or you can grow it in a pot. To grow it in the ground, you\u2019ll need a patch of soil that gets lots of sunlight, so that the squash can grow. You can start with a few seeds in the soil, and once they begin to grow, you\u2019ll need to give them room to spread out, and you\u2019ll need to water them regularly so that they can grow. If you grow them in a pot, you\u2019ll need a large pot, and you\u2019ll need to make sure that the pot is very well-drained, so that the roots can grow well. You\u2019ll also need to give the squash room to spread out in the pot, and you\u2019ll need to make sure that the pot is large enough so that the squash can grow. You can start with a few seeds in the pot, and once they begin to grow, you\u2019ll need to give them room to spread out, and you\u2019ll need to water them regularly so that they can grow.", "Response B": "To grow yellow squash, start by selecting a sunny spot in your garden and preparing soil that drains well. Plant the seeds in the soil and keep the soil moist. You can also fertilize the soil with a balanced fertilizer. Harvest the squash when it's still young and tender."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 9}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63468b5809bf04222262bfed_64b1c8eef9917c593d1c132a", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "No", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "3", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "no"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 22s "}}
