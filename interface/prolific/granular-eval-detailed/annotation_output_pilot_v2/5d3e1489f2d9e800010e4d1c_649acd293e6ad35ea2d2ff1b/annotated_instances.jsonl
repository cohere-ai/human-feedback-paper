{"id": "43", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to write a commit message?", "Response A": "Sure! A commit message is a message that you can include in a commit when you are saving a file. It is a way to describe what you have done and why you have done it.\n\nHere are some tips for writing a good commit message:\n\n- Keep it short and sweet. No more than 50 characters.\n- Be descriptive. What have you done?\n- Make it easy to understand. Use descriptive words that make sense to you and others who read your code.\n- Keep it consistent. Use the same format every time you write a commit message.\n- Be careful not to make your commit message too long. It should be no more than 100 characters.\n- Keep it focused. Make sure your commit message is about one specific thing.\n- Don't forget to add a comment. This will help you and others understand what you have done.", "Response B": "Provide a broad subject statement describing the changes.\nAdd a body to the commit message.\nInclude a procedure for testing your change, if possible.\nList\u00a0any caveats to the change you made.\nSquash minor changes together."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "pilot_batch_v2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 0}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d3e1489f2d9e800010e4d1c_649acd293e6ad35ea2d2ff1b", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "4", "style_b": "1", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "1", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "1", "detail_a": "4", "detail_b": "1", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "1", "creativity_a": "4", "creativity_b": "2", "consistent_a": "Yes", "consistent_b": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "No", "scope_a": "Yes", "scope_b": "Yes", "refusal_a": "Yes", "refusal_b": "Yes", "fluency_a": "Yes", "fluency_b": "Yes", "harmful_a": "Yes", "harmful_b": "Yes", "repetition_a": "Yes", "repetition_b": "Yes", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "1", "factors_a": "No", "factors_b": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 17s "}}
