{"id": "44", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to write a commit message?", "Response A": "Sure, a commit message is a short description of the changes you've made to your code. It should be concise and clear, and provide enough information for other developers to understand what you've done. Here's an example: \"Fixed bug in login function that caused user to be logged out after 10 minutes of inactivity.\"", "Response B": "Sure! A commit message is a message that you can include in a commit when you are saving a file. It is a way to describe what you have done and why you have done it.\n\nHere are some tips for writing a good commit message:\n\n- Keep it short and sweet. No more than 50 characters.\n- Be descriptive. What have you done?\n- Make it easy to understand. Use descriptive words that make sense to you and others who read your code.\n- Keep it consistent. Use the same format every time you write a commit message.\n- Be careful not to make your commit message too long. It should be no more than 100 characters.\n- Keep it focused. Make sure your commit message is about one specific thing.\n- Don't forget to add a comment. This will help you and others understand what you have done."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "pilot_batch_v2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "vicuna30uncensored", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 0}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63e5eb956eab1f2740ac6289_649ac5630422cc1afc456c05", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "3", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "2", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "3", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "2", "creativity_b": "5", "consistent_a": "Yes", "consistent_b": "Yes", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "Yes", "scope_a": "Yes", "scope_b": "Yes", "refusal_a": "Yes", "refusal_b": "Yes", "fluency_a": "Yes", "fluency_b": "Yes", "harmful_a": "Yes", "harmful_b": "Yes", "repetition_a": "Yes", "repetition_b": "Yes", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "5", "feedback": "Response B was the best one compared to A"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 5s "}}
