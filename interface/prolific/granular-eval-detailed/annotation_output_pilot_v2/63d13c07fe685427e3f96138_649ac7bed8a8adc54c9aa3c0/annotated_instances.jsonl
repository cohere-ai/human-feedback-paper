It should be concise and clear, and provide enough information for other developers to understand what you've done. Here's an example: \"Fixed bug in login function that caused user to be logged out after 10 minutes of inactivity.\"", "Response B": "A commit message should be a concise and informative summary of the changes made in the commit. It should clearly describe the purpose of the changes and why they were made. It is important to use proper grammar and to avoid using all caps or excessive punctuation. The commit message should also reference any relevant issues or pull requests associated with the changes. Finally, it is recommended to follow a specific format or template to ensure consistency across the project."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "pilot_batch_v2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "vicuna30uncensored", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 0}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d13c07fe685427e3f96138_649ac7bed8a8adc54c9aa3c0", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "2", "style_b": "4", "confidence_a": "4", "confidence_b": "4", "useful_a": "3", "useful_b": "4", "detail_a": "2", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "3", "clarity_b": "3", "creativity_a": "3", "creativity_b": "3", "consistent_a": "Yes", "consistent_b": "Yes", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "Yes", "scope_a": "Yes", "scope_b": "Yes", "refusal_a": "Yes", "refusal_b": "Yes", "fluency_a": "Yes", "fluency_b": "Yes", "harmful_a": "Yes", "harmful_b": "Yes", "repetition_a": "Yes", "repetition_b": "Yes", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "No.", "factors_b": "No.", "feedback": "No comments."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 6m 34s "}}
