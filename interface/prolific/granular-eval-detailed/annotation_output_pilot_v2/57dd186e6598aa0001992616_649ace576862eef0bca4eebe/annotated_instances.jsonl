The use of Instant Message programs by employees during working hours is strictly prohibited.\nBarbara: Sir, does this apply to intra-office communications only? Or will it also restrict external communications?\nCharles: It should apply to all communications, not only in this office between employees, but also any outside communications.\nBarbara: But sir, many employees use Instant Messaging to communicate with their clients.\nCharles: They will just have to change their communication methods. I don't want any - one using Instant Messaging in this office. It wastes too much time! Now, please continue with the memo. Where were we?\nBarbara: This applies to internal and external communications.\nCharles: Yes.
