{"id": "20", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Conversation:\nSimon: You're finally here! What took so long?\nTerence: I got stuck in traffic again. There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection.\nSimon: It's always rather congested down there during rush hour. Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home.\nTerence: I don't think it can be avoided, to be honest.\nSimon: perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work.\nTerence: I think it's something that I'll have to consider. The public transport system is pretty good.\nSimon: It would be better for the environment, too.\nTerence: I know. I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city.\nSimon: Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well.\nTerence: The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car.\nSimon: Well, when it's nicer outside, you can start biking to work. That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides.\nTerence: That's true. I could certainly use the exercise!\nSimon: So, are you going to quit driving to work then?\nTerence: Yes, it's not good for me or for the environment.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "Terence was stuck in traffic and late for work due to congestion near Carrefour intersection. Simon suggested Terence to take public transport or bike to work to avoid traffic and pollution. Terence agreed to consider it and quit driving to work.", "Response B": "The conversation is about traffic jams and finding alternative ways to commute. Simon suggests taking public transport system to work, which Terence agrees would be a better option for the environment. The two discuss various ways to reduce pollution and stress in commuting. Simon also suggests biking to work as a way to get exercise. Terence decides to quit driving to work and switch to public transport or biking."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "pilot_batch_v3", "dataset": "dialogsum", "model_a": "vicuna30uncensored", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 1}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6409e62d6c3b9a78a7e4bd9d_649c49c70760c1b673bd9d8c", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "4", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "3", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "3", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "3", "negative_val": "5", "consistent_a": "Yes", "consistent_b": "Yes", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "Yes", "scope_a": "Yes", "scope_b": "Yes", "refusal_a": "Yes", "refusal_b": "Yes", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "Yes", "harmful_a": "Yes", "harmful_b": "Yes", "repetition_a": "Yes", "repetition_b": "Yes", "overall_a": "4", "overall_b": "5", "factors_a": "no", "factors_b": "no"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 43s "}}
