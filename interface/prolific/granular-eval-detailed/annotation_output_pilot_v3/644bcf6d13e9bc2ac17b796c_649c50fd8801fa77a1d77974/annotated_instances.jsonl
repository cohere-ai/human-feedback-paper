Start by drawing a circle for the head and a slightly larger circle for the body.\n2. Add two smaller circles for the ears and a longer oval for the neck.\n3. Draw two lines for the back and two more for the front legs, making sure they are bent at the knees.\n4. Add a curved line for the belly and another for the tail.\n5. Details can be added such as eyes, nostrils, and mouth.\n6. Finally, add some fur texture with short, curved lines.\n\nWith these steps, you should be able to draw a cute and realistic foal!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "pilot_batch_v3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "vicuna30uncensored", "sample_ix": 1}, "label_annotations": {"email": "644bcf6d13e9bc2ac17b796c_649c50fd8801fa77a1d77974", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "1", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "1", "confidence_b": "5", "useful_a": "1", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "1", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "1", "clarity_b": "5", "creativity_a": "1", "creativity_b": "5", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "consistent_a": "Yes", "consistent_b": "Yes", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "Yes", "scope_a": "Yes", "scope_b": "Yes", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "Yes", "fluency_a": "Yes", "fluency_b": "Yes", "harmful_a": "Yes", "harmful_b": "Yes", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "Yes", "overall_a": "1", "overall_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 14s "}}
