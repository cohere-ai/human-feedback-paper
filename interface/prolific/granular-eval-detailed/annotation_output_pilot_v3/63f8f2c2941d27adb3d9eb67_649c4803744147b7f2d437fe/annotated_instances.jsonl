Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN --\n\nAstronomers have used the James Webb Space Telescope to peer inside the heart of spiral galaxies, where young stars carve out glowing paths.\n\nThe space observatory can see the universe in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye, making the telescope uniquely poised to look through the dust that obscures some galactic features when less powerful telescopes are used.\n\nThe spiral arms of galaxy NGC 7496 are filled with bubbles and shells created by young stars releasing energy.

Pagan of STScI\n\nResearchers participating in the PHANGS collaboration, or Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby Galaxies, are using Webb's infrared capabilities to study 19 spiral galaxies.\n\nSo far, the telescope has observed five of them in detail, including galaxies M74, NGC 7496, IC 5332, NGC 1365 and NGC 1433.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope took this image of NGC 1433, a barred spiral galaxy with a bright core surrounded by double star-forming rings. NASA/ESA/CSA/J. Lee of NOIRLab/A. Pagan of STScI\n\nIn visible light, the galaxies appeared dark and dim. But Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument was able to see the ways that stars and star clusters can shape galactic structure. The never-before-seen details captured in the Webb images show how these intricate networks within galaxies are influenced over time as stars form and evolve.\n\n\"We are directly seeing how the energy from the formation of young stars affects the gas around them, and it's just remarkable,\" said Erik Rosolowsky, a PHANGS team member and an associate professor of physics at the University of Alberta in Canada, in a statement.\n\nStars releasing energy created giant bubbles of gas and dust, or luminescent cavities, that gather around the spiral arms of the galaxies, and sometimes these bubblelike features overlap to form shells and a structure similar to a spiderweb.\n\n\"The PHANGS team has spent years observing these galaxies at optical, radio, and ultraviolent wavelengths using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and the Very Large Telescope's Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer,\" said Adam Leroy, a PHANGS team member and professor of astronomy at Ohio State University, in a statement.\n\nA Webb telescope image of NGC 1365 shows an intricate network of cavernous bubbles and shells as young stars release energy into the galaxy's spiral arms. NASA/ESA/CSA/J. Lee of NOIRLab/A. Pagan of STScI\n\n\"But, the earliest stages of a star's lifecycle have remained out of view because the process is enshrouded within gas and dust clouds.\"\n\nThe observation program will continue to focus on different galaxies, conduct a census of star formation, and unlock more insights about the life cycle of stars and how these stellar objects influence the galaxies they call home.\nSummary: Astronomers have used the James Webb Space Telescope to investigate inside the heart of spiral galaxies, where young stars carve out glowing paths, revealing the surprising weblike structures the stars create within galaxies as they evolve.\nIs the summary consistent with the document? First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "The summary is consistent with the document because it accurately reflects the content of the article. The summary explains that astronomers have used the James Webb Space Telescope to peer inside the heart of spiral galaxies, where young stars carve out glowing paths, revealing the surprising weblike structures the stars create within galaxies as they evolve. The summary accurately describes the article's findings and provides valuable insights into the evolution of stars within galaxies.", "Response B": "The summary accurately captures the key points and findings of the document. It explains how the James Webb Space Telescope has been used to investigate spiral galaxies and uncover the intricate network of cavernous bubbles and shells created by young stars releasing energy. The summary also highlights the importance of these findings in understanding the life cycle of stars and how they influence the galaxies they call home.
