{"id": "19", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Conversation:\nSimon: You're finally here! What took so long?\nTerence: I got stuck in traffic again. There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection.\nSimon: It's always rather congested down there during rush hour. Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home.\nTerence: I don't think it can be avoided, to be honest.\nSimon: perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work.\nTerence: I think it's something that I'll have to consider. The public transport system is pretty good.\nSimon: It would be better for the environment, too.\nTerence: I know. I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city.\nSimon: Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well.\nTerence: The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car.\nSimon: Well, when it's nicer outside, you can start biking to work. That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides.\nTerence: That's true. I could certainly use the exercise!\nSimon: So, are you going to quit driving to work then?\nTerence: Yes, it's not good for me or for the environment.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "The conversation is about traffic jams and finding alternative ways to commute. Simon suggests taking public transport system to work, which Terence agrees would be a better option for the environment. The two discuss various ways to reduce pollution and stress in commuting. Simon also suggests biking to work as a way to get exercise. Terence decides to quit driving to work and switch to public transport or biking.", "Response B": "Terence arrives late because of traffic jam. Simon persuades Terence to use public transportations to keep healthy and to protect the environment."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "pilot_batch_v3", "dataset": "dialogsum", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 1}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6346d9fda71cffd6c403c4a2_649c4d615f09fb165bc35288", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "5", "style_b": "3", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "3", "useful_a": "5", "useful_b": "3", "detail_a": "5", "detail_b": "4", "clarity_a": "5", "clarity_b": "3", "creativity_a": "5", "creativity_b": "3", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "consistent_a": "Yes", "consistent_b": "Yes", "factuality_a": "Yes", "factuality_b": "Yes", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "Yes", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "Yes", "scope_a": "Yes", "scope_b": "Yes", "refusal_a": "Yes", "refusal_b": "Yes", "fluency_a": "Yes", "fluency_b": "Yes", "harmful_a": "Yes", "harmful_b": "Yes", "repetition_a": "Yes", "repetition_b": "Yes", "overall_a": "5", "overall_b": "4", "factors_a": "Not at all", "factors_b": "Not at all", "feedback": "N/A"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 15m 18s "}}
