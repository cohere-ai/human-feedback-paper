Adequate teacher training is of particular importance when bringing new tech into the classroom, and the concern over Trump's proposed budget cuts is that they will particularly hurt low-income rural or urban districts.\n\nFederal spending in school districts is usually a small percentage in comparison with state and local funding, which tends to be generated from the property tax revenue generated per district. It is possible that even in the face of burdensome federal cuts, districts with more robust tax revenue would continue to invest in tech innovation, but impoverished school districts may find it necessary to do without, thus widening the digital divide.\n\nIn a previous Education Dive feature about what to expect in K-12 ed tech in 2017, Robert Craven, the senior director for technology at Tustin Unified School District, predicted an increase in investment from districts and states to improve students' network connectivity off the school grounds in order to combat digital inequity. It remains to be seen if the potential of slashed funds will make districts and states hesitant to expend more money on closing the digital gap, or if the cuts will make the need for greater tech investment that much clearer\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "President Trump's proposed 2018 budget could have an adverse impact on the professional development that enables educators to utilize new technology in the classroom setting, as well as programs that enable greater access to technology for more student populations.

The budget could lead to an adverse impact on teacher training and on the professional development of educators, according to the report. The budget could also adversely affect funding for programs that enable greater access to technology for more student populations. However, an increase in support for charter schools could mean that there will be more technological advances in the classroom."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "pilot_batch_v5_shuffled_mpt", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 3}, "label_annotations": {"email": "615dbec57d764bf5ab0a56e5_64a7f5cd14a64eed8cb7dce6", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "style_a": "3", "style_b": "5", "confidence_a": "5", "confidence_b": "3", "useful_a": "3", "useful_b": "5", "detail_a": "3", "detail_b": "5", "clarity_a": "4", "clarity_b": "4", "creativity_a": "3", "creativity_b": "4", "positive_val": "5", "negative_val": "1", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "inconsistent_b": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "contradiction_b": "Yes", "factuality_a": "No", "factuality_b": "No", "relevance_a": "Yes", "relevance_b": "No", "formatting_a": "Yes", "formatting_b": "Yes", "scope_a": "No", "scope_b": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "refusal_b": "No", "fluency_a": "No", "fluency_b": "No", "harmful_a": "No", "harmful_b": "No", "repetition_a": "No", "repetition_b": "No", "overall_a": "3", "overall_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 7m 48s "}}
