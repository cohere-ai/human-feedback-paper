{"id": "20", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Credit card skimmers, which are devices that can gather information from credit or debit cards that are used to pay at gas station pumps, have been found at two different Manhattan gas stations in two separate calls on March 9 and March 10, according to a March 13 press release from Riley County Police Department.\n\nIn both cases the devices were located inside the pump and were undetectable without opening the pumps. These internal skimmers are becoming more common across the nation, according to the release, and are not detectible by consumers.\n\nThe skimmers were found at the Shop Quik at 529 Richards Dr. and the Shop Quik at 430 Fort Riley Blvd.\n\nRCPD encourages those who purchased gas at the pump from either location to review their bank statements for any fraudulent activity.\n\n\"The best way to protect yourself is to make it a habit to monitor your bank statements and credit reports on a regular basis,\" the release states.\n\nIf fraudulent activity is discovered on bank statements, the statement says to call dispatch at 785-537-2112 to report the crime.\n\n\"Rumors have been swirling about skimmers at other gas stations in town,\" the release states. \"Please note that no additional skimmers have been located at this time.\"\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "MasterCard has announced that its MasterPass digital wallet system will now be compatible with a number of Facebook Messenger bots, including bots from FreshDirect, Subway and The Cheesecake Factory. This means that users will be able to use MasterPass to complete transactions through those apps, without having to enter critical credit card information directly into the chat windows. The MasterPass-enabled bots will work across a range of different services, including retail stores, restaurants and more. MasterCard is not the only company working on payments through bots. A few months ago, PayPal launched a bot for Slack, aimed specifically at making it easier for users to send payments through the Slack app.", "Response B": "Credit card skimmers have been found at two Manhattan gas stations."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_pilot_1", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": "distractor_100", "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5994c52989d01e0001aea32f_64de1be6db7ada443f6050c2", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "1", "score_b": "3", "feedback": "Response A isn't applicable at all.
