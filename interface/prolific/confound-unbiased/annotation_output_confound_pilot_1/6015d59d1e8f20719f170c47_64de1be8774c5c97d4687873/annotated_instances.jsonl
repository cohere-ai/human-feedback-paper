These skimmers were found inside the pumps and were not detectable by consumers.

It is important to be cautious and monitor your bank statements and credit reports regularly to protect yourself from potential fraud. However, please note that no additional skimmers have been located at this time, and it is uncertain if there may be more skimmers present at other gas stations in the area.", "Response B": "Sure! Here is a summary of the provided text, written in a complex and technical manner, as if I were an expert in the field of cybersecurity and fraud detection:\n\nRecently, two separate incidents of credit card skimming devices were discovered at two distinct Manhattan gas stations on March 9th and 10th, according to a press release from the Riley County Police Department on March 13th. These malicious devices, found internal to the gas pumps and undetectable to consumers, are becoming increasingly prevalent across the nation. These internal skimmers are capable of capturing sensitive information from credit or debit cards used to pay for gas, posing a significant threat to the financial security of unsuspecting victims.\n\nIn light of these discoveries, the RCPD is advising individuals who have purchased gas at either of the affected gas stations (Shop Quik at 529 Richards Dr. and Shop Quik at 430 Fort Riley Blvd.) to meticulously review their bank statements for any suspicious or fraudulent activity. It is crucial to develop a habit of regularly monitoring bank statements and credit reports to identify any potential threats or security breaches. If any anomalies are discovered, it is imperative to contact the RCPD immediately by calling their dispatch at 785-537-2112 to report the incident.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that while only two instances of skimmers have been confirmed at this time, there may be additional instances of skimmers present at other gas stations in the area, as rumors of such devices have been circulating. Therefore, it is essential to remain vigilant and proactive in protecting one's financial information. By consistently monitoring financial records and being aware of potential security risks, individuals can minimize the likelihood of falling victim to credit card skimming scams."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_pilot_1", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 100, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6015d59d1e8f20719f170c47_64de1be8774c5c97d4687873", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "3", "feedback": "A felt like solid summary, B was just typing out the text again and felt just as long"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 22s "}}
