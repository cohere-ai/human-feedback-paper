{"id": "459", "input_text": {"Prompt": "The battle between Uber and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is heating up.\n\nThe New York City Council is considering legislation, perhaps as soon as Thursday, which would cap any additional licenses for Uber and other taxi services.\n\nDe Blasio has argued that the rapid growth of Uber in the city -- 2,000 new cars a month, according to the mayor -- is a threat to quality of life, as well as to drivers facing more and more competition.\n\nAt a press conference Monday, he said there are already many more Uber cars in New York City than there are yellow taxis.\n\nAnd he rejected a suggestion from Uber that he engage in an online debate with them.\n\n\"Uber is a multibillion dollar corporation, and they're acting like one. They're looking out for their corporate bottom line,\" de Blasio said.\n\nUber has been fighting back.\n\nThere are ads all over New York City featuring people identified as Uber drivers, all minorities who worry about their jobs. \"I was pretty much struggling to make ends meet,\" said one driver identified as Jashiel. \"When I finally came to Uber, it was probably the best thing that happened in my life.\"\n\nDe Blasio denied that any current Uber drivers would be hurt by the city legislation.\n\n\"All the Uber cars out there will continue, and they will continue to grow, just not as exponentially as they were before,\" he said. \"And that will give us a chance to come up with appropriate regulations.\"\n\nUber has also put a \"de Blasio\" tab on its app, which shows New York riders needing to wait 25 minutes for a car if the mayor's new regulations go through.\n\n\"This is what Uber will look like in NYC if Mayor de Blasio's Uber cap bill passes,\" said the app. It provides a link for Uber users to email de Blasio and the city council.\n\nUber and its supporters claim that de Blasio is simply working on behalf of New York's medallion taxi industry, which reportedly gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to his 2013 election campaign.\n\n\"Millionaire medallion owners don't need help. People like us do,\" said another person identified as a Moises in the Uber ad now blanketing New York airwaves.\n\nUber faces $7.3M fine or California suspension\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is fighting with Uber over how many new cars the ride-sharing company can add to its fleet each month. The mayor believes the addition of 2,000 new cars a month is detrimental to quality of life in the city and will harm the 25,000 traditional taxi and limousine drivers in the city. Uber claims de Blasio is working on behalf of the city's traditional taxi industry, which gave him hundreds of thousands of dollars during his 2013 election campaign.", "Response B": "The ongoing conflict between New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Uber is escalating, with the New York City Council considering legislation to cap additional licenses for Uber and other taxi services. De Blasio argues that Uber's rapid growth is detrimental to quality of life and drivers' well-being, while Uber counters that the proposed regulations are a form of corporate favoritism for the medallion taxi industry, which has donated substantially to de Blasio's election campaign.\n\nTo sway public opinion, Uber has launched a citywide advertising campaign featuring minority drivers who rely on the platform for their livelihoods, highlighting the potential negative impact of the proposed regulations on these individuals. De Blasio has refuted these claims, maintaining that the legislation would not affect current Uber drivers and would instead allow for the development of appropriate regulations.\n\nIn response, Uber has implemented a \"de Blasio\" tab on its app, showcasing the potential wait times that riders could face if the mayor's proposed regulations are implemented. This feature serves as a call to action for Uber users to email de Blasio and the city council, urging them to reject the cap on licenses.\n\nMoreover, Uber faces a $7.3 million fine or suspension in California due to allegations of misleading customers with \"false or misleading\" statements about the safety of their rides. This development adds another layer of tension to the already contentious relationship between Uber and de Blasio.\n\nIn conclusion, the conflict between Uber and de Blasio is a complex issue involving corporate interests, regulatory oversight, and the well-being of drivers and riders. The situation will likely continue to garner attention and public debate, with both parties employing various strategies to sway public opinion and shape the outcome of the legislation."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 121, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "640103805957bbf6a1326ed0_64e3614eba9c8ca5883e4c96", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "3", "feedback": "A is generally good, but does not have all the key information, i feel that B is a bit too long to be considered a summary. it is pretty much an article version or just re written."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 39s "}}
