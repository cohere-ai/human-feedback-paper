This will help you to stand up for yourself and to say no to things that you don't want to do.\n\nYou should also try to be more independent and self-sufficient. This will help you to feel more in control of your own life and to be less likely to be pushed around by others.\n\nFinally, you should try to be more informed and educated about the world around you.
