This approach can lead to a more meaningful and fulfilling connection, regardless of whether your partner identifies as a nerd or not.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to recognize that nerds, like all individuals, have the right to self-identify and express themselves in a way that is authentic and meaningful to them.
