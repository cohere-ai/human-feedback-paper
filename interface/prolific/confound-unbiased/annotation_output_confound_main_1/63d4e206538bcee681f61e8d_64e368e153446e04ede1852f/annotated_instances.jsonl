And it is the latest in several initiatives where the federal government is engaged with non-traditional learning institutions to solve the problem of college affordability and post-graduate career outcomes.\n\nAs many universities are being queried by the federal government on how they spend their endowment money, and enrollment decreases among all institutions nationally, traditional campuses will need to look at these partnerships as a sign of where education is likely going in the future, and what the federal government may be willing to finance with its student loan programs going ahead.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "US coding schools The Iron Yard and Code Fellows have partnered with nonprofit financial literacy organisation Operation HOPE to create a $100m scholarship fund to increase minority and low-income student engagement in tech fields.
