Scrabble is a word game where you and your opponent take turns forming words on a board using tiles. The words can be any combination of letters, and they can be used to score points.

Each word must be made up of letters that are in the correct order and that can be used to score points. For example, the word \"cat\" would not be a valid word because it is not made up of the correct order of letters.\n\nYou can also use special tiles to score extra points.
