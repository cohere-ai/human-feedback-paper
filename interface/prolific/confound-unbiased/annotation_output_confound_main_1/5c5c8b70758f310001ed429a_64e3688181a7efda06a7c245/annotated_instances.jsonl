They're looking out for their corporate bottom line,\" de Blasio said.\n\nUber has been fighting back.\n\nThere are ads all over New York City featuring people identified as Uber drivers, all minorities who worry about their jobs. \"I was pretty much struggling to make ends meet,\" said one driver identified as Jashiel. \"When I finally came to Uber, it was probably the best thing that happened in my life.\"\n\nDe Blasio denied that any current Uber drivers would be hurt by the city legislation.\n\n\"All the Uber cars out there will continue, and they will continue to grow, just not as exponentially as they were before,\" he said. \"And that will give us a chance to come up with appropriate regulations.\"\n\nUber has also put a \"de Blasio\" tab on its app, which shows New York riders needing to wait 25 minutes for a car if the mayor's new regulations go through.\n\n\"This is what Uber will look like in NYC if Mayor de Blasio's Uber cap bill passes,\" said the app. It provides a link for Uber users to email de Blasio and the city council.\n\nUber and its supporters claim that de Blasio is simply working on behalf of New York's medallion taxi industry, which reportedly gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to his 2013 election campaign.\n\n\"Millionaire medallion owners don't need help. People like us do,\" said another person identified as a Moises in the Uber ad now blanketing New York airwaves.\n\nUber faces $7.3M fine or California suspension\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Sure, here is a summary of the article you provided:\n\nThe New York City Council is considering legislation to cap the number of licenses for Uber and other taxi services, and Uber is fighting back with ads featuring minority drivers who fear they will lose their jobs if the legislation passes. Mayor Bill de Blasio argues that the rapid growth of Uber is a threat to quality of life and drivers' jobs, but Uber claims de Blasio is working on behalf of the medallion taxi industry, which has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaign. Uber has also put a \"de Blasio\" tab on its app to show how long riders would have to wait for a car if the new regulations go through.", "Response B": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is fighting with Uber over how many new cars the ride-sharing company can add to its fleet each month. The mayor believes the addition of 2,000 new cars a month is detrimental to quality of life in the city and will harm the 25,000 traditional taxi and limousine drivers in the city. Uber claims de Blasio is working on behalf of the city's traditional taxi industry, which gave him hundreds of thousands of dollars during his 2013 election campaign."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 121, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5c5c8b70758f310001ed429a_64e3688181a7efda06a7c245", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "4", "feedback": "Both response very good but could add a little more detail."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 45s "}}
