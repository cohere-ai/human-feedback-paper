{"id": "947", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to read the mounts of the palm?", "Response A": "Palmistry, also known as chiromancy or palm reading, is the art of interpreting the lines, shapes, and curves on the palm of your hand to gain insight into your personality, future, and life path. There are several different lines and mounts on the palm that palm readers use to interpret your personality, including the life line, heart line, head line, and fate line. Each of these lines has its own meaning and significance, and their placement and shape can provide valuable information about your life and experiences. To learn more about palm reading and how to interpret your own palm, there are many books, websites, and online courses available.", "Response B": "The mounts of the palm are areas of flesh near the base of the fingers.  They are supposed to tell you about the personality of the person whose palm you\u2019re reading.  The biggest one is the mount of Saturn, which is right at the base of the thumb.  The other mounts are the mount of Jupiter, which is right next to it on the palm, and the mount of Apollo, which is near the base of the little finger."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 105, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d7cd776c3b50b48eabd288_64e356aa66c7c607f83b499d", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "2"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 42s "}}
