Define current problems\n\nBefore deciding which innovations to invest in, insurance companies should define the problems they want to resolve, like reducing claims wait times, decreasing operating costs, or providing more tailored insurance products.\n\n2. Identify insurtech opportunities\n\nSome insurers run innovation challenges to develop relevant insurtech solutions, while others opt for in-house insurance innovation labs that foster several insurtech companies. Examples include Met Life's LumenLab, Allianz's Data Lab and Aviva's 'digital garage'.\n\n3. Address integration challenges\n\nInsurers should examine their ability to integrate technologies obtained from insurtech companies. This might involve rethinking their innovation culture and addressing technology barriers.\n\n4. Bring together the right partners\n\nAs they scale up, insurtech startups often partner with established insurers to access distribution networks, capital and regulatory expertise. Traditional insurance players need to seek out insurtech companies with the skills to address their own specific challenges.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Credit card skimmers have been found at two different Manhattan gas stations in two separate calls on March 9 and March 10.
