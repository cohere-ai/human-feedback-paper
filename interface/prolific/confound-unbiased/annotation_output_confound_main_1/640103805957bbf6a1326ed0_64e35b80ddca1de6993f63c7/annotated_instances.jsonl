A dream journal is an excellent way to document and reflect on your dreams, which can be a very valuable source of self-understanding and personal growth. To create a dream journal, all you need is a notebook or journal in which to write down your dreams. It is helpful to keep the journal and a pen or pencil by your bed, and to write down your dreams as soon as you wake up, while they are still fresh in your mind.
