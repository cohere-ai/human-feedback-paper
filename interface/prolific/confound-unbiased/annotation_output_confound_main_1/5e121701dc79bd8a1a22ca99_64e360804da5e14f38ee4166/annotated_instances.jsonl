{"id": "486", "input_text": {"Prompt": "The battle between Uber and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is heating up.\n\nThe New York City Council is considering legislation, perhaps as soon as Thursday, which would cap any additional licenses for Uber and other taxi services.\n\nDe Blasio has argued that the rapid growth of Uber in the city -- 2,000 new cars a month, according to the mayor -- is a threat to quality of life, as well as to drivers facing more and more competition.\n\nAt a press conference Monday, he said there are already many more Uber cars in New York City than there are yellow taxis.\n\nAnd he rejected a suggestion from Uber that he engage in an online debate with them.\n\n\"Uber is a multibillion dollar corporation, and they're acting like one. They're looking out for their corporate bottom line,\" de Blasio said.\n\nUber has been fighting back.\n\nThere are ads all over New York City featuring people identified as Uber drivers, all minorities who worry about their jobs. \"I was pretty much struggling to make ends meet,\" said one driver identified as Jashiel. \"When I finally came to Uber, it was probably the best thing that happened in my life.\"\n\nDe Blasio denied that any current Uber drivers would be hurt by the city legislation.\n\n\"All the Uber cars out there will continue, and they will continue to grow, just not as exponentially as they were before,\" he said. \"And that will give us a chance to come up with appropriate regulations.\"\n\nUber has also put a \"de Blasio\" tab on its app, which shows New York riders needing to wait 25 minutes for a car if the mayor's new regulations go through.\n\n\"This is what Uber will look like in NYC if Mayor de Blasio's Uber cap bill passes,\" said the app. It provides a link for Uber users to email de Blasio and the city council.\n\nUber and its supporters claim that de Blasio is simply working on behalf of New York's medallion taxi industry, which reportedly gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to his 2013 election campaign.\n\n\"Millionaire medallion owners don't need help. People like us do,\" said another person identified as a Moises in the Uber ad now blanketing New York airwaves.\n\nUber faces $7.3M fine or California suspension\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is fighting with Uber over how many new cars the ride-sharing company can add to its fleet each month. The mayor believes the addition of 2,000 new cars a month is detrimental to quality of life in the city and will harm the 25,000 traditional taxi and limousine drivers in the city. Uber claims de Blasio is working on behalf of the city's traditional taxi industry, which gave him hundreds of thousands of dollars during his 2013 election campaign.", "Response B": "After its own poll found that 80% of New Yorkers support Uber, the ride-sharing giant has launched a multi-million dollar ad campaign in the city to fight back against Mayor Bill de Blasio's proposed cap on its operations. The ads, which will appear in print, radio, TV and online, are designed to counter claims that Uber's growth is threatening the livelihoods of yellow taxi drivers. The ads also feature testimonials from Uber drivers, many of whom are minorities. Uber is also running a \"de Blasio\" tab on its app, which shows riders the wait time for a ride if the cap is put in place."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 121, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5e121701dc79bd8a1a22ca99_64e360804da5e14f38ee4166", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 27s "}}
