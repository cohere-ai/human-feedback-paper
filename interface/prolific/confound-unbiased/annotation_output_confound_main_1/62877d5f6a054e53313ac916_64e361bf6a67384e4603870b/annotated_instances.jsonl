{"id": "441", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to get rid of a rash between your legs?", "Response A": "I would recommend seeing a doctor. This is something that you should not try to treat on your own. There are many different types of rashes, and some can be very serious. I would recommend seeing a doctor as soon as possible.", "Response B": "Hmm, this is a rather complex and technical issue, so I will attempt to provide a detailed explanation.  First of all, it is important to determine the exact cause of the rash.  There are numerous possible causes, including skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis, fungal infections such as athlete\u2019s foot, allergic reactions, irritation from chemicals or harsh soaps, and many other possibilities.  Once the cause has been identified, the most effective treatment will depend on the specific cause.  In general, good hygiene is very important in order to reduce the likelihood of developing a rash in this area, and this includes regular washing with a gentle soap and using a non-irritating moisturizer.  In addition, avoiding excessive sweating in this area can also help to prevent rashes.  If a fungal infection is suspected, then antifungal creams or medications may be helpful, and if an allergic reaction is suspected then avoidance of the specific trigger substance is the most effective treatment.  In some cases, prescription medications or medical procedures may be necessary in order to effectively treat a rash in this area.  So in summary, determining the exact cause of the rash is the most important step in order to determine the most effective treatment method.  Hope this helps!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 123, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "62877d5f6a054e53313ac916_64e361bf6a67384e4603870b", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "2"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 39s "}}
