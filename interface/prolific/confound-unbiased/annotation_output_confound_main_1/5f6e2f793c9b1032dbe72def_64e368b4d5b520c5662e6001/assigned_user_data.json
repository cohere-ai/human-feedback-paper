Once you have found a condo that you are interested in, you should contact a real estate agent who specializes in condominiums. They can help you navigate the paperwork and legal aspects of buying a condo. You will also need to get a mortgage and may need to provide a down payment.

First you need to decide what neighborhood you want to live in, and then you need to find a realtor you want to work with. You can look at condos online or in person, and when you find one you like you can make an offer. The seller can accept, reject, or counteroffer.
