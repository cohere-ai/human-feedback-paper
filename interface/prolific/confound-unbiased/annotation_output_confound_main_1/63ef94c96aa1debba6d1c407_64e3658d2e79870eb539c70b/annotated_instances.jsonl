{"id": "253", "input_text": {"Prompt": "A new study conducted using images made by Landsat satellites used by the USGS has found that Bolivian glaciers shrunk by 43 percent between 1986 and 2014. Based on current trends, the researchers estimated that the glaciers could shrink by more than 90 percent by 2100.\n\nThe researchers also found that as the glaciers recede, they are creating high altitude lakes. Some of them are in natural dips in the bedrock; some are accidentally dammed behind walls of glacial debris. All such lakes are susceptible to rockfalls, earthquakes and avalanches that can breach them causing dangerous flooding for mountain communities downstream.\n\nSimon Cook of Manchester Metropolitan University, the study's lead author said:\n\nWe mapped hundreds of lakes. Some lakes are very small and pose little risk. Others are very large, but there's little or no possibility that they would drain catastrophically. Others are both large enough to create a big flood, and sit beneath steep slopes or steep glaciers, and could be dangerous. It's like someone jumping into a swimming pool: It creates an over topping of the lake that can send a flood downstream.\n\nThe risk for glacial lake outburst floods has increased substantially in the past decade as climate change advances. Hundreds of potentially dangerous glacial lakes have formed in the Himalayas during the past few decades. In Bolivia, a glacier outburst flood in 2009 washed away farm animals, crops and bridges.\n\nReceding glaciers also endanger the water supply. The melted water from glaciers is an important source of drinking water and hydroelectric power both for the capital La Paz and neighbouring El Alto which has a combined population of more than two million people.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a summary of the article you provided, but I will respond in a cautious, defensive, and uncertain way, as if I am unfamiliar with the topic:\n\nLubomira Rochet, a representative of L'Or\u00e9al, has made some statements about the company's investment in digital channels and its strategy for influencer marketing. According to Rochet, L'Or\u00e9al is planning to increase its investment in digital channels, specifically in social media influencers, as part of its marketing strategy. The company is working with a startup called Tailify to find influencers to collaborate with across 70 markets. Additionally, L'Or\u00e9al has chosen two other startups, Veleza and Founders Factory, to support its influencer marketing efforts.\n\nHowever, I must note that I am not familiar with the specific details of L'Or\u00e9al's marketing strategy or the startups they are working with. I cannot verify the accuracy of the information provided in the article, and I would advise any reader to approach such information with caution and to consult multiple sources before making any conclusions. Additionally, I would like to emphasize that it is important to be cautious when relying on online sources, as misinformation and biased reporting can be prevalent.", "Response B": "Sure! Here's the summary you requested:\n\nGlaciers in Bolivia are melting. They are going away. They are getting smaller. This is bad because it can cause big floods and hurt people. The water that comes from the glaciers is important for people to drink and make electricity. The glaciers are also making lakes that can be dangerous. Some of these lakes can flood and hurt people. The floods can also damage farms and bridges. The glaciers are getting smaller because of the climate. The climate is changing and making the glaciers melt. This is a big problem for the people who live near the glaciers."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": "distractor_102", "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63ef94c96aa1debba6d1c407_64e3658d2e79870eb539c70b", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "2", "score_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 6s "}}
