{"id": "1117", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to remove mineral spots from fabric?", "Response A": "There are several methods to remove mineral spots from fabric, depending on the type of fabric and the severity of the stain. Some methods include using a mixture of vinegar and water, lemon juice and salt, or a commercial stain remover. It's important to test any solution on a small, inconspicuous area of the fabric first to make sure it doesn't cause any damage or discoloration. Additionally, it's always a good idea to follow the care label instructions for the fabric to ensure the best results.", "Response B": "Yes. The first step is to determine what kind of mineral spot you have. There are two types: water-based and oil-based. Water-based mineral spots can be removed with a mixture of water and dish soap, while oil-based mineral spots require a mixture of vinegar and water. Once you know what type of mineral spot you have, you can begin to remove it."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 104, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5c5cad3e4ee81200018eafe2_64e3691e55853802525add73", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "4", "feedback": "Both responses are good but I think response A just goes a bit further into the method of dealing with the stain."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 15s "}}
