{"id": "904", "input_text": {"Prompt": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As new employees were brought into Apple's secret effort to create a self-driving car a few years ago, managers told them that they were working on the company's next big thing: A product that would take on Detroit and disrupt the automobile industry.\n\nThese days, Apple's automotive ambitions are more modest. The company has put off any notion of an Apple-branded autonomous vehicle and is instead working on the underlying technology that allows a car to drive itself. Timothy D. Cook, the company's chief executive, said in an interview with Bloomberg in June that Apple is \"focusing on autonomous systems.\"\n\nA notable symbol of that retrenchment is a self-driving shuttle service that ferries employees from one Apple building to another. The shuttle, which has never been reported before, will likely be a commercial vehicle from an automaker and Apple will use it to test the autonomous driving technology that it develops.\n\nFive people familiar with Apple's car project, code-named \"Titan,\" discussed with The New York Times the missteps that led the tech giant to move \u2014 at least for now \u2014 from creating a self-driving Apple car to creating technology for a car that someone else builds. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about Apple's plans.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Apple had a secret project called Titan to create a self-driving car a few years ago. But now Apple has put off any notion of an Apple-branded autonomous vehicle and is working on the underlying technology that allows a car to drive itself. Also, Apple is using a self-driving shuttle service to ferry employees from one Apple building to another to test the autonomous driving technology it develops.", "Response B": "Apple's autonomous driving ambitions have scaled back in recent years, with the company instead focusing on the underlying technology that allows a car to drive itself, according to a report in the New York Times. The tech giant has reportedly abandoned any notion of an Apple-branded autonomous vehicle, and is instead working on the technology for a car that someone else builds. The company is developing a self-driving shuttle service to ferry employees between Apple buildings, which is expected to be a commercial vehicle from an automaker."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 116, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5b1efc25bdf4e1000163af46_64e357978080fdf5e88cb465", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 4s "}}
