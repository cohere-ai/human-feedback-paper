{"id": "274", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to bowl?", "Response A": "Sure! Bowling is a game that involves rolling a heavy ball down a lane towards a set of pins. The objective is to knock over as many pins as possible. \n\nTo bowl, you will need a bowling ball, a set of bowling pins, and a lane. You can find these items at most bowling alleys.\n\nTo begin, you will need to position the bowling ball at the head of the lane. You can then roll the ball down the lane towards the pins. The pins will be knocked over as the ball rolls down the lane.\n\nOnce the ball has reached the pins, you will need to adjust your aim and roll the ball again. You can continue to roll the ball until all of the pins have been knocked over.\n\nIt's important to note that bowling is a game of skill and precision. You will need to practice and develop your technique to become a better bowler.", "Response B": "Sure! To bowl, you need to stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms by your side. Then, you need to hold the bowling ball with your thumb on top and your fingers wrapped around the bottom. Finally, you need to roll the ball down the lane towards the pins."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 111, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5c5c8b70758f310001ed429a_64e36544bc24ea628d3f0907", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "2", "feedback": "Response A is a full and concise explanation.
