The heart mount is the center of the palm, and it is used to identify the person's age. The palm mount is the bottom of the palm, and it is used to identify the person's profession.

The ring finger mount is the ring finger of the hand, and it is used to identify the person's relationship status.\n\nThere are many different ways to read the mounts of the palm, and the most common is to use a system of numbers.
