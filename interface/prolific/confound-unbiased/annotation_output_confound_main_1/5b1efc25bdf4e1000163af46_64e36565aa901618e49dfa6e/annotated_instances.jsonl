{"id": "271", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to bowl?", "Response A": "Sure! Here are the basic steps for how to bowl:\n\n1. Approach the lane: Start by standing at the foul line, which is the line that marks the beginning of the lane. The lane is the long, narrow surface that the ball travels down.\n2. Position your feet: Place your feet in the starting position, which is usually about shoulder-width apart. The starting position can vary depending on the bowler's preference and style.\n3. Grip the ball: Hold the ball in your dominant hand, and use your other hand to support it. The grip can also vary depending on the bowler's preference and style.\n4. Bowl the ball: To bowl the ball, start by swinging your arm back behind you, and then swing it forward and release the ball. The ball should travel down the lane and hit the pins.\n5. Follow through: After releasing the ball, continue to move forward and follow through with your swing. This will help you maintain balance and control.\n\nThese are the basic steps for how to bowl. There are many different styles and techniques that can be used to bowl, so it's important to find what works best for you. It's also important to practice and improve your skills, as bowling can be a challenging sport.", "Response B": "I think so. I've never actually done it myself, but I've seen it done. I think you start by standing at the line with the ball in your hand. Then you take a step forward and let the ball go. It should roll down the lane and knock over the pins. I think."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 111, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5b1efc25bdf4e1000163af46_64e36565aa901618e49dfa6e", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "2"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 19s "}}
