The military will also develop 100 unmanned vehicles for DMZ search operations. The projects are in response to the latest North Korean landmine attack that severely wounded two South Korean soldiers.", "Response B": "Sure! Here is a summary of the article using short words and simple language:\n\nThe military is making new robots to find and remove dangerous things in a special place called the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The robots will help keep people safe. There will be 170 robots and it will cost less than $431 million. This is important because some people got hurt from a dangerous thing called a landmine. The military wants to make sure everyone is safe."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 123, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63ea5f39871e9fdef021a53d_64e47f5e2fc239a387072457", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "3", "feedback": "Response B seem to be written in a fairly patronising tone."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 45s "}}
