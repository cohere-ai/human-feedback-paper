{"313": {"id": "313", "text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to play scribblenauts?", "Response A": "Sure! Scribblenauts is a puzzle game where you have to write words to solve the puzzles. The words can be anything, from simple objects to more complex concepts. You use the words to create objects or to change the environment in some way to help you solve the puzzle.\n\nFor example, if you're trying to get a ball to a goal, you might write \"ladder\" to create a ladder to help you get to the goal. Or you might write \"wind\" to create a wind that will blow the ball towards the goal.\n\nIt's a really fun game that's great for people of all ages.", "Response B": "Absolutely! Scribblenauts is a puzzle video game developed by 5th Cell and published by Nintendo. It was released in 2009 for the Nintendo DS, and in 2010 for the Wii U. The game is a sequel to the 2006 game, Scribblenauts: The Complete Collection. \n\nThe game is played from a first-person perspective, with the player controlling the character using the DS's touch screen. The player must draw a word on the screen, and the character will then use that word to complete the level. The player must complete the level within a certain time limit, and must also collect stars along the way. The player can also use words to create objects and characters that can help them complete the level.\n\nThe game has a total of 200 levels, with new levels being added in regular updates. The game has also been released for the Wii U, and has been ports to iOS and Android devices.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 120, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to play scribblenauts?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure!
