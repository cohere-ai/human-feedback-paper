You\u2019ll work with them to determine your budget and what features you\u2019re looking for in a property, and then they\u2019ll help you find and make an offer on a condo that meets your criteria.  If you\u2019re buying as an investment, you\u2019ll want to work with a real estate agent or property manager who can help you find a property that will generate income as a rental.", "Response B": "The process of buying a condo usually starts with researching different neighborhoods and communities that fit your needs and budget. Once you have found a few options, you can start working with a real estate agent who can guide you through the process of finding and purchasing a condo. It's important to have a good understanding of your finances and credit score before starting the process, as well as to communicate with your agent about any specific needs or wants you have for your new home."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 110, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to buy a condo?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure, if you\u2019re looking to purchase a condominium as an owner-occupant, you\u2019ll want to find a real estate agent who specializes in representing buyers.
