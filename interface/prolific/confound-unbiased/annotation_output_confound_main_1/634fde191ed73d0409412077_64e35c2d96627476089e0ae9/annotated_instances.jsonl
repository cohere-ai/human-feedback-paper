The company has put off any notion of an Apple-branded autonomous vehicle and is instead working on the underlying technology that allows a car to drive itself. Timothy D. Cook, the company's chief executive, said in an interview with Bloomberg in June that Apple is \"focusing on autonomous systems.\"\n\nA notable symbol of that retrenchment is a self-driving shuttle service that ferries employees from one Apple building to another. The shuttle, which has never been reported before, will likely be a commercial vehicle from an automaker and Apple will use it to test the autonomous driving technology that it develops.\n\nFive people familiar with Apple's car project, code-named \"Titan,\" discussed with The New York Times the missteps that led the tech giant to move \u2014 at least for now \u2014 from creating a self-driving Apple car to creating technology for a car that someone else builds. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about Apple's plans.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "iOS 14: Apple delays new privacy changes as app makers appeal>\n\nThe project began in 2014 with about 1,000 Apple employees, and it was to be the brainchild of Steve Zadesky, a former Ford Motor Company engineer who had joined Apple in 1999.\n\nThree years later, a new team leader, Doug Field, who had worked on Apple's Macintosh computer and the iPhone, took over the project. He had been at Apple for 22 years and left in 2013 to lead the product development efforts at Tesla, where he worked for two years.\n\nIn 2017, Apple added a new leader, John Wright, who joined from Ford.\n\nApple's project was a secret, and even some top Apple executives were not aware of it. But from the start, the team had a tough assignment. Apple lacked the automotive expertise to build cars, and its ambitions for an Apple-branded car \u2014 including a self-driving vehicle \u2014 seemed unrealistic given the long lead time required to develop and produce a car.\n\nThe project's ambitious timetable was a barrier from the start. The Apple team, based at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., and at a nearby industrial park, would have to design a car from scratch, build it in large numbers and get it on the road in a few years.\n\nThe team initially wanted to design a vehicle that would drive itself and not have a steering wheel or pedals. The project was aimed at a goal of demonstrating an autonomous car in 2019.\n\nBut the project faced hurdles from the start. The team asked Apple's design team to create a vehicle that resembled a minivan, but the designers said the vehicle was too large and too tall. Eventually, the team agreed to rework the design, but the change led to other issues that affected the timetable.\n\nApple's car project also faced a rival within the company that was working on a similar project. Apple Watch was being developed by a team led by Jeff Williams, the senior vice president for operations, who was also chief executive of Apple's health unit. Apple Watch had to take priority over Titan.\n\nThe health unit had committed to shipping the device in the spring of 2015, so the team had to complete the Apple Watch's development.\n\nEven as the Apple Watch team was working to get the device ready for its spring 2015 shipping deadline,", "Response B": "1.
