In IVF, a woman\u2019s eggs are harvested and fertilized with a man\u2019s sperm in a laboratory, and the embryos are then transferred back into the woman\u2019s uterus.  This process increases the chances of pregnancy, and many healthy babies have been born using this method.

To decorate a fishtank, you might want to get some rocks, plants, or other objects to put inside.  You could also use paint or stickers to make the tank more colorful.  You might want to put some fish in the tank, and they might need some food, or a place to hide.  You could also add things like bubbles or floating objects to make the tank more interesting.
