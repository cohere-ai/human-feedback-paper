You\u2019ll work with them to determine your budget and what features you\u2019re looking for in a property, and then they\u2019ll help you find and make an offer on a condo that meets your criteria.  If you\u2019re buying as an investment, you\u2019ll want to work with a real estate agent or property manager who can help you find a property that will generate income as a rental.", "Response B": "Sure! First you need to decide what neighborhood you want to live in, and then you need to find a realtor you want to work with. You can look at condos online or in person, and when you find one you like you can make an offer. The seller can accept, reject, or counteroffer. Once you and the seller agree on a price and terms, you\u2019ll close on the condo and become the new owner!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 110, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5c5cad3e4ee81200018eafe2_64e365fafb95e586c0ee4172", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "4", "feedback": "Response A is clear and explicit about the method to find a condo.
