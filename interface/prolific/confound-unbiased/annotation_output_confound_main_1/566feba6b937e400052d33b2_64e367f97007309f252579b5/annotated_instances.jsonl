They are supposed to tell you about the personality of the person whose palm you\u2019re reading.  The biggest one is the mount of Saturn, which is right at the base of the thumb.  The other mounts are the mount of Jupiter, which is right next to it on the palm, and the mount of Apollo, which is near the base of the little finger.", "Response B": "The mounts of the palm are the different areas of the palm that are used to identify different things. There are five mounts, each with its own unique pattern. The mounts are the head, the heart, the palm, the index finger, and the ring finger.\n\nThe head mount is the top of the palm, and it is used to identify the person's gender. The heart mount is the center of the palm, and it is used to identify the person's age. The palm mount is the bottom of the palm, and it is used to identify the person's profession. The index finger mount is the middle finger of the hand, and it is used to identify the person's personality. The ring finger mount is the ring finger of the hand, and it is used to identify the person's relationship status.\n\nThere are many different ways to read the mounts of the palm, and the most common is to use a system of numbers. The numbers are used to identify the different areas of the palm, and they are assigned a value based on their location and shape.\n\nFor example, the head mount is assigned the number 1, the heart mount is assigned the number 2, the palm mount is assigned the number 3, the index finger mount is assigned the number 4, and the ring finger mount is assigned the number 5.\n\nThe values of the mounts of the palm can be used to identify a person's gender, age, profession, personality, and relationship status."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 105, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "566feba6b937e400052d33b2_64e367f97007309f252579b5", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "5", "feedback": "none thank you"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 4s "}}
