You will also need to come up with a backstory for your character, as well as a personality and appearance.\n\nOnce you have created your character, you will need to choose a subclass that will determine your character's focus and abilities. There are many different subclasses to choose from, such as the College of Lore or the College of Valor.\n\nOnce you have chosen a subclass, you will need to select your skills and abilities. These will determine how your character will interact with the world and other characters.\n\nFinally, you will need to come up with a plan for how your character will progress and grow throughout the game. This will involve choosing new abilities and skills as your character levels up, as well as developing relationships with other characters and exploring the world.", "Response B": "A bard in Dungeons and Dragons is a versatile class of spellcaster, able to perform a variety of tasks.
