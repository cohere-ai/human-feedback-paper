{"id": "408", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to clean a computer monitor?", "Response A": "As an AI language model, I can suggest the following steps for cleaning a computer monitor:\n\n1. Turn off the monitor and unplug it from any power source.\n2. Use a microfiber cloth to gently wipe the screen and remove any dust or debris.\n3. Mix equal parts water and isopropyl alcohol in a spray bottle.\n4. Spray the solution onto the cloth, rather than directly onto the screen.\n5. Wipe the screen again with the damp cloth.\n6. Use another dry microfiber cloth to remove any excess moisture from the screen.\n7. Wait for the monitor to dry completely before turning it back on and using it.\n\nIt is important to note that using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials on a computer monitor can cause damage. It is recommended to use only the recommended cleaning methods for your specific monitor.", "Response B": "Hmm this is a very broad and complex question, and I would need to know much more about your specific situation and equipment in order to give helpful advice.  In general however, monitor screens can become dirty or smudged over time due to contact with fingerprints and other contaminants.  There are various cleaning products specifically designed for this purpose which can be purchased from office supply stores, and I would recommend using one of these products in conjunction with a soft cloth or cotton swab for best results.  Be sure to follow the instructions on the cleaning product carefully, as some of these products can be quite harmful if used incorrectly.  Another important consideration is the proper adjustment and calibration of the monitor itself, as this will greatly affect the visual appearance of the screen.  If you are having trouble with the appearance of your monitor screen, I would recommend seeking the advice of an expert in the field, or alternatively you could try adjusting the settings using the manual controls on your monitor.  \nHope this helps!  Good luck!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 50, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "607da171f464f9e638d62de2_64f9937b54a72e310c2973ef", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "3", "feedback": "Both answers make assumptions about the monitor and may give incorrect advice."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 50s "}}
