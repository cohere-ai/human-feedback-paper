I'd be delighted to guide you through the process of creating the most scrumptious baked apples with a heavenly vanilla sauce. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf70\n\nFirst, let's start with the apples. You'll need to preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). While your oven is warming up, core some delicious apples (I prefer Granny Smith or Golden Delicious) and fill the centers with a mixture of brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of salt. \ud83c\udf4f\ud83e\udddd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nNow, place the apple cores on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the apples are tender and caramelized. \ud83c\udf5e\ud83d\udc4c\n\nWhile the apples are baking, let's move on to the vanilla sauce. In a medium-sized saucepan, combine 2 tablespoons of butter, 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. \ud83e\udd44\ud83c\udf5c\n\nOver medium heat, stir the mixture until the butter and sugar have melted, and the sauce is smooth and creamy. \ud83c\udf6b\ud83d\udc4c\n\nOnce the apples are done baking, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. Serve the baked apples warm, topped with the divine vanilla sauce. \ud83c\udf4f\ud83e\udd5d\n\nAnd there you have it, my dear! A delectable dessert that's perfect for the fall season. The combination of sweet, tender apples and the creamy vanilla sauce will have your taste buds doing the cha cha slide with joy! \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc83\n\nSo go ahead, give this recipe a try, and let me know what you think! And remember, always use fresh and high-quality ingredients, and never hesitate to experiment with different flavors and spices to make this dish your own. \ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc69\u200d", "Response B": "Of course!  Let\u2019s start by reviewing some basic cooking techniques.  It\u2019s important to preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, and to grease a baking dish with a little butter or oil.  Next, wash and core the apples, and place them in the prepared baking dish.  Now we\u2019ll make the vanilla sauce: in a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of sugar, 2 tablespoons of melted butter, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1/2 cup of milk.  Mix well, and pour over the apples.  Bake for 30-40 minutes, until the apples are tender.  For the topping, combine 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and 2 tablespoons of melted butter.  Spread this mixture over the apples, and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes.  The apples are done when they are tender and the topping is lightly browned.  Serve the apples warm, with ice cream or vanilla sauce, and enjoy!"}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 53, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to make baked apples with vanilla sauce?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Oh my, you've come to the right place!
