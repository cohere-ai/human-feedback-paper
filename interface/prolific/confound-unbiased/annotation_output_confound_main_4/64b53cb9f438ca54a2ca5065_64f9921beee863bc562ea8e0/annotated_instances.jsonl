However, I can suggest some ways to take your teddy bear on long trips. One way is to pack it in a small bag or suitcase so that it can fit easily into your luggage. Another option is to bring along an empty bag and fill it with soft, fluffy items like blankets or pillows so that your teddy bear can snuggle up and stay comfortable during the journey. You can also consider bringing a small portable speaker or music player with some of your teddy bear's favorite songs or stories to help keep them entertained. Lastly, don't forget to bring along their favorite snacks or treats to keep them happy and satisfied during the trip."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 57, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "64b53cb9f438ca54a2ca5065_64f9921beee863bc562ea8e0", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "2"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 35s "}}
