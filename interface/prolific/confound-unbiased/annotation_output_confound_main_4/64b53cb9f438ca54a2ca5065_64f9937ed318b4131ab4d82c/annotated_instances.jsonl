The basic components are a cake roll, which is a rolled cake typically filled with a sweetened cream filling, and pudding, which can be vanilla, chocolate, or butterscotch pudding.  To assemble the dessert, you will layer the components in a glass trifle bowl or other clear glass dish.  You will start with a layer of cake roll, followed by a layer of pudding, and repeat these layers until you have used all of the ingredients.  You can garnish the dessert with whipped cream and chopped nuts, and serve it with caramel or chocolate sauce for drizzling.  This dessert is best served chilled, and can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two days."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": "distractor_60", "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "64b53cb9f438ca54a2ca5065_64f9937ed318b4131ab4d82c", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "1", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 18s "}}
