{"id": "105", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to serve at a dinner party?", "Response A": "Sure! Here are some tips for serving at a dinner party:\n\n- Be polite and courteous to your guests.\n- Make sure everyone has enough to eat and drink.\n- Clear away any dishes or glasses that are no longer needed.\n- Keep the table clean and organized.\n- Be a good host and make sure everyone is having a good time.", "Response B": "Certainly. Here are some suggestions:\n\n-Have a plan for the evening, so you\u2019re not running around frantically at the last minute.  You\u2019ll want to make sure you have enough time to prepare and serve each course.  So if you\u2019re planning to serve a four-course meal, you might want to have a main course that takes about 30 minutes to prepare, and a dessert that takes about 15 minutes.  Then you might want to have a first course that takes 5-10 minutes to prepare, and a second course that takes about 20 minutes.\n-Figure out how many people you\u2019re serving, and whether you\u2019re serving family style or individually.  If you\u2019re serving family style, you\u2019ll want to make sure you have enough plates, bowls, and silverware for everyone.  And if you\u2019re serving individually, you\u2019ll want to make sure you have enough of each dish to go around.\n-Make sure you have all the ingredients for each course prepared ahead of time.  If you\u2019re making a salad, make sure you have the lettuce washed and chopped, the dressing made, and so on.  If you\u2019re making a main course, make sure you have all the ingredients prepped and ready to go.  If you\u2019re making a dessert, make sure you have the dessert prepared and ready to go.  This will make the evening go much more smoothly.\n-Before you start serving, make sure the table is set appropriately.  If you\u2019re not using placemats, you\u2019ll want to make sure the table is properly set"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 62, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d79fcd741f9cfb2f87152f_64f997cd03961e0cf09da622", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 44s "}}
