Labor's policy on the sharing economy acknowledges the potential benefits of the sharing economy, while also acknowledging the need to protect consumers and ensure that everyone pays their fair share of tax and complies with relevant laws.  Labor's policy proposes a number of principles to guide regulation of the sharing economy, including a \"primary property is yours to share\" principle, which states that people should be free to participate in the sharing economy without facing heavy-handed regulation, and a \"zero tolerance\" approach to those who continue to flout Australian laws.  Labor's policy also emphasizes the need to ensure that everyone engaged in the sharing economy pays a fair share of tax and complies with relevant laws and regulations.  Finally, Labor's policy supports the sharing economy provided that wages and conditions are protected, and that sharing economy services are accessible to Australians with disabilities.", "Response B": "The Australian Labor Party (ALP) has released a policy paper outlining its approach to the sharing economy, the first of its kind in Australia. The paper details the principles of the ALP's approach, which includes the belief that primary property is yours to share and should be free of heavy-handed regulation, that the sharing economy should not compromise wages and conditions, that everyone engaged in business across the sharing economy must pay a fair share of tax at the standard rate, that sharing economy services must have property insurance and be covered by consumer law, and that they must be accessible to Australians with disabilities. The ALP also believes that tailored, light-touch rules should be put in place for the sharing economy, with zero tolerance for those who continue to flout Australian laws."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 70, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63469effac5117e39352c13b_64f9943eeaff39bf21bdfd2c", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "4", "feedback": "Both responses are satisfactory in terms of content but could be better paragraphed or bullet pointed."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 48s "}}
