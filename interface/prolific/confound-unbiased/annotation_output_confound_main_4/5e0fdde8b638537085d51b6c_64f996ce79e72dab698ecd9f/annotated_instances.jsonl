The ALP's policy document sets out five principles, including the idea that primary property is \"yours to share\" and should be free of heavy-handed regulation, but that sharing economy services must have property insurance and be covered by consumer law. The ALP also believes that a person who uses their own car, home or goods to deliver services is hardly as high-risk as running a big business.", "Response B": "Researchers have discovered hundreds of Android apps that are leaking sensitive secret keys and tokens that could be used and abused by hackers. Fallible, a Delaware-based security firm, spent the past few months reverse engineering thousands of apps to discover security issues, such as leaky secret keys. These keys often belong to third-party services to help app integration, but if leaked, they could be used to manipulate or abuse the services. While most of the 16,000 apps they examined didn't leak any keys, a little over 300 apps contained easily-found, hard-coded keys for services like Dropbox, Twitter, and Slack."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_70", "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5e0fdde8b638537085d51b6c_64f996ce79e72dab698ecd9f", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 52s "}}
