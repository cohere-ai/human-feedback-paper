You want to set a clear boundary, but you also want to make sure the person knows you aren\u2019t angry with them. So maybe you could say something like, \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate that kind of talk, please don\u2019t do it again.\u201d Or you could just ignore them, that might be the best approach.", "Response B": "I don\u2019t have much experience with google slides, but I have some experience creating presentations in other programs. I could try to help you by describing the process I would use in another program, and maybe that will be similar enough to google slides to be useful. The first step would be to open the program and create a new presentation. Then I would add a title slide and perhaps also a contents slide. After that, I would add the individual slides with the content of the presentation, arranging them in the order I want. I might also add transition effects between slides, and animations for the title and contents slide. Does that sound like a process you could follow?"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_71", "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d79fcd741f9cfb2f87152f_64f98e34ab8b02711ea2076b", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "1"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 28s "}}
