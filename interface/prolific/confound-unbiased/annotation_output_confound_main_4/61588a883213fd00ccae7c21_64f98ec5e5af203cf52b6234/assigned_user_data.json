Let\u2019s start by reviewing some basic cooking techniques.  It\u2019s important to preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, and to grease a baking dish with a little butter or oil.  Next, wash and core the apples, and place them in the prepared baking dish.  Now we\u2019ll make the vanilla sauce: in a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of sugar, 2 tablespoons of melted butter, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1/2 cup of milk.  Mix well, and pour over the apples.  Bake for 30-40 minutes, until the apples are tender.  For the topping, combine 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and 2 tablespoons of melted butter.  Spread this mixture over the apples, and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes.
