Let\u2019s start by reviewing some basic cooking techniques.  It\u2019s important to preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, and to grease a baking dish with a little butter or oil.  Next, wash and core the apples, and place them in the prepared baking dish.  Now we\u2019ll make the vanilla sauce: in a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of sugar, 2 tablespoons of melted butter, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1/2 cup of milk.  Mix well, and pour over the apples.  Bake for 30-40 minutes, until the apples are tender.  For the topping, combine 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and 2 tablespoons of melted butter.  Spread this mixture over the apples, and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes.  The apples are done when they are tender and the topping is lightly browned.  Serve the apples warm, with ice cream or vanilla sauce, and enjoy!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 53, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "61588a883213fd00ccae7c21_64f98ec5e5af203cf52b6234", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "5", "feedback": "Response B answers the question, rather than supplying just a recipe "}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 33s "}}
