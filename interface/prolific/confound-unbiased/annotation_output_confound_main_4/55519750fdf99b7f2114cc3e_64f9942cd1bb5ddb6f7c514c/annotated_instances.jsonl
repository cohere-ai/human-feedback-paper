{"id": "366", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Google will now scan your emails for information relevant to advertising just a bit slower thanks to a settlement of a case pending in a Northern California district court. The system will now scan those emails after they're available in the recipient's Gmail mailbox, in contrast to Google's prior practice, where the email was scanned during the delivery process.\n\nSince each email message is scanned to deliver more relevant ads, the process meant that non-Gmail accounts were indirectly being cataloged as well. The plaintiffs in the case, which was styled Matera vs. Google, argued that this was a violation of both the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the California Information Privacy Act, calling the strategy \"the twenty-first-century equivalent of AT&T eavesdropping on each of its customers' phone conversations, or of the postal service taking information from private correspondence.\"\n\nInstead of fight the case, Google agreed to change how it scans these emails \u2014 although scans for spam and malware would still occur during the delivery process as occurred before. The change will be seamless to customers, as it literally is a matter of milliseconds in processing time.\n\nIt's not clear whether Google was receiving any material benefit from the strategy \u2014 i.e. data from those non-Gmail users being used to serve more relevant ads across Google's widespread ad network. It also agreed to pay any legal costs related to the case and make a one-time payment of $2,000 to each of the class representatives.\n\nOther ad providers have not been so lucky. Yahoo was forced to settle over similar issues with its email-related ad-targeting practices, but ended up paying close to twice what Google had to in legal costs (about $4 million).\n\nGoogle declined to comment on the settlement, but offered that its efforts would result in concrete technical changes. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not respond to a request for comment as of press time.\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Google has agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit for $2.7m in relation to its email scanning practices. The lawsuit, Matera vs. Google, alleged that Google violated the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the California Information Privacy Act by scanning emails during the delivery process for advertising purposes. The case was settled after Google agreed to change its practices so that scanning occurs after the email is in the recipient's Gmail mailbox, rather than during delivery. Google has also agreed to pay any legal costs related to the case and make a one-time payment of $2,000 to each of the class representatives.", "Response B": "Based on the information provided, it appears that Google has agreed to change how it scans emails to deliver more relevant ads. Previously, the company scanned emails during the delivery process, which some people argued was a violation of their privacy. Google has now agreed to scan emails after they are available in the recipient's Gmail mailbox, which is expected to have minimal impact on users. The change is a result of a settlement in a court case, and Google has also agreed to pay legal costs and make a one-time payment to the class representatives. It is not clear if Google received any material benefit from the previous email-scanning practice. Other ad providers, such as Yahoo, have also faced similar legal issues related to their email-related ad-targeting practices."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 61, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "55519750fdf99b7f2114cc3e_64f9942cd1bb5ddb6f7c514c", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 10s "}}
