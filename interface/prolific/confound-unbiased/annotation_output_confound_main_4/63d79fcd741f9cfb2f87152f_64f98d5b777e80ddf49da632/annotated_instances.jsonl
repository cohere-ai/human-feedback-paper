Early market testing results show strong business model adoption potential for re/insurers across all lines of business, with estimated efficiency improvements that could lead to average annual administrative cost savings of $210 million.  B3i plans to fully penetrate the market by building on their current membership size, and is following a two-fold strategy of developing the first blockchain prototype into a market-ready product while continuing to recruit new members.
