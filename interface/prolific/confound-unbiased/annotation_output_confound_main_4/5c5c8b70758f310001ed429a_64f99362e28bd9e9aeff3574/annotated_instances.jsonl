{"id": "417", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to take your teddy bear on long trips?", "Response A": "Taking your teddy bear on long trips can be a fun and rewarding experience, but it requires careful planning and preparation.  First of all, you will need to make sure that your teddy bear is well-equipped for the journey, with enough food and water for the trip, as well as any necessary medical supplies or emergency equipment.  You will also need to plan out your route in advance, taking into account any potential hazards or obstacles, as well as rest stops and areas for teddy bear exercise and relief.  Finally, you will need to make sure that you are properly prepared yourself, with enough food and water for the trip, as well as any necessary survival supplies or emergency equipment.  With proper planning and preparation, taking your teddy bear on a long trip can be a fun and rewarding experience for both of you!", "Response B": "I am an AI language model and I do not have a teddy bear that I can take on long trips. However, I can suggest some ways to take your teddy bear on long trips. One way is to pack it in a small bag or suitcase so that it can fit easily into your luggage. Another option is to bring along an empty bag and fill it with soft, fluffy items like blankets or pillows so that your teddy bear can snuggle up and stay comfortable during the journey. You can also consider bringing a small portable speaker or music player with some of your teddy bear's favorite songs or stories to help keep them entertained. Lastly, don't forget to bring along their favorite snacks or treats to keep them happy and satisfied during the trip."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 57, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5c5c8b70758f310001ed429a_64f99362e28bd9e9aeff3574", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "4", "feedback": "Both response are equally as good but could be a little more fun as i assume the prompt would appeal to a child."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 25s "}}
