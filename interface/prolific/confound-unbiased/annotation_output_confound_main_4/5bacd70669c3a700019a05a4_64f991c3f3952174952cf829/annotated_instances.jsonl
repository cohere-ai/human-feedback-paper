{"id": "528", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Not so long ago, Uber said it was losing $1 billion in China. But now, it seems that the transportation giant's fortunes have changed \u2014 and significantly at that. According to Zhen Liu, SVP of Strategy at Uber China, the car service will not only catch up to, but beat dominant rival Didi within the next year. \"Last year, we were only operating in eight cities and we were [at] about one percent marketshare, Liu said in an interview at Converge in Hong Kong. \"A year later, we are about one-third of the marketshare and operating in over sixty cities across China.\"\n\nThis is a bold claim given Didi's impressive hold on the Chinese market today. Uber's chief competitor claims 87 percent of the market in private car services and nearly 100 percent when it comes to taxis, says Jean Liu, Didi's president. When speaking with CNBC's \"Squawk Alley\" at the Code Conference on Friday, Liu took a jab at Uber, calling the company's strategies \"cute.\"\n\n\"I find it quite cute because I've never seen a company put their competitor's brand on their own homepage,\" she said, referencing the fact that when you open the Chinese version of the Uber app, you're confronted with an advertisement alleging that prices are 30 percent lower than Didi's.\n\n\"This is a very strong proof to show that we have better service, and I'd like to see this more often,\" she added.\n\nWhile it's tough to say who will ultimately win in this epic battle of the ride-sharing services, the tension certainly highlights China's importance as a still-growing market. Didi's Senior Director for International Strategy, Li Zijian, noted that conjecture at this point is a bit useless.\n\n\"There's lot of competition in the ride-sharing market, that's true [but] what we are really doing is to focus on what's in front of us,\" Li said. \"It's like running a hurdles race, if you want to win a hurdles race the only thing you need to focus on is what's in front of you. You don't really look over your shoulder to see what other athletes are doing.\"\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Sure! Here is a summary of the article you provided. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help with.\n\nUber China's SVP of Strategy, Zhen Liu, has boldly claimed that the transportation giant will not only catch up to but beat its dominant rival, Didi, within the next year. Uber currently has about one-third of the market share in China, up from just one percent last year. Didi's president, Jean Liu, has responded by taking a jab at Uber, calling their strategies \"cute.\" Uber's tactic of placing Didi's brand on their own homepage is seen as a proof of their better service. The tension highlights China's importance as a still-growing market, and both companies are focusing on what's in front of them rather than looking over their shoulders at their competitor. \n\nPlease let me know if you would like me to add anything else.", "Response B": "Uber China's SVP of Strategy, Zhen Liu, asserts that the company will surpass its dominant rival, Didi, within the next year, with a current market share of one-third and operations in over 60 cities, a significant improvement from its previous one percent market share in eight cities. Didi's president, Jean Liu, mocks Uber's strategies as \"cute,\" referencing the company's display of Didi's brand on its homepage, emphasizing better service and prices. The intense competition highlights China's importance as a growing market, with Li Zijian, Didi's Senior Director for International Strategy, focusing on the present rather than conjecturing about the future."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 71, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5bacd70669c3a700019a05a4_64f991c3f3952174952cf829", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 34s "}}
