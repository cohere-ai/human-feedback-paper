Then, use a microfiber cloth or a specialized monitor cleaning solution to gently wipe the screen. Avoid using rough or abrasive materials that could scratch the surface. If there are stubborn smudges or stains, use a mixture of water and vinegar or a glass cleaner to clean them. Be careful not to apply too much pressure or apply the solution directly to the screen. Finally, dry the screen thoroughly with a dry cloth or microfiber cloth to avoid streaks or smudges.", "Response B": ""}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_50", "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5dc5da21d999de45a504651b_64f99412c35e8b77a2db4fa4", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "1"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 22s "}}
