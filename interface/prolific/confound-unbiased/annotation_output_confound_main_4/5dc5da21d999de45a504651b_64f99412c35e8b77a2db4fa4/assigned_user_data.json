Then, use a microfiber cloth or a specialized monitor cleaning solution to gently wipe the screen. Avoid using rough or abrasive materials that could scratch the surface. If there are stubborn smudges or stains, use a mixture of water and vinegar or a glass cleaner to clean them. Be careful not to apply too much pressure or apply the solution directly to the screen.
