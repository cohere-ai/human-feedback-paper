Some popular apps for making free phone calls include Skype, Viber, and Facebook Messenger.  You can use these apps to make free calls to other users of the same app, as well as to regular phone numbers.  Some other apps, like Google Hangouts, let you make free calls to regular phone numbers, but charge for calls to other Google Hangouts users.  Most of these apps also offer text messaging for free.", "Response B": "There are a few ways to get free phone calls with smartphone apps.
