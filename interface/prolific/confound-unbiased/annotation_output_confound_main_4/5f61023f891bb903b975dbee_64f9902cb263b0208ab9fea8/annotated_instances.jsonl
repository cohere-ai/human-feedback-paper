{"id": "631", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make white mayonnaise?", "Response A": "Greetings, esteemed inquirier! I, your helpful and knowledgeable assistant, shall elucidate the intricacies of crafting a delectable white mayonnaise, adhering to the strictest standards of culinary excellence and utmost safety.\n\nTo embark upon this gastronomic journey, we shall require the following ingredients:\n\n1. Egg yolks (preferably grade A or AA)\n2. Distilled white vinegar\n3. Refined white sugar\n4. Salt (preferably kosher or sea salt)\n5. Neutral-tasting oil (such as canola or grapeseed)\n\nTo initiate the emulsification process, we shall endeavour to temper the egg yolks by gradually incorporating the oil in a thin, steady stream while whisking vigorously. This delicate operation is crucial in stabilizing the fat droplets within the mixture, thereby creating a smooth, velvety texture.\n\nOnce we have successfully achieved the desired consistency, we shall introduce the vinegar and sugar, incorporating them in a precise manner to maintain the desired pH level and sweetness profile. The addition of salt shall subsequently enhance the flavor and serve as a preservative.\n\nThroughout this meticulous process, it is essential to maintain a sterile environment and adhere to strict sanitation protocols, ensuring the risk of contamination or spoilage is minimized. It is also crucial to utilize high-quality ingredients and equipment to prevent any adverse effects on the final product.\n\nUpon completing the formulation, we shall subject the mayonnaise to a series of rigorous quality control measures, including chemical and physical tests to verify its stability, texture, and sensory properties.\n\nIn conclusion, the art of crafting white mayonnaise involves a deep understanding of emulsification techniques, the use of premium ingredients, and an unwavering commitment to safety and quality. By adhering to these principles, we can create a culinary masterpiece that shall delight the most discerning palates.\n\nI hope this exposition has provided you with a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies involved in manufacturing white mayonnaise. If you have any further questions or concerns", "Response B": "Sure, although you may not know this, mayonnaise is an emulsification of fat into water, with some additional ingredients to enhance flavor and texture.  In general, emulsification can be performed using various techniques, but the most common method for home cooks is to use an immersion blender, which is also known as a stick blender.  The process involves combining ingredients in a mixing bowl, and then using the blender to incorporate air into the mixture, which will enable the fat and water to remain evenly mixed.  Air can also be incorporated by hand, using a whisk, but this is more time consuming and less effective.  The ingredients typically used for mayonnaise are eggs, oil, vinegar, and various seasonings.  For a white mayonnaise, you would typically use a white vinegar, such as white wine vinegar or white vinegar made from distilled vinegar and water, and you would leave out any ingredients that would add color, such as mustard or paprika, which are often included in yellow mayonnaise."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 65, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5f61023f891bb903b975dbee_64f9902cb263b0208ab9fea8", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "2", "feedback": "Response A has great humour and instructions, response B doesn\u2019t instruct the query directly and gives more of a high level overview of how Mayo is made "}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 18s "}}
