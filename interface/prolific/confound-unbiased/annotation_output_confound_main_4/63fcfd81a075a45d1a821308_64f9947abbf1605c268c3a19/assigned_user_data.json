I can tell you that it is important to make your payments on time and to try to keep your balances low, but I don't know much beyond that. I would recommend that you speak to a financial advisor or planner if you are looking for more information.", "Response B": "Maintaining good credit involves a few key steps. First, make sure you pay all of your bills on time to avoid late payments and missed payments. Second, keep your credit utilization low by only using a small amount of your available credit at any given time. Third, avoid opening too many new credit accounts at once, as this can negatively impact your credit score. It's also important to monitor your credit report regularly to ensure that there are no errors or fraudulent activity. Finally, be patient and consistent in your efforts to maintain good credit, as it takes time to build and improve your credit score."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 51, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to maintain good credit?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            I'm sorry, but I don't know much about credit scores or how to maintain good credit.
