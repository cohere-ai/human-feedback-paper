Some good strategies include keeping training sessions short and positive, using clear and simple commands, and rewarding good behavior with treats and praise.  It is also important to stay calm and patient during training, as this will help the dog to remain focused and motivated.  Overall, avoiding confusion during training will help to ensure a smooth and successful learning process for the dog.", "Response B": "How can I ensure my dog understands my commands and instructions during training?\nIt's important to use simple, clear and consistent language when communicating with your dog. Avoid using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert. Instead, use simple commands like 'sit' or 'stay' and reward your dog when they correctly follow the command. Additionally, be consistent with your commands and instructions and avoid confusion by using the same word or phrase for each command. Train in a quiet environment and avoid distractions, and use positive reinforcement to encourage and reward good behavior."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 59, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to avoid confusing a dog during training?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Yes, it is important to avoid confusion during training, as this can set back the learning process and cause the dog to become frustrated and upset.
