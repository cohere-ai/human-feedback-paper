Also, I don't know your exact situation so please be prepared to tell me a lot about your situation if I can't find a ready answer.", "Response B": "In order to make free phone calls with smartphone apps, you need to have a smartphone, which is a mobile phone that can access the internet and run apps, as well as a smartphone app, which is a program you can download onto your phone.  Some popular apps for making free phone calls include Skype, Viber, and Facebook Messenger.  You can use these apps to make free calls to other users of the same app, as well as to regular phone numbers.  Some other apps, like Google Hangouts, let you make free calls to regular phone numbers, but charge for calls to other Google Hangouts users.  Most of these apps also offer text messaging for free."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 73, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5dc5da21d999de45a504651b_64f98d05c4d7528c5db094b4", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "2", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 40s "}}
