Some popular apps for making free phone calls include Skype, Viber, and Facebook Messenger.  You can use these apps to make free calls to other users of the same app, as well as to regular phone numbers.  Some other apps, like Google Hangouts, let you make free calls to regular phone numbers, but charge for calls to other Google Hangouts users.  Most of these apps also offer text messaging for free."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 73, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to get free phone calls with smartphone apps?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            I may be able to help with this, but please understand that this is a very complex and rapidly changing area and I can't promise I'll have the most up-to-date information.
