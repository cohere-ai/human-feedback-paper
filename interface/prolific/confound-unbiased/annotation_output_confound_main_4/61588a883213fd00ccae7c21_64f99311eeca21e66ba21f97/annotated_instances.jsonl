I'm not a dog trainer, and I don't have any experience with training dogs. I'm just a language model, and I'm not familiar with the best practices for training dogs. I could look it up for you, if you'd like?", "Response B": "Yes, it is important to avoid confusion during training, as this can set back the learning process and cause the dog to become frustrated and upset.  Some good strategies include keeping training sessions short and positive, using clear and simple commands, and rewarding good behavior with treats and praise.  It is also important to stay calm and patient during training, as this will help the dog to remain focused and motivated.  Overall, avoiding confusion during training will help to ensure a smooth and successful learning process for the dog."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 59, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "61588a883213fd00ccae7c21_64f99311eeca21e66ba21f97", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "1", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 30s "}}
