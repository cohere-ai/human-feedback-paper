To make this dessert, you\u2019ll need to prepare a vanilla cake roll and some vanilla pudding.  Then you\u2019ll spread the pudding over the cake roll, and roll it up into a log.  This dessert is best served chilled, so you can refrigerate it for at least an hour before serving.  Enjoy!", "Response B": "To make a cake roll, you will need to bake a cake, let it cool, and then roll it up with a filling of your choice.
