{"id": "610", "input_text": {"Prompt": "KUALA LUMPUR (May 4): Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd's (ANZ) chief hinted that 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) concerns had an indirect impact on ANZ's stake in AMMB Holdings Bhd, The Australian reported today.\n\nAMMB is also known as AmBank.\n\nThe Australian quoted ANZ chief executive Shayne Elliott as saying it was unquestionable that 1MDB' debt concerns and the Malaysian economy had a broad-base impact on Malaysian asset valuations. AMMB's share price was no exception, according to him.\n\n\"Has the 1MDB and the Malaysian economy and all those situations, impacted the AmBank share price? Unquestionably.\"\n\n\"It's impacted the valuation of lots of things in Malaysia, so it will have had an impact. But it's not a direct response to that,\" Elliott was quoted as saying in a press conference yesterday (May 3), during the announcement of ANZ's first-half financials.\n\nANZ via ANZ Funds Pty Ltd is the largest shareholder in AMMB, with a 23.78% stake.\n\nAt Bursa Malaysia today, AMMB shares rose eight sen or 1.8% at 12:30pm to RM4.56 for a market value of RM13.72 billion.\n\nAMMB's current share price compares with the stock's one-year intraday high at RM6.21 seen on May 5, 2015.\n\nIn Australia yesterday, Elliott said there was \"no 1MDB issue\" for the ANZ board to discuss.\n\n\"We don't have an exposure to 1MDB. In terms of our partnership or the minority investment that we have in (AmBank's holding company) AMMB, all of those stakes get discussed regularly,\" he said.\n\nYesterday, ANZ said it incurred a A$260 million (about RM1.03 billion) impairment for its investment in AMMB during the first half ended March 31, 2016 (1HFY16).\n\nANZ told the Australian bourse that the AMMB impairment was among reasons for ANZ's weaker 1HFY16 financials, compared to a year earlier. During 1HFY16, ANZ said statutory profit after tax fell to A$2.74 billion, from A$3.51 billion.\n\nAt the press conference, Elliott said ANZ had cut its investment value in AMMB by almost 20% or A$260 million.\n\nThe Australian reported that \"ANZ chief financial officer Graeme Hodges refused to say how much money AmBank had on loan to 1MDB.\"\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Based on the provided text, it appears that there may be a connection between the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) scandal and the performance of AMMB Holdings Bhd (AmBank), as suggested by the CEO of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ). However, the exact nature of this connection is not fully clear, and the ANZ chief financial officer refused to provide specific information on the amount of loans given to 1MDB by AmBank.\n\nIt is worth noting that ANZ has incurred an impairment of A$260 million for its investment in AMMB during the first half of the financial year ending March 31, 2016, which may be related to the 1MDB concerns. However, the impact of these concerns on AmBank's share price is not entirely clear, as the share price has fluctuated over time and is currently trading at RM4.56, up eight sen or 1.8% from the previous day.\n\nIn light of these developments, it is important to exercise caution and uncertainty when discussing the potential impact of 1MDB concerns on AmBank's performance. Further research and information may be necessary to fully understand the situation and any potential risks or implications.", "Response B": "ANZ chief executive Shayne Elliott said that 1MDB concerns indirectly impacted ANZ's stake in AMMB Holdings Bhd due to broad-based impact on Malaysian asset valuations. AmBank's share price was no exception.
