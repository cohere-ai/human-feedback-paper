For the 'chain' application, it should be legally regulated.\"\n\nEarlier this week, three major Chinese telecom operators launched a blockchain research group for building a \"next-generation telecommunication network.\" China will also lead an international research group on the standardization of the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technology, as Cointelegraph reported July 18.\n\nChina has also recently downplayed blockchain tech, as the head of the international department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission warned against \"mythologizing\" blockchain technology in mid-July.\n\nAs China was the first country to institute blanket a ban on Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) and exchanges, Cointelegraph reports that the country has some difficulties with the decentralized and liberal freedoms that comes from blockchain and cryptocurrencies.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The Academy of Information and Communications Technology and Tencent Holdings have released a report discussing the impact of blockchain technology on traditional financial services.
