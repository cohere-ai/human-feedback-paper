The use of digital devices can actually increase stress levels and affect mental health.

Find an exercise that you enjoy, such as walking, jogging, or yoga, and make it a regular part of your routine.\n2. Meditation: Mindfulness meditation can help calm your mind and reduce stress.

Connect with others: Spend time with loved ones, engage in hobbies, or join a community group to build social connections and reduce stress.\n4. Get enough sleep: Adequate sleep is essential for managing stress and improving overall health. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night.\n5.
