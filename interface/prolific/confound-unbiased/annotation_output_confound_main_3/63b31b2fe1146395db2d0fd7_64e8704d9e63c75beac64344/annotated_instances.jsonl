Can you please rephrase your question?", "Response B": "Cats can be really tricky when it comes to their diets, and they can get into some unhealthy patterns if you\u2019re not careful.  If you think your cat is malnourished, or \u201cunderweight\u201d, it\u2019s important to take the right steps to help your cat.  One thing that\u2019s really important is to reduce stress in your cat\u2019s life, and make sure your cat is getting enough good quality food.  A healthy, happy cat is a cat that\u2019s less likely to develop an eating disorder.  You can also try a special cat food that\u2019s designed for cats that are underweight, and there are also a number of cat supplements you can add to your cat\u2019s food to help it gain weight.  There are also veterinarians who can help you with this."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 83, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63b31b2fe1146395db2d0fd7_64e8704d9e63c75beac64344", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "1", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 6s "}}
