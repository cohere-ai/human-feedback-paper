Last month, the ride-hailing app lost a court battle against Transport for London (TfL), which had pushed for the new rules to be introduced. The rules, which would require drivers to take a written test, could mean around 33,000 private hire drivers out of a total of around 110,000 operating in London would be unable to renew their licences.", "Response B": "Uber is appealing a recent court decision that would require its London drivers to pass additional English language tests.  The proposed rules, which have not yet been implemented, would require drivers to pass a written test in order to renew their licenses, and Uber estimates that this would disqualify tens of thousands of its drivers.  The company argues that the rules are discriminatory and would significantly harm its business in London.  There has been increasing regulatory pressure on Uber in recent months, following a string of scandals and controversies involving the company."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 86, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5ae219585b920d0001410957_64e8714fe9002f054795a7f0", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 58s "}}
