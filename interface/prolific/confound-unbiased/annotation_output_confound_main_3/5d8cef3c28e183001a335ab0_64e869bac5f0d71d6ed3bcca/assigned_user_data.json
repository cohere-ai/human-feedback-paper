One way is to use a DNA testing kit, which can be purchased online or at some pet stores. These kits typically include a swab that you can use to collect a sample of your dog's DNA.

There are several ways to test dog DNA and analyze parentage, including DNA sequencing, DNA microarrays, and DNA genotyping.\n\nOne of the most common methods for dog DNA testing and parentage analysis is DNA sequencing. This method involves sequencing the DNA of the dog in question and comparing it to the DNA of other dogs to determine similarities and differences. This can help to identify genetic mutations and variations that may be relevant to the dog's health and well-being.\n\nAnother method for dog DNA testing and parentage analysis is DNA microarrays. This method involves using a microarray to compare the DNA of the dog in question to the DNA of other dogs. This can help to identify genetic variations and mutations that may be relevant to the dog's health and well-being.\n\nFinally, DNA genotyping is another method for dog DNA testing and parentage analysis.
