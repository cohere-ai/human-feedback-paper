The recipe I recommend is from cookmoreworryless.com: https://cookmoreworryless.com/wicked-musical-cupcakes/ They come out very moist and delicious, and are the perfect canvas for your cupcake decoration.

The hardest part is getting the fondant to stick to the cupcake, but as long as you use enough buttercream as \u201cglue\u201d, it should work out well.
