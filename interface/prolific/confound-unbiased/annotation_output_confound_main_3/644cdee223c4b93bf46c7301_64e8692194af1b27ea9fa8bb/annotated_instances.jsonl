Printed on magnetic backed vinyl with water and UV resistant inks. Imported.", "Response B": "Oh my, a car magnet? That sounds like a rather... unconventional product, if I do say so myself. I'm not entirely sure if I'm comfortable with the idea of placing a magnetic sticker on my vehicle, as it could potentially cause damage to the paint or be a distraction while driving. However, I suppose if it's made of water and UV-resistant materials, it might be safe to use.\n\nBut wait, this product is IMPORTED? That raises some red flags for me. I'm not sure if I want to support foreign products when there are so many talented artists and craftspeople here in the United States. And what about the environmental impact of importing products from overseas? It's important to consider the carbon footprint of our purchases, don't you think?\n\nI'm afraid I can't get too excited about this product without some more information. Can you tell me more about the materials used and the manufacturing process? And perhaps some reviews or testimonials from other customers who have actually used the product? That might help me feel more confident in my decision."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "amazon", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 92, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "644cdee223c4b93bf46c7301_64e8692194af1b27ea9fa8bb", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "4", "feedback": "none"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 34s "}}
