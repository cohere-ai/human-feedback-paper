The study further comments:\n\n\"In addition to digital currency, the characteristics of the blockchain can play a big role in the fields of payment and settlement, supply chain finance, securities trading, insurance, and credit reporting.\"\n\nDuring the process of applying blockchain, the report notes, it is necessary to differentiate between the \"coin\" application and the \"chain\" application, presumably a reference to blockchain tech's basis for most cryptocurrencies:\n\n\"For the 'coin' application, the financial risk should be strictly guarded. For the 'chain' application, it should be legally regulated.\"\n\nEarlier this week, three major Chinese telecom operators launched a blockchain research group for building a \"next-generation telecommunication network.\" China will also lead an international research group on the standardization of the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technology, as Cointelegraph reported July 18.\n\nChina has also recently downplayed blockchain tech, as the head of the international department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission warned against \"mythologizing\" blockchain technology in mid-July.\n\nAs China was the first country to institute blanket a ban on Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) and exchanges, Cointelegraph reports that the country has some difficulties with the decentralized and liberal freedoms that comes from blockchain and cryptocurrencies.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The Chinese Academy of Information and Communications Technology and Tencent Holdings have produced a report on the impact of blockchain on the transformation of traditional financial services, saying that blockchain technology will further enhance the transparency of financial transactions, strengthen the flexibility of system operation and automate processes.
