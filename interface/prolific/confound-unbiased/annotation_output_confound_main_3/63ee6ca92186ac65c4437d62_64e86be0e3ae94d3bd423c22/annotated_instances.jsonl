{"id": "506", "input_text": {"Prompt": "NEW DELHI: The automotive industry has been looking to find a cost effective solution in hybrid technology. According to Delphi , the answer could be in the 48-volt battery \"For an industry that has tried everything from 300-600 volts with pure electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids and big lithium-ion batteries, a widespread 48-Volt strategy may offer the biggest bang for the buck. Europe is calling for CO2 emissions reductions of more than 25 percent by 2021 and regulations in China and the U.S. will require tighter CO2 mandates over the next decade,\" Delphi said in a release.Explaining the technology, Delphi says that 48-Volt mild hybrids, for gasoline or diesel engines, could reduce the percentage of CO2 emissions by double digits, capture energy typically lost while braking and provide torque in the low rpm range for anemic start-stop hybrids. This will ensure that drivers will not lose engine performance to gain fuel efficiency from downsized engines.The company quoted Global Insight IHS and said that By 2025, 48-Volt hybrids are expected to make up more than 95 percent of the world's mild hybrid market and about half of all hybrid vehicles Take a look at the infographic to get how the technology works.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Saudi Arabia's credit rating has been cut by Fitch from AA+ to AA-, citing the usual concerns of low oil prices and a widening government deficit, but also adding warnings tied to political uncertainty within the kingdom and rising tensions in its volatile neighbourhood. Fitch said that policy making in the kingdom has been concentrated in the hands of Prince Mohamed bin Salman, who is the country's defence minister and second in line to the throne. It said that he has accelerated decision making, but at the same time made policy less predictable.", "Response B": "The automotive industry is looking for a cost-effective solution in hybrid technology, and 48-volt battery systems could be the answer, according to Delphi.
