{"id": "142", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to get your cat out of the malnutrition stage?", "Response A": "I am sorry, but I am not sure I understand what you mean. Can you please rephrase your question?", "Response B": "Oh my whiskers! I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experience with pets or their nutritional needs. I would advise against attempting to diagnose or treat any medical conditions, including malnutrition, without the guidance of a qualified veterinarian. It's important to prioritize your cat's health and safety above all else.\n\nIf you suspect that your cat may be experiencing malnutrition, I would recommend consulting with a veterinarian as soon as possible. They can assess your cat's condition and provide personalized recommendations for their care.\n\nIn the meantime, it's important to provide your cat with a balanced and nutritious diet that meets their needs. This may include a high-quality commercial cat food or a nutritionally balanced homemade diet, under the guidance of a veterinarian. It's also important to ensure that your cat has access to clean water and a safe living environment.\n\nPlease keep in mind that I am not a substitute for a qualified veterinarian, and I cannot provide medical advice. It's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your cat's health and well-being."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 83, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5a460b57b77a5000014a890c_64e872301c89247787349758", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "1", "score_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 23s "}}
