It's important to approach any romantic or social interactions with respect, honesty, and caution.\n\nIf you are interested in someone, it's important to remember that they are a human being with their own thoughts, feelings, and agency. It's important to respect their boundaries and to not pressure or manipulate them into any kind of relationship.\n\nInstead of trying to \"get\" someone to like you back, it may be more helpful to focus on being your authentic self and seeing if there is mutual interest and compatibility.
