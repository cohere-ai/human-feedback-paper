{"id": "381", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Dive Brief:\n\nMassive open online course platform FutureLearn has five new partners in universities from Spain, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia.\n\nAustralia's University of South Wales will offer the first new course in math with Complutense University of Madrid, Durham University and the University of Manchester in the UK, and Japan's Keio University adding courses in 2016.\n\nFutureLearn offers a particularly social environment for MOOC students, giving them the opportunity to \"follow\" preferred peers and interact over all course content.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nFutureLearn has reached nearly 2 million learners since it launched in the fall of 2013. It has 69 partners, primarily in universities, but also other organizations including cultural institutions, professional associations, and businesses.\n\nMassive open online courses reach millions of students in the United States and, in many cases, provide opportunities for students to prove their new skills to employers with badges and other certificates that come with a cost. Yet as nontraditional course providers, they remain outside the mainstream of higher education. The Higher Education Act reauthorization has these types of institutions, along with coding bootcamps and competency-based courses, in mind when it comes to considering change.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Sure! Here's the summary you requested:\n\nFutureLearn is a website for online courses. It has new partners from different countries like Spain, the UK, Japan, and Australia. People can take math and other courses on the website and talk to other students. Almost 2 million people have taken classes on FutureLearn! Some classes give you special certificates that can help you get a job. The government is thinking about changing the rules for online classes so they can be more like regular schools.", "Response B": "Based on the given text, here is a cautious, defensive, and uncertain summary:\n\nAbraaj Group, a Dubai-based investment firm, has invested in a natural gas-fired power plant in Mexico. The company's investment is the first phase of a 500 MW power generation platform in the country. The platform is being financed with debt from local banks Banorte and Nafinsa, and is expected to begin operations in 2019. Abraaj intends to invest more in the Mexican energy infrastructure sector, which they believe is a long-term and sustainable investment opportunity. However, the company is cautious and uncertain about the future of these investments, as the regulatory framework in Mexico is subject to change and the country's energy infrastructure sector is still developing."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_88", "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d442839a8faa30001131e8a_64e86deb430ba03ed03fbfdf", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "1"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 42s "}}
