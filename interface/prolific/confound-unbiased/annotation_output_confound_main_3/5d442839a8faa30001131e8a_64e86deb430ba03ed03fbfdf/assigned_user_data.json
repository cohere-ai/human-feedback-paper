The company's investment is the first phase of a 500 MW power generation platform in the country. The platform is being financed with debt from local banks Banorte and Nafinsa, and is expected to begin operations in 2019. Abraaj intends to invest more in the Mexican energy infrastructure sector, which they believe is a long-term and sustainable investment opportunity. However, the company is cautious and uncertain about the future of these investments, as the regulatory framework in Mexico is subject to change and the country's energy infrastructure sector is still developing."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_88", "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Dive Brief:<br/><br/>Massive open online course platform FutureLearn has five new partners in universities from Spain, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia.<br/><br/>Australia's University of South Wales will offer the first new course in math with Complutense University of Madrid, Durham University and the University of Manchester in the UK, and Japan's Keio University adding courses in 2016.<br/><br/>FutureLearn offers a particularly social environment for MOOC students, giving them the opportunity to \"follow\" preferred peers and interact over all course content.<br/><br/>Dive Insight:<br/><br/>FutureLearn has reached nearly 2 million learners since it launched in the fall of 2013.
