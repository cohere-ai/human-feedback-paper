The company used giant cranes to lift a fuel handling machine, which was destroyed when a quake-sparked tsunami sent some of the plant's reactors into meltdown in March 2011.  Tepco described the delicate operation as a critical step toward clearing highly radioactive spent fuel rods from the cooling pool inside its badly damaged Reactor number 3.
