If you notice any of these behaviors, it might be a good idea to talk to your employee and see if there is anything you can do to help them.", "Response B": "Hello! I can help you with that. Here are some signs that an employee might be looking for a new job:\n\n1. They start looking at job listings online.\n2. They talk to other people about job opportunities.\n3. They seem more interested in their own work and want to do better.\n4. They start saying goodbye to coworkers and saying they might leave soon.\n\nRemember, it's important to be respectful and not accuse someone of looking for a new job if they're not. It's okay if they want to stay and work hard!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 87, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d4e206538bcee681f61e8d_64e86913d6523c3ca2c64363", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "1"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 40s "}}
