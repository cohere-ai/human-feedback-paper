The study further comments:\n\n\"In addition to digital currency, the characteristics of the blockchain can play a big role in the fields of payment and settlement, supply chain finance, securities trading, insurance, and credit reporting.\"\n\nDuring the process of applying blockchain, the report notes, it is necessary to differentiate between the \"coin\" application and the \"chain\" application, presumably a reference to blockchain tech's basis for most cryptocurrencies:\n\n\"For the 'coin' application, the financial risk should be strictly guarded. For the 'chain' application, it should be legally regulated.\"\n\nEarlier this week, three major Chinese telecom operators launched a blockchain research group for building a \"next-generation telecommunication network.\" China will also lead an international research group on the standardization of the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technology, as Cointelegraph reported July 18.\n\nChina has also recently downplayed blockchain tech, as the head of the international department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission warned against \"mythologizing\" blockchain technology in mid-July.\n\nAs China was the first country to institute blanket a ban on Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) and exchanges, Cointelegraph reports that the country has some difficulties with the decentralized and liberal freedoms that comes from blockchain and cryptocurrencies.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Blockchain has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of the financial services industry. It can enhance the transparency of financial transactions, automate processes, and strengthen the flexibility of system operations. It can be applied to digital currency, payment and settlement, supply chain finance, securities trading, insurance, and credit reporting. Certain applications of blockchain, such as those involving digital currency, should be strictly regulated, while others should be legally regulated.", "Response B": "The Academy of Information and Communications Technology and Tencent Holdings have released a report discussing the impact of blockchain technology on traditional financial services. The report highlights eight core conclusions for the implementation of blockchain in the financial sector, including enhanced transparency, automated processes, and improved record-keeping. The study emphasizes the importance of differentiating between \"coin\" and \"chain\" applications, with stricter financial risk management for the former and legal regulation for the latter.\n\nChina has been actively exploring the potential of blockchain technology, with three major telecom operators launching a research group for building a \"next-generation telecommunication network\" and China leading an international research group on the standardization of IoT and blockchain technology. However, the country has also expressed some reservations about the decentralized and liberal freedoms associated with blockchain and cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn conclusion, the report provides valuable insights into the potential of blockchain technology in the financial sector, while also acknowledging the need for careful risk management and legal regulation. China's ongoing exploration of blockchain technology highlights the country's commitment to harnessing innovation while maintaining regulatory oversight."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 93, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d49d17b3dad1f0001e2aba1_64e86dd462ee108fa4423c18", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "2", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 35s "}}
