The EU rules state that a driver posted temporarily away from home should be 'guaranteed' the host nation's 'minimum rates of pay' and conditions, but companies can exploit loopholes in the law. It is clear that this way of treating drivers is widespread and not just within the IKEA supply chain, but also in those of several other big household names. Legal action is now being taken against some of IKEA's contractors. The BBC investigation found that drivers' pay was not consistent with Dutch wages law, and conditions for the drivers were an 'inhumane state of affairs', contrary to EU law. IKEA stated that it takes the testimonies from the drivers 'very seriously' and is 'saddened' by them. The company said it puts 'strict demands' on its suppliers concerning wages, working conditions, and following applicable legislation, and audits them regularly to check compliance.", "Response B": "Okay! Here is a summary of the article using short words and simple language:\n\nSome people who drive big trucks to move things for companies like IKEA are not being treated well. They have to live in their trucks for months at a time and don't get paid much. This is not fair and is against the law. The companies they work for are supposed to pay them the same as other people in the country where they are working, but they are not doing that. Some courts are now making the companies pay the drivers more money because it is not right to treat them this way. IKEA is working to make sure the companies they work with are treating their drivers well."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 89, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63268e60fbfb9c73671faa37_64e866b54eb22051a2184187", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "2"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 53s "}}
