Matt Bevin has committed to getting computer science into every school, if only through online instruction at first, and Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said his state is well on its way to meeting Code.org's three goals after requiring high school coding classes and investing $5 million in teacher training.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nHour of Code events are one way to introduce students to coding and computer science more generally, but they are not nearly enough to prepare students for technology majors in college or for future jobs. A key criticism of the push to teach coding is that it doesn't provide students with computer science fundamentals that teach them the logic behind the skill. That's, ostensibly, what required high school courses could delve into.\n\nAlternative post-secondary programs are having some of the same problems in finding a balance. Coding bootcamps have sprung up to provide adults with retraining opportunities that make them marketable to tech employers, but there is concern crash courses in programming languages that are popular now won't truly prepare people for the field. When new languages are created, computer scientists who know the logic behind them are better equipped to adapt. As high schools strive to prepare students for careers as well as college, this should be kept top of mind.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "A recent report from Code.org, the organisation that promotes computer science education, has highlighted that US state governors are increasingly being urged to increase access to coding courses. The report states that, as the popularity of coding grows, the demand for computer science professionals is expected to rise significantly in the next decade, and that, in order to meet this demand, the US government must ensure that all children have access to computer science education from an early age. This means that coding courses should be made mandatory in schools and that funding should be made available for teacher training to ensure that schools have the necessary staff to teach these courses. Furthermore, the report argues that the government should invest in the development of computer science standards to ensure that all children receive a high-quality education in this area.", "Response B": "Students at the National Governors Association meeting have taught governors how to code as part of a national campaign to increase access to computer science courses.
