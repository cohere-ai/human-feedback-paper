If you notice any of these behaviors, it might be a good idea to talk to your employee and see if there is anything you can do to help them.", "Response B": "Some signs that an employee may be looking for a new job include: decreased productivity, lack of engagement, frequent absences, increased job searching activity, increased nervousness or agitation, and changes in communication patterns.
