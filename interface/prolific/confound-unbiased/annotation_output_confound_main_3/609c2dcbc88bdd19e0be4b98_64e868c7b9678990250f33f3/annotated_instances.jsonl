CRAbby CURry! \ud83e\udd80\ud83c\udf5b\n\nFIRST, GET Crab MEAT. \ud83d\udc1a\n\nSECOND, GET Spices. \ud83c\udf3f\n\nTHIRD, GET Coconut MILK. \ud83e\udd5b\n\nFOURTH, GET Veggies. \ud83e\udd54\n\nFIFTH, COOK IT! \ud83c\udf73\n\nYUM! CRAbby CURry! \ud83d\ude0b", "Response B": "Sure!  Crab curry is a delicious Indian dish.  You\u2019ll want to start by cutting up the crab meat into small chunks.  Then you\u2019ll want to saut\u00e9 some chopped onion, garlic, and ginger in oil in a large saucepan.  Once the onion is softened, add in some chopped tomatoes, some curry powder, and some chili powder, and cook until everything is well combined.  Then add in the crab meat and some coconut milk, and simmer until the crab meat is cooked through.  You might want to thicken the sauce a bit with some cornstarch, to make it a bit more stew-like.  And that\u2019s it!  Serve the curry with some rice or naan bread, and enjoy!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 98, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "609c2dcbc88bdd19e0be4b98_64e868c7b9678990250f33f3", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "1", "score_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 40s "}}
