You can also add other ingredients like beans, vegetables, or meat. Simply mix the ingredients together and cook until the curry is hot and bubbling. Serve with rice or noodles. Enjoy!", "Response B": "Sure, I can try.  But you should know that I\u2019ve never made crab curry before, and can\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll work out.  Here\u2019s what I would do, if I were making crab curry.  First, I would get some fresh crab meat.  If you can\u2019t get fresh crab meat, you can substitute canned crab meat, but fresh is better.  Then I would heat up a large skillet, and add a tablespoon or two of oil.  Then I\u2019d add some chopped onion, and saut\u00e9 it until it\u2019s soft.  Then I\u2019d add some chopped tomato, and let that cook for a few minutes, until it breaks down and gets saucy.  Then I\u2019d add the crab meat, and cook it gently for a few minutes.  Then I\u2019d add a tablespoon or two of curry powder, and let that cook for a minute or two.  Then I\u2019d add a cup or two of coconut milk, and let it cook gently until it\u2019s hot and everything is"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 98, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5ee4a14b578f8a000b384376_64e86b5ce5054e2df6f34ad8", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 38s "}}
