At the time, speculation was rife that foul play was artificially inflating prices and that the asset would soon collapse.\n\nLike Dash before it, however, it appears ETH is considerably more resilient than many thought.\n\nAmid the hype, entrepreneur Tuur Demeester highlighted what he called \"interesting metrics\" showing the daily investment sums required \"in theory\" to keep Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin prices stable.\n\nIn theory. Miners may be hoarding, or may sell at pre-agreed (lower) priced. Still interesting metric. https://t.co/RLs0VtwtYp \u2014 Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) May 4, 2017\n\nFurther surprise climbers meanwhile include Stellar network's Lumens, which in June is due to complete its distribution phase and is up 65 percent from Thursday.\n\nDogecoin also gained 20 percent over the same period in what appears to be a reactionary move to overall market gains.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Ethereum has finally reached $100 per token, and the cryptocurrency's price is expected to rise further.", "Response B": "Ethereum surpassed $100 per token for the first time in its history as altcoins staged another rally.
