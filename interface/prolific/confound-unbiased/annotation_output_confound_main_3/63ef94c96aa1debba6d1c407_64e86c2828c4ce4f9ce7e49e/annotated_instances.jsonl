Here's a recipe for a classic chocolate cupcake with a fun twist.\n\nIngredients:\n\n- 1 cup all-purpose flour\n- 1 cup sugar\n- 2 teaspoons baking soda\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder\n- 1 cup milk\n- 1/2 cup vegetable oil\n- 2 large eggs\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\nFor the frosting:\n\n- 1 cup butter, softened\n- 1/2 cup sugar\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.

Add vanilla extract and beat until combined. Spread frosting over cooled cupcakes.\n\nEnjoy!", "Response B": "Sure, I\u2019ve actually made these before and have some guidance to offer! First you\u2019ll need to make the cupcakes themselves. The recipe I recommend is from cookmoreworryless.com: https://cookmoreworryless.com/wicked-musical-cupcakes/ They come out very moist and delicious, and are the perfect canvas for your cupcake decoration. Next you can follow this video tutorial from the Cupcake Collective to create the beautiful flower cupcake toppers: https://youtu.be/kUv1VQk2QjA. The hardest part is getting the fondant to stick to the cupcake, but as long as you use enough buttercream as \u201cglue\u201d, it should work out well. Finally, I recommend ordering these edible glitter sheets to add some sparkle to the beautiful roses you\u2019ll create: https://amzn.to/3lz0h9u. I hope this helps you make some beautiful cupcakes and have a great time at your Wicked musical event!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 82, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63ef94c96aa1debba6d1c407_64e86c2828c4ce4f9ce7e49e", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "1"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 17s "}}
