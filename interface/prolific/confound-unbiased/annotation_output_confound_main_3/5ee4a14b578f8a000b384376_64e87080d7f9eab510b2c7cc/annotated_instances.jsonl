{"id": "228", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Dive Brief:\n\nA group of students taught governors how to code at the annual National Governors Association meeting amid a national push to increase access to computer science courses.\n\nEdTech: Focus on K-12 reports Code.org hosted the Hour of Code session, aiming to convince governors to require high schools to offer at least one computer science course, to fund teacher development to increase the number of qualified computer science teachers in their states, and to develop K-12 computer science standards.\n\nKentucky Gov. Matt Bevin has committed to getting computer science into every school, if only through online instruction at first, and Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said his state is well on its way to meeting Code.org's three goals after requiring high school coding classes and investing $5 million in teacher training.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nHour of Code events are one way to introduce students to coding and computer science more generally, but they are not nearly enough to prepare students for technology majors in college or for future jobs. A key criticism of the push to teach coding is that it doesn't provide students with computer science fundamentals that teach them the logic behind the skill. That's, ostensibly, what required high school courses could delve into.\n\nAlternative post-secondary programs are having some of the same problems in finding a balance. Coding bootcamps have sprung up to provide adults with retraining opportunities that make them marketable to tech employers, but there is concern crash courses in programming languages that are popular now won't truly prepare people for the field. When new languages are created, computer scientists who know the logic behind them are better equipped to adapt. As high schools strive to prepare students for careers as well as college, this should be kept top of mind.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Code.org hosted a session at the National Governors Association meeting to encourage governors to support efforts to increase access to computer science courses in schools. Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin has committed to introducing computer science into every school in the state, while Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said his state is on track to meeting Code.org's goals of requiring high school coding classes and investing in teacher training. Critics have argued that efforts to teach coding do not provide students with computer science fundamentals, and that alternative post-secondary programs such as coding bootcamps may not be enough to prepare students for careers in the field.", "Response B": "A recent report from Code.org, the organisation that promotes computer science education, has highlighted that US state governors are increasingly being urged to increase access to coding courses. The report states that, as the popularity of coding grows, the demand for computer science professionals is expected to rise significantly in the next decade, and that, in order to meet this demand, the US government must ensure that all children have access to computer science education from an early age. This means that coding courses should be made mandatory in schools and that funding should be made available for teacher training to ensure that schools have the necessary staff to teach these courses. Furthermore, the report argues that the government should invest in the development of computer science standards to ensure that all children receive a high-quality education in this area."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 80, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5ee4a14b578f8a000b384376_64e87080d7f9eab510b2c7cc", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 42s "}}
