Then I\u2019d add a cup or two of coconut milk, and let it cook gently until it\u2019s hot and everything is", "Response B": "Sure, to make crab curry you'll need the following ingredients:\n\n-1 lb of crab meat\n-2 tbsp of olive oil\n-2 tbsp of red curry paste\n-1 cup of coconut milk\n-1 tsp of salt\n-1 tsp of black pepper\n-1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper\n\nYou'll also need:\n\n-1 medium onion\n-1 medium red bell pepper\n-1 stalk of celery\n-2 cloves of garlic\n\nFirst, you'll heat up the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
