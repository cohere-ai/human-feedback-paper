{"80": {"id": "80", "text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make sloe gin?", "Response A": "To make sloe gin, you will need 450 grams of sloe berries, 70 grams of caster sugar, and 1 liter of gin. Rinse the sloe berries and prick them with a skewer. Place them in a sterilized jar or bottle and add the caster sugar. Pour the gin over the berries and sugar, seal the bottle or jar, and shake well. Store the bottle in a cool, dark place for 2 to 3 months, shaking it occasionally. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve or muslin cloth to remove the berries and any sediment. Serve chilled.", "Response B": "Hmm. I\u2019ve never made it before, so let me look online. It looks like there are a few different recipes. The first one I found suggests putting the sloe berries in a jar with some sugar and leaving it for a few weeks."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 125, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to make sloe gin?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            To make sloe gin, you will need 450 grams of sloe berries, 70 grams of caster sugar, and 1 liter of gin.
