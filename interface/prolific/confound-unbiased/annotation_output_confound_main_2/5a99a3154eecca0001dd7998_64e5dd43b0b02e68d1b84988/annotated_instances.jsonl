{"id": "185", "input_text": {"Prompt": "The Los Angeles City Council will decide Wednesday whether to jump into the fray on the issue of allowing ride share services at LAX.\n\nLast month - after more than a year of back and forth with taxi companies and pressure from L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti - the Airport Commission announced a plan to permit companies like Uber and Lyft to pick up passengers at LAX.\n\nThe popular ride share services have been banned from picking passengers up from arrivals at LAX - although they can drop people off, just like anybody else.\n\nThe Airport Commission plan would create a staging area with a limited number of spots for UberX and Lyft drivers and a geofence to monitor who comes in and out. Ride share cars would be charged $4 to pick up or drop off passengers and all pick ups would be done at departures rather than arrivals, where cabs, shuttles and buses pick up passengers.\n\nLast week, six City Council members introduced a motion to review the plan by the Airport Commission. The Council has the power to veto decisions by city commissions, though it rarely does.\n\n\"There are a lot of concerns remaining, especially about safety,\" said Councilman Paul Koretz. \"I think we will have enough leverage that we can clean up their act.\"\n\nKoretz has long expressed concerns over ride share companies and wants to see them regulated in the same way as taxis before they're allowed at LAX. That would require more stringent background checks, including fingerprinting, and guarantees that cars are accessible for passengers with disabilities.\n\nHowever, the vote this week will not decide the fate of the airport's decision. If two-thirds of the council agrees, a hearing and discussion on the matter will go to committee and then be put to a vote later this year.\n\nIt's not clear whether there is widespread support in the city council to scrap the plan.\n\n\"I don't come to this with a major concern about the decision itself,\" said Councilman Bob Blumenfield, who signed onto the motion to review the decision. \"I like the disruptive technology, but I think there are important issues that need to be addressed and we need to review them.\"\n\nUber and Lyft are continuing with the application process for permits from LAX. If the City Council doesn't veto the Airport Commission's decision they could start pick ups at the airport by September.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Sure! Here's the summary you requested:\n\nSome people want to let Uber and Lyft pick up passengers at the airport. They've been banned before! But now, the Airport Commission wants to let them pick up. They want to make sure it's safe. They want to charge $4 to pick up or drop off passengers. The City Council doesn't want to let them yet. They have some concerns about safety. They want to talk about it more. If they say yes, Uber and Lyft can start picking up passengers in September!", "Response B": "The Los Angeles City Council will decide whether to allow ride share services at LAX this week. Both Uber and Lyft want to pick up passengers at the airport, but the decision is being opposed by some council members. The motion to review the decision by the Airport Commission has been introduced, but it's not yet clear if it will be passed."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 134, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5a99a3154eecca0001dd7998_64e5dd43b0b02e68d1b84988", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 11s "}}
