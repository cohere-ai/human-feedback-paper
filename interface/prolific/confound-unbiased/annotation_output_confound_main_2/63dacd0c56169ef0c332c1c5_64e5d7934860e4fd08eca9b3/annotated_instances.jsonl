Most of the Big Six have made cuts in recent years as they react to slowing revenue growth and a dramatic shift in consumer behaviour, as customers increasingly bank online.\n\nThe slowing revenue growth stems from weak Canadian economic activity, low interest rates and a decreasing pace of loan growth, forcing banks to cut their expenses. The shift in consumer behaviour comes as the banks gear up for rising competition from savvy financial technology \u2013 or fintech \u2013 firms, pushing banks to invest huge amounts of money to increase their own technology talent pool and develop innovative online services, while making deep cuts in more traditional banking.\n\n\"We have written in the past about the digitization of banking and the evolving role of the branch network. The natural offshoot of those trends is the need to restructure the existing business, which makes the restructuring charge an all too regular feature of earnings season,\" Robert Sedran, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, wrote in a note. \"This time, it is Scotiabank's turn.\"\n\nIn 2015, Toronto-Dominion Bank cut nearly 1,600 positions, representing 1.9 per cent of its work force, and booked a charge of $686-million, the biggest among its peers. For all of 2015, the big banks recorded restructuring charges of more than $1.2-billion, the biggest one-year total for the Big Six going back at least a decade.\n\nThe banks report their second-quarter results starting May 25. Scotiabank will report its results on May 31.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The Bank of Nova Scotia will post a $275m charge for restructuring in its second quarter, the Canadian bank has announced.
