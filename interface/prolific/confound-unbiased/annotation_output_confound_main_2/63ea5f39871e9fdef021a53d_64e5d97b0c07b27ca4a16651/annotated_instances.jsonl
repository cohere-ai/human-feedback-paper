When you\u2019re reading while walking, you want to make sure you\u2019re always looking where you\u2019re going, so you should read with your eyes, not with your head.  And you want to be sure you\u2019re not swaying back and forth while you\u2019re reading, because that can make you more likely to trip or stumble.  Just focus on taking one step at a time, and keep your eyes up, looking forward, as you read.", "Response B": "Well, there are a number of different training methods, and it can be difficult to know how best to train a dog.  It\u2019s always good to be clear and consistent in your commands, and to try to stay calm and confident in your interactions.  If you\u2019re ever unsure about how to proceed with training, I would suggest finding a qualified, experienced dog trainer to work with.  There are also many helpful resources available for dog owners."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_139", "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63ea5f39871e9fdef021a53d_64e5d97b0c07b27ca4a16651", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "1"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 38s "}}
