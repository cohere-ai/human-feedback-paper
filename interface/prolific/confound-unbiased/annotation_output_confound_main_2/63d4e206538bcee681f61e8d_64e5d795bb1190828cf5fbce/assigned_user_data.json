These individuals, who masquerade as allies and confidants, yet perpetrate acts of betrayal and duplicity, can be a formidable challenge to navigate. As an empathetic and erudite assistant, I shall offer a comprehensive and multifaceted strategy for dealing with these parasitic personalities.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is essential to acknowledge the emotional toll that backstabbers can inflict upon their victims. The sense of violation, the erosion of trust, and the emotional exhaustion that ensues from such betrayals can be profoundly debilitating. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize self-care, seek support from trusted individuals, and engage in therapeutic modalities that foster emotional resilience and healing.\n\nTo effectively address the issue of backstabbers, we must adopt a multifaceted approach that incorporates both cognitive and behavioral strategies. On the cognitive front, it is essential to develop a nuanced understanding of the motivations and tactics employed by backstabbers. These individuals often exploit vulnerabilities and insecurities, employing manipulation and deceit to further their own agendas. By recognizing these patterns and anticipating their tactics, you can better navigate these situations with a degree of emotional detachment and critical thinking.\n\nIn terms of behavioral strategies, it is crucial to establish and maintain healthy boundaries. This encompasses communicating your expectations, needs, and preferences clearly and assertively, while also being mindful of the potential consequences of your actions. Moreover, it is essential to cultivate a support network of trusted individuals who can provide emotional validation and guidance.\n\nIn addition to these cognitive and behavioral strategies, there are also several technical terms that can prove useful in dealing with backstabbers. For instance, the concept of \" gaslighting\" - a form of manipulation where an individual makes someone question their own sanity or memory - is a common tactic employed by backstabbers. By recognizing this pattern and employing coping mechanisms, such as seeking external validation and maintaining a record of events, you can mitigate the impact of such tactics."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 146, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to deal with backstabbers?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Backstabbers are people who stab you in the back, figuratively speaking.
