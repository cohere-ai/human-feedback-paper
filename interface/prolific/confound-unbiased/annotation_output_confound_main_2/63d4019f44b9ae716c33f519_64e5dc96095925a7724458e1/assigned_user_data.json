It is a subset of the Visual Basic programming language, and is designed to be easy to learn and use.\n\nTo begin programming with VBScript, you will need to create a new script file. This can be done by opening a text editor, such as Notepad, and saving the file with a .vbs extension. Once you have created your script file, you can begin adding code to it.\n\nThe basic syntax of VBScript is similar to that of other programming languages, with variables, functions, and loops.
