{"id": "254", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to clean a light bulb?", "Response A": "To clean a light bulb, you will need to gather a few supplies: a microfiber cloth, a small amount of vinegar, and a glass jar. First, turn off the light bulb and allow it to cool completely. Next, carefully remove the light bulb from the socket and place it in the glass jar. Add a small amount of vinegar to the microfiber cloth and gently wipe the light bulb to remove any dirt or dust. Be sure to avoid any areas of the light bulb that are hot, as this could cause the vinegar to evaporate and potentially damage the light bulb. Once the light bulb is clean, carefully replace it in the socket and turn it on to ensure it is working properly. If the light bulb is still not working, you may need to replace it.", "Response B": "There are a few different ways to clean a light bulb. One way is to use a soft, lint-free towel and wipe it very carefully, using only water or a very mild soap. You should be very gentle and careful not to scratch the surface of the bulb, and wipe the towel over the bulb until it is clean. Another way is to use a special bulb cleaner, which you can find at most hardware stores or home improvement stores. You can also mix a small amount of vinegar with some warm water in a bowl and use a soft cloth to clean the bulb, which is a very safe and effective way to clean it."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 134, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "644bcf6d13e9bc2ac17b796c_64e5dbf3ba7fe27d0ac6dad4", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 25s "}}
