Fitch said that policymaking in the kingdom has been concentrated in the hands of Prince Mohamed bin Salman, who is the country's defence minister and second in line to the throne, and that this has accelerated decision making. However, the ratings agency also said that this has made policy less predictable. Fitch said that tensions with Iran are expected to persist, although a direct confrontation is highly unlikely, and that Saudi Arabia's military intervention in Yemen and Syria shows a greater assertiveness in foreign policy. The ratings agency said that the degree of support for the deputy crown prince's initiatives from other parts of the royal family is uncertain, and that another ratings cut is possible in the future if the country's fiscal position deteriorate further or if stability is threatened by regional conflicts or domestic politics."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_146", "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d12ce9596919a0019367dd4_64e5d989b37d3d4a4b32b12b", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "1"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 21s "}}
