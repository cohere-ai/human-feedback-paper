Ashnard is a powerful enemy in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, and he's definitely not going to be easy to defeat. However, if you're able to use the right strategies and tactics, you should be able to take him down.\n\nOne of the key things you need to do in order to defeat Ashnard is to use your party's strength and weaknesses to your advantage. For example, if you have a character with high strength and defense, you can use them to take down Ashnard's physical attacks. If you have a character with high magic and resistance, you can use them to take down Ashnard's magical attacks.\n\nYou also need to be careful about when you use your party's abilities. For example, if you have a character with a powerful ability that can take down an enemy, you should use it when you have the opportunity to do so. However, you also need to be careful not to use it too early, or else you may not have enough time to use it again later in the fight.\n\nOverall, defeating Ashnard in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance will take some strategic thinking and careful planning.

One approach is to use a combination of magic and physical attacks to weaken him, and then focus on attacking his weaknesses. For example, Ashnard is weak to wind magic, so using a wind mage can be effective. Additionally, his strength is in close combat, so it may be helpful to use ranged attacks to keep him at a distance. Finally, building up your own units with strong defense and healing abilities can help you weather his attacks and eventually defeat him."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 143, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to defeat ashnard in fire emblem: path of radiance?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure, I can help you with that!
