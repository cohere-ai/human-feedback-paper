VBScript is a programming language that is used to create scripts for the Windows operating system. It is a popular choice for creating scripts that can be used to automate tasks or to provide user interface interactivity.\n\nHere are some basic steps to get started with VBScript:\n\n1. Install the VBScript development environment: You will need to install the VBScript development environment, which is typically a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) that supports VBScript. Some popular options include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad++.\n2. Create a new VBScript file: Once you have installed the development environment, you can create a new VBScript file by opening the text editor or IDE and creating a new file with the .vbs extension.\n3. Add your code: Once you have created a new VBScript file, you can add your code to the file. VBScript is a text-based language, so you can add your code by simply typing it into the file.\n4. Save your file: Once you have added your code to the file, you can save the file and close it.\n5. Open your VBScript file: Once you have saved your file and closed it, you can open it in the VBScript development environment.\n6. Run your script: Once you have opened your VBScript file, you can run your script by pressing the F5 key on your keyboard.\n7. Test your script: Once your script has been run, you can test it to see if it is working as expected. You can use the VBScript development environment's built-in testing tools or you can use a separate testing tool, such as the Microsoft Script Debugger or the Fiddler web debugging tool.\n\nThese are just a few basic steps to get started with VBScript. There are many more advanced features and techniques that you can use to create powerful and effective scripts."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 133, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "611f672bc947518ca8b25524_64e5d29fc026a9a259abcf27", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 17s "}}
