To find the Regis in Pok\u00e9mon Emerald, you must first defeat the Elite Four and become the Champion. Once you have done this, you can then travel to the Victory Road and find the Regis.", "Response B": "Sure, the Regis in Pokemon Emerald are Regice, Regirock and Registeel, which are three legendary Pokemon. They are ice, rock and steel types respectively. The three Regis are the leaders of the three teams in the Hoenn region, which are Team Aqua, Team Magma and Team Galactic. The Regis are very powerful and they each hold a special crystal that gives them their power. To defeat the Regis, you first have to defeat the leaders of each team and then they will combine their power to form the Regis. To defeat the Regis, you have to figure out a way to break their crystals and then they will be weakened and you can defeat them."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 132, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to find the regis in pok\u00e9mon emerald?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Yes.
