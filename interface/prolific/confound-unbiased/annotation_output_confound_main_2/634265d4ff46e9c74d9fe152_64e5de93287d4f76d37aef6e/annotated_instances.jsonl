This seems to be a decal for a helmet, vehicle or piece of equipment, made of reflective vinyl.  It has some kind of Maltese Cross design with axes, and is made by a company called \u201cFirefighters Sister\u201d.  I did find one online review that stated the product was of \u201cengineer grade quality\u201d, but I don\u2019t know what that means.  Overall this seems like a high quality product, but I am not qualified to write a good product description for it.", "Response B": "This item is a reflective Maltese cross decal with axes, measuring 6 inches in height.  It is manufactured from high-performance retro-reflective vinyl, which is an engineer grade quality vinyl that meets the ASTM 4956-99 specifications, and which provides superior durability and reflectivity.  The decal features a firefighter Maltese cross design, with axes on each arm of the cross, and is suitable for application on a firefighter's helmet, vehicle or other equipment.  The reflective qualities of the decal allow the colors to reflect when light hits them, providing enhanced visibility and safety."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "amazon", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 136, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "634265d4ff46e9c74d9fe152_64e5de93287d4f76d37aef6e", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "2", "score_b": "4", "feedback": "\"A\" have unhelpful main content with it not being confident in its answer right off the bat while \"B\" immediately gets into the user's request and perform a reasonable product description.
