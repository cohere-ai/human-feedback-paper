It's a great way to stay entertained and informed while you're on the go.\n\nTo read while walking, you'll need to find a comfortable spot to sit or stand, and bring a book or other reading material with you. You'll also need to be careful not to trip or fall, as you may be distracted by the book.\n\nOnce you've found a comfortable spot, you can start reading. It's a good idea to start with a short book or article, so you don't get too tired or bored.\n\nAs you read, you may want to take breaks every few minutes to stretch or walk around a bit. This will help you stay focused and avoid getting too tired.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 139, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to read while walking?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Is it safe to read while walking or should I wait until I am done walking?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response B </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure, I can tell you how to read while walking.
