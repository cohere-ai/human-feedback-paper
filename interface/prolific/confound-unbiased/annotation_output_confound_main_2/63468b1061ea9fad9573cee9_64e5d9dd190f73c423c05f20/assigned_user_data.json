Have a clear alcohol policy: Establish a clear alcohol policy that prohibits underage drinking and provides consequences for breaking the rule.\n2. Provide non-alcoholic beverages: Offer a variety of non-alcoholic beverages, such as fruit juices, soda, and water to keep the teens hydrated.\n3. Have designated drivers: Encourage teens to bring a designated driver who will stay sober and drive them home after the party.\n4. Provide alternative activities: Plan activities such as board games, sports, or karaoke to keep teens engaged and divert their attention from alcohol.\n5. Encourage parental involvement: Get parents involved in the party planning process and ask them to supervise the teens.\n6. Monitor the party: Have adults present at the party to supervise and ensure that the teens are not drinking.\n7. Educate teens: Educate teens about the dangers of underage drinking and the consequences of breaking the rules.\n\nBy implementing these methods, you can create a safe and sober environment for teens to enjoy themselves at a party.", "Response B": "I\u2019d be happy to try.  I think the single most important thing is to make sure there are plenty of non-alcoholic drinks available, and to make sure that alcohol is not served to anyone underage.  I also think it\u2019s important to provide food, and to encourage people to eat.  This can reduce the impact of alcohol, and also it\u2019s a good way to give people something to do besides drink.  I think it\u2019s also important to plan activities that will keep everyone entertained, so that people aren\u2019t just hanging around drinking.  Finally, I think it\u2019s important to make sure there are plenty of adults around who can keep an eye on things and make sure everyone is OK."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 144, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to keep teens from drinking at a party where alcohol is served?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            As an AI language model, I can suggest some ways to prevent teens from drinking at a party where alcohol is served:<br/><br/>1.
