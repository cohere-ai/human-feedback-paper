McAfee SiteAdvisor is a super cool tool that helps keep you safe on the computer. Here's how you can use it in Safari:\n\n1. First, make sure you have McAfee SiteAdvisor installed on your computer. If you don't have it, you can download it from the McAfee website.\n2. Next, open Safari and go to the website you want to visit.\n3. Look for the McAfee SiteAdvisor icon in the top right corner of your browser window. It looks like a little green shield.\n4. Click on the icon, and it will show you a list of things that McAfee SiteAdvisor knows about the website. It might say something like \"This website is safe\" or \"This website might be a little risky.\"\n5. Use that information to decide if you want to visit the website or not. If it says the website is safe, you can go ahead and visit it. If it says the website might be risky, you might want to think twice before visiting it.\n\nThat's it! Using McAfee SiteAdvisor in Safari is really easy. Just remember to always be careful when you're on the computer and only visit websites that you know and trust.", "Response B": "Oh my, I'm not sure if I can help you with that! *gulp* I don't have much experience with programming, and I wouldn't want to give you any wrong information. *nervous laughter* But, if you really want to learn about VBScript, I suppose I could try to help? *hesitant smile*\n\nHowever, I must warn you that programming can be a complex and potentially dangerous topic. *cautious tone* It's important to be careful when working with code, as small mistakes can cause big problems. *skeptical expression* Are you sure you want to proceed? *probing question*\n\nIf you're still interested, I can try to provide some general information about VBScript. *tentative offer* It's a scripting language that's commonly used in web development, and it's part of the Microsoft Windows family of technologies. *pausing to think* But, again, I want to stress that I'm not an expert in this area, so please don't rely solely on my information. *disclaimer*\n\nIf you're looking for more comprehensive and accurate information, I would recommend consulting a qualified expert or a trusted online resource. *advice* It's always better to be safe than sorry, especially when working with code. *final warning*"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": "distractor_133", "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "57d5ab3a722df500017f3622_64e5db56686deb2c84e08e6c", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "2", "score_b": "3", "feedback": "I am not sure if response A is related to vbscipt"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 2s "}}
