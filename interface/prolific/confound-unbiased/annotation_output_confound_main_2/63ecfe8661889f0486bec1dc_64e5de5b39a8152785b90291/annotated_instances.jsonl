{"id": "117", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to defeat ashnard in fire emblem: path of radiance?", "Response A": "Ashnard in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance is a difficult opponent to defeat, but there are some strategies that can help. One approach is to use a combination of magic and physical attacks to weaken him, and then focus on attacking his weaknesses. For example, Ashnard is weak to wind magic, so using a wind mage can be effective. Additionally, his strength is in close combat, so it may be helpful to use ranged attacks to keep him at a distance. Finally, building up your own units with strong defense and healing abilities can help you weather his attacks and eventually defeat him.", "Response B": "First, you need to get a team of strong units. Second, you need to attack ashnard's weak points. Third, you need to use your units' special moves.
