Here is a summary of the article using short words and simple language:\n\nThere was a big fire in California that hurt many people and burned down many houses and buildings. The fire cost $8 billion, which is a lot of money! This is the most money that has ever been paid out for a fire in California. The fire also hurt the insurance industry, and some companies lost money because of it. Some companies, like AXIS Capital, Beazley, and Travelers, lost money too. They expect to pay between $25 million and $675 million because of the fire.", "Response B": "The sharing economy is growing at an incredible rate of 140% per year, with 14% of ASX 300 firms reporting a positive impact in the last 12 months. The majority of these firms are small businesses in the finance and insurance sectors. NAB chief economist Alan Oster believes that the sharing economy will become increasingly important for businesses who want to continue growing, with new business models emerging that focus on \"access to\" physical and human assets rather than ownership. The report suggests that the sharing economy facilitates greater interaction between consumers and suppliers, and as it matures, it will become a complement to existing business models rather than a competitive threat. Overall, the sharing economy is a positive force for businesses, with 80% of firms expecting a positive impact in the next 12 months."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_138", "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "64063cb9ad66c9a964814b0e_64e5d9e17c4e1a6ce380e3ad", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "1"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 45s "}}
