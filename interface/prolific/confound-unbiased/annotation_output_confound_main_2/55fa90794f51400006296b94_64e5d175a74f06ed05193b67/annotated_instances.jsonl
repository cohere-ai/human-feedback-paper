It sounds like you\u2019re trying to catch a dragon, but I don\u2019t know anything more than that.", "Response B": "Trapping odahviing in Skyrim is a complex and challenging process, requiring a combination of specialized equipment, skills, and knowledge.  The most effective methods involve using a combination of traps, snares, and lures, as well as careful tracking and stalking techniques.  It is important to note that odahviing are highly intelligent and elusive creatures, and should only be trapped with extreme caution and respect for their well-being.  Some recommended trapping techniques include using pitfalls, nets, and poison darts, as well as mimicking the vocalizations and scent of prey animals.  Odahviing are also attracted to bright colors, so using brightly-colored traps and lures can be effective as well.  It is important to note that odahviing are protected by law in Skyrim, and should only be trapped for scientific research or personal enjoyment, not for commercial purposes.  To learn more about trapping odahviing, I would recommend consulting a variety of scientific resources and guides, as well as practicing these techniques in a safe and ethical manner."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 148, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "55fa90794f51400006296b94_64e5d175a74f06ed05193b67", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "2", "score_b": "4", "feedback": "Without having played the game, I assume Response B is accurate, though I have no way of telling."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 51s "}}
