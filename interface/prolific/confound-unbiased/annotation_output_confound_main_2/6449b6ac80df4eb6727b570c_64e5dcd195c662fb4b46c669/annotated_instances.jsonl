I think you'll need some flour, sugar, eggs, butter, milk, and chocolate chips. You'll also need some baking powder, baking soda, and salt. I'm not really sure how much of each ingredient you'll need, but I'll try to help you. I think you'll need to mix the dry ingredients together, then add the wet ingredients and mix until everything is combined. Then you'll need to fold in the chocolate chips. I'm not really sure how long you'll need to bake the cupcakes, but I'll try to help you. I think you'll need to bake them at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
