It was a heavy storm, with lots of thunder.\nZero: I was fast asleep, and didn't hear a thing.\nRuth: Well, it may rain again later today.\nZero: Maybe. I see some dark clouds moving in.\nRuth: There may also be a strong wind coming in.\nZero: It'll be dusty, too, I guess.\nRuth: Maybe not. Dust is no longer a big problem in Beijing.\nZero: Why is that?\nRuth: We've been planting trees for many years.\nZero: I see. The fall in Beijing is really beautiful.\nRuth: But the summer isn't. It's scorching in the summer.\nZero: Then what about spring?\nRuth: Spring is warm and short in Beijing.\nZero: It must be cold in the winter, though.\nRuth: You got it. Oh, by the way, it may be really cool in the evening around this time of the year.
