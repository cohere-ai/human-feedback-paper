I can tell you how to wrap them, and I can tell you how to make them.", "Response B": "Sure! To wrap polos, here are the steps:\n\n1.  Cut a piece of fabric large enough to wrap around the polo and long enough to extend past the polo by a few inches.\n\n2.  Fold the fabric in half lengthwise to create two layers.\n\n3.  Place the polo in the center of the fabric, with the top of the polo aligned with the fold.\n\n4.  Bring the bottom edge of the fabric up to the top of the polo.\n\n5.  Wrap the fabric around the polo, folding the excess fabric underneath as you go.\n\n6.  When you reach the top of the polo, tuck the excess fabric inside the fold.\n\n7.  To finish, use a needle and thread to sew the fabric closed along the top of the polo."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 44}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d190d52bb71e0e81d868f2_64b65616c654b2b9ac577163", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "2", "score_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 59s "}}
