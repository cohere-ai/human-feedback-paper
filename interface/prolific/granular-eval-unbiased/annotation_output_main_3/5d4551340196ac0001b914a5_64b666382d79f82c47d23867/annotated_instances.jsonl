You\u2019ll want to preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.  Then, wash and core the apples, but leave the peel on.  Place them in a baking dish.  Mix together 1/2 cup of granulated sugar, 2 tablespoons of melted butter, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and pour this mixture over the apples.  Then bake the apples for about 40 minutes, or until they\u2019re tender.  When they\u2019re done, sprinkle them with cinnamon, and serve them with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.  Enjoy!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 53}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d4551340196ac0001b914a5_64b666382d79f82c47d23867", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "1", "score_b": "5", "feedback": "The first response was just to basic with no help at all.
