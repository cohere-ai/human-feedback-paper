{"id": "922", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Google will now scan your emails for information relevant to advertising just a bit slower thanks to a settlement of a case pending in a Northern California district court. The system will now scan those emails after they're available in the recipient's Gmail mailbox, in contrast to Google's prior practice, where the email was scanned during the delivery process.\n\nSince each email message is scanned to deliver more relevant ads, the process meant that non-Gmail accounts were indirectly being cataloged as well. The plaintiffs in the case, which was styled Matera vs. Google, argued that this was a violation of both the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the California Information Privacy Act, calling the strategy \"the twenty-first-century equivalent of AT&T eavesdropping on each of its customers' phone conversations, or of the postal service taking information from private correspondence.\"\n\nInstead of fight the case, Google agreed to change how it scans these emails \u2014 although scans for spam and malware would still occur during the delivery process as occurred before. The change will be seamless to customers, as it literally is a matter of milliseconds in processing time.\n\nIt's not clear whether Google was receiving any material benefit from the strategy \u2014 i.e. data from those non-Gmail users being used to serve more relevant ads across Google's widespread ad network. It also agreed to pay any legal costs related to the case and make a one-time payment of $2,000 to each of the class representatives.\n\nOther ad providers have not been so lucky. Yahoo was forced to settle over similar issues with its email-related ad-targeting practices, but ended up paying close to twice what Google had to in legal costs (about $4 million).\n\nGoogle declined to comment on the settlement, but offered that its efforts would result in concrete technical changes. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not respond to a request for comment as of press time.\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Google has settled a case pending in a Northern California district court, after it was alleged that the company's practice of scanning emails in order to serve more relevant ads violated the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the California Information Privacy Act. Under the settlement, Google has agreed to change its practices, and will now scan emails after they have been received in the recipient's Gmail mailbox, rather than during the delivery process. Google has also agreed to pay the legal costs of the case, and make a one-time payment of $2,000 to each of the class representatives.", "Response B": "Google has reached a settlement with the Matera v. Google case pending in a Northern California district court, which had alleged that Google's scanning of non-Gmail email accounts was a violation of federal and state law. The settlement does not detail Google's plans for the future of the scanning process, but it does state that Google will change its scanning processes so that the scanning of the emails is no longer done during the delivery process. Instead, Google will scan the emails after they have been received by the recipient. The settlement also does not specify the material benefit of Google's scanning practices, or the amount of the settlement."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 61}, "label_annotations": {"email": "60f5df9db9380d875c320307_64b65780b0f7aafafbf8be85", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "2"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 51s "}}
