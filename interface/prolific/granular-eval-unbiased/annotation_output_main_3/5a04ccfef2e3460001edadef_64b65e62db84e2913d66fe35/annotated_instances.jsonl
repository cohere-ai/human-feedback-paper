If you're selling a product that already exists on Amazon, you can search for the product and use its existing ASIN.", "Response B": "Sure, I can help you with that.  In order to get an ASIN, you\u2019ll need to create an Amazon account, and then click on \u201cCreate an ASIN\u201d from the \u201cMy Items\u201d page.  After you do that, you\u2019ll be given a page where you can enter information about your product, and then click \u201cCreate ASIN\u201d."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 54}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5a04ccfef2e3460001edadef_64b65e62db84e2913d66fe35", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "4", "feedback": "The responses are different but both sound as if they are correct.
