Hence, Accenture suggests a new approach called the \"Internet of Me,\" which is focused on creating better experiences for consumers. The company also predicts other trends on which it will focus, including the 'outcome economy,' platform-driven businesses, intelligent enterprise, and the 'workforce reimagined.'", "Response B": "Accenture believes that current focus on Internet of Things has been on gadgets rather than creating better consumer experiences. The company also believes that wearable consumer technologies have high abandonment rate, which is due to these technologies being gadgets and not providing sustainable value to the consumers. Accenture will focus on four trends, namely outcome economy, platform-driven businesses, intelligent enterprise and workforce reimagined in future. The latter one focuses on technology and how it can be used to improve workforce productivity while addressing policy and corporate implications."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 54}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5a56970b76d1c60001aaf2ab_64b664250237fca512e49624", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 15s "}}
