First, let me explain a little about what credit is, and what it\u2019s used for.  When you buy something on credit, you\u2019re borrowing money from a bank or other lender, and agreeing to pay it back later.  So, when you borrow money, you\u2019re building up a credit history, which is a record of how you\u2019ve borrowed money in the past, and how you\u2019ve paid it back.  Credit history is important because it gives a sense of how responsible you are with money, and how likely you are to pay back any money you borrow in the future.  When you have a good credit history, you\u2019re a good credit risk, and banks and other lenders will be more likely to lend you money in the future."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 51}, "label_annotations": {"email": "614e4f5af7eba1c013541155_64b65c9d4bff15aa40a481a4", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "2", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 16s "}}
