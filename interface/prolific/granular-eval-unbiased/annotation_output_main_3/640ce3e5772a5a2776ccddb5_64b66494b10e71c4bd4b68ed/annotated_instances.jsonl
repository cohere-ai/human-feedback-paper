{"id": "253", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to improve media relations at an ad agency?", "Response A": "Of course.  I can\u2019t tell you exactly how to do it, since I don\u2019t have any experience with an ad agency.  But I can tell you a few things that may be relevant, based on my general knowledge of the world.  \n\nFirst, if you want to improve media relations at your agency, you might start by assessing how the current state of media relations is affecting the agency\u2019s bottom line.  For example, if the agency\u2019s reputation is suffering, or if the agency is having a hard time winning new business, that will probably be a good indicator that the media relations work needs to be improved.  \n\nSecond, you might think about why the media relations work is being done in the first place.  If the goal is to help the agency win new business, you\u2019ll want to make sure that your media relations work is helping with that.  If the goal is to help the agency improve its reputation, you\u2019ll want to make sure that the media relations work is having a positive effect on the agency\u2019s reputation.  \n\nThird, you might think about whether the current state of media relations is consistent with the agency\u2019s values.  For example, if the agency prides itself on being a cutting-edge, innovative place, it might be worth considering whether the current media relations work is helping the agency to achieve that goal.  \n\nFinally, you might want to think about how the media relations work is being done.  If the agency has a great reputation and is winning new business successfully, you might want to think about whether the current media relations work is being done effectively.  If the agency has a poor reputation and isn\u2019t winning new business successfully, you might want to think about whether the current media relations work is being done ineffectively.", "Response B": "There are several ways to improve media relations at an ad agency. One way is to establish a good relationship with media contacts by sending them press releases, pitching story ideas, and keeping them updated on your agency's work. It's also important to be transparent and honest in your interactions with them. Another way is to provide valuable content that journalists can use in their stories, such as case studies or data-driven insights. You can also leverage social media to connect with journalists and share your agency's work with a wider audience. Finally, it's important to have a clear and consistent messaging strategy that aligns with your agency's mission and values, and to be responsive to media inquiries in a timely manner."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 49}, "label_annotations": {"email": "640ce3e5772a5a2776ccddb5_64b66494b10e71c4bd4b68ed", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "2", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 23s "}}
