Once inside, you can find the elevator that will take you to the top of the pit. You will then need to fight a boss before you can continue on to the next area."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 46}, "label_annotations": {"email": "60a3ad2958396c75e532e5d6_64b659bdf14ebee96157714a", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 26s "}}
