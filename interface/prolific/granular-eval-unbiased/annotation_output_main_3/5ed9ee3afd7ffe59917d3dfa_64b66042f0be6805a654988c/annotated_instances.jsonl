As of July 22, there were 2,592 confirmed cases of Ebola in the region and at least 1,743 related deaths, per USAID. Last week, there were 2,428 confirmed cases and 1,604 confirmed deaths.\n\nThe risk of the deadly virus spreading outside the region remains low, according to WHO's global health warning on July 17.\n\nDetails: USAID will send $15 million of its new assistance package to WHO, per Wednesday's press release. The U.S. is also funding \"critical preparedness efforts\" in Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda.\n\nUSAID's $38 million will also fund training for health care workers, enhanced surveillance for the disease, the promotion of safe burials and food, among other efforts.\n\nUSAID has spent more than $136 million since the beginning of the outbreak in August 2018, per Wednesday's press release.\n\nGo deeper: WHO amps up global Ebola warning after spread to big Congo city\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The US Agency for International Development (USAID) will send $38m to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), several neighbouring countries and the World Health Organization (WHO) to help tackle the Ebola outbreak. It comes after the WHO issued a global health warning on the crisis. USAID confirmed 2,592 cases in the region and around 1,743 related deaths, as of 22 July. USAID has spent $136m since the outbreak began in August 2018, according to its press release.", "Response B": "Silicon Valley start-up Aeva has joined in with efforts to build more effective sensors for autonomous vehicles. Driverless cars under development today track their surroundings using cameras, radar, GPS and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) devices that measure distances using pulses of light emitted individually. However, the Aeva prototype sends out a continuous wave of light, enabling a more precise and reliable view of the world around autonomous cars. Founded by two ex-members of Apple's special projects group, the Aeva prototype is still under development, but the company hopes to start selling devices next year."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_55"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5ed9ee3afd7ffe59917d3dfa_64b66042f0be6805a654988c", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "1"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 42s "}}
