I was wondering if anyone has turned in a passport?\nSean: I am afraid not. Have you lost your passport?\nCharles: I think so. I can't find it anywhere in my hotel room and I remember the last place I used it yesterday was in this department store.\nSean: Where exactly did you use your passport in the store?\nCharles: In the shoe department. I had to show it to pay for these shoes with my traveler's cheques.\nSean: Well, let me call the shoe department to see if they'Ve found a passport. Sorry, your passport hasn't turned up there either.\nCharles: Then what shall I do?\nSean: You can fill in this lost property report and I will keep my eye out for it. These kinds of things usually turn up eventually, but I suggest you contact your embassy and tell them about your situation, so they can issue you a new passport in case it doesn't show up.\nCharles: You are right. Do you have a pen?\nSean: Here you are.\nCharles: Oh, I seem to lose something every time I travel.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "Sean has been looking for a passport that Charles has lost.
