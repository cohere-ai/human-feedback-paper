It was a heavy storm, with lots of thunder.\nZero: I was fast asleep, and didn't hear a thing.\nRuth: Well, it may rain again later today.\nZero: Maybe. I see some dark clouds moving in.\nRuth: There may also be a strong wind coming in.\nZero: It'll be dusty, too, I guess.\nRuth: Maybe not. Dust is no longer a big problem in Beijing.\nZero: Why is that?\nRuth: We've been planting trees for many years.\nZero: I see. The fall in Beijing is really beautiful.\nRuth: But the summer isn't. It's scorching in the summer.\nZero: Then what about spring?\nRuth: Spring is warm and short in Beijing.\nZero: It must be cold in the winter, though.\nRuth: You got it. Oh, by the way, it may be really cool in the evening around this time of the year. Don't forget to put on more clothes, or you might catch a cold.\nZero: Thanks for reminding me.\nRuth: You're welcome.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "Ruth and Zero enjoy the fresh air today.
