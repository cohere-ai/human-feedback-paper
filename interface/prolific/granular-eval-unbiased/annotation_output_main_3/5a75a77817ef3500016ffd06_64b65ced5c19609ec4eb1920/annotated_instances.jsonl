{"id": "650", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Trapped by Hitler's soldiers during the brutal winter of 1941-42, a band of Russian botanists faced a terrible choice.\n\nFor more than a decade, workers at the Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry had been gathering seeds from all over the world and carefully preserving them in a locked vault. They believed they held the raw materials to allow scientists to breed the super plants of the future, crops that could survive anything nature could throw at them.\n\nThe Institute's founder, Nikolai Vavilov, had spent years collecting rare and wild relatives of wheat, rye and other staples so crop breeders could mine their hardy genes. Now the Nazis had laid siege to Leningrad (now St Petersburg), preventing the institute's workers from leaving the city. So the botanists barricaded themselves in with the stash, preparing to defend it from rats, freezing weather and desperately hungry citizens.\n\nLesser scientists would have eaten the precious packs of rice, wheat, peas, oats and potatoes during the 28-month siege. Instead, Dmitri S Ivanov, the head of the rice collection, a bespectacled man with fine, side-parted hair, painstakingly conserved several thousand packs of rice while gradually succumbing to malnutrition.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "A new book reveals the story of a group of Russian botanists who faced a terrible choice during World War II: to eat the plants they had collected for the war effort, or to preserve them for the future.", "Response B": "The team behind the Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry in Russia had collected seeds from all over the world, hoping to breed super-crops that could withstand the toughest of conditions. However, when the Nazis laid siege to the institute in 1941, workers were trapped inside with the seeds, unable to leave. The team faced the choice of either eating the seeds or starvation."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 59}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5a75a77817ef3500016ffd06_64b65ced5c19609ec4eb1920", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "1", "score_b": "2", "feedback": "One mildly less worse than the other. The first claims that 'a new book reveals' which cannot be deduced from then text. There is no mention of a book and the story is already known. The second is marginally better but again makes false claims. There was no programme to produce 'super crops' in the sense implied. The Germans did not lay siege to the institute, they laid siege to the city. The scientists were not trapped in the building and they did not face the choice of eating the seeds or starvation. The seeds would have not made a difference except for a very short time. They had specimens not grain stores. The article itself is partly to blame. The rationing system in Leningrad favoured those who could work. Scientists worked IF THEY COULD and received extra rations. The difference between life and death was having connections or working in priority war industries or the usual black market connections such as having a stolen workers ration card. The reasons why the institute did not evacuate as many others did is not explained. Industry was given priority but for example the Hermitage was evacuated and most of its treasures went with the staff. The conclusion by the bot is facile to the point of falsity."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 11m 37s "}}
