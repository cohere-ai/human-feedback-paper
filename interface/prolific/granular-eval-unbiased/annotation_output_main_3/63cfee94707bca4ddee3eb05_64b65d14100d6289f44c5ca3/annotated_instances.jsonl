You can also try to keep a calm, gentle demeanor, speak in a soft voice, and offer treats or praise for good behavior.  Other helpful strategies include practicing training in a quiet, distraction-free environment, using hand signals in addition to verbal commands, and gradually introducing new commands or behaviors.
