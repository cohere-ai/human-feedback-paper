In this case, you need to get an Egg from a female Chikorita. You can get an Egg from a wild female Chikorita or by breeding a male Chikorita with a female Pok\u00e9mon that can produce an Egg. Once you have the Egg, you need to hatch it by walking around with it as your active Pok\u00e9mon. The Egg will hatch after a certain number of steps, and you will have a 50% chance of getting a female Chikorita."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 61}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5f6e71ea9dd5cb3b2bdb45b6_64b66211484591b0399688d1", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "1", "score_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 59s "}}
