You can also try to keep a calm, gentle demeanor, speak in a soft voice, and offer treats or praise for good behavior.  Other helpful strategies include practicing training in a quiet, distraction-free environment, using hand signals in addition to verbal commands, and gradually introducing new commands or behaviors.  Overall, training a dog requires patience, positive reinforcement, and consistency, so it\u2019s important to take your time and avoid confusing or frightening the dog during training sessions."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 59}, "label_annotations": {"email": "60bf8f44f1188266dd8a3e85_64b656df848b9d76041546ab", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 49s "}}
