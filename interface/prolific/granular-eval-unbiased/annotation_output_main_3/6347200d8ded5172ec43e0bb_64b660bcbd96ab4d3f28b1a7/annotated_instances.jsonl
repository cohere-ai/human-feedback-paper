Daugherty said the current approach of the Internet of Things around gadgetry may be good business now, but consumers have not developed a loyalty to the technologies.\n\n'Wearable consumer technologies have the highest abandonment rate of any consumer product category. That's because they're gadgets that people don't find sustainable value in,' he said. 'I'm generalizing, there are some that are good, but generally people abandon them at a rate of seven in 10 people within one year.'\n\nThe CTO pointed out that the churn around life cycles of small consumer gadgets profit businesses, 'but the customers aren't using them sustainably.'\n\nOther trends on which Accenture will focus are the 'outcome economy,' platform-driven businesses, intelligent enterprise, and the 'workforce reimagined,' he said.\n\n'There really needs to be a focus on the workforce and thinking about how the workforce works in different ways, and looking at both the policy and the corporate implications of how we can prepare the workforce to work in a new way. And a lot of this will be connected around how people interact with technology in a different way to work more effectively, work more safely,' Daugherty said.\n\nPUBLISHED JULY 13, 2015\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "University of Tokyo researchers have developed a new ink that can be printed on textiles in a single step to form highly conductive and stretchable connections, enabling sports garments to measure heart rate and muscle conditions. Currently, sensors are typically printed on fairly rigid surfaces, but these stretchy garments will be able to fit themselves to the human body. This ink is comprised of silver flakes, organic solvent, fluorine rubber and fluorine surfactant and ink exhibited high conductivity even when it was stretched to more than three times its original length.", "Response B": "The current focus of IoT is misplaced on technology and gadget, and not where it should be - creating a better experience for consumers, according to the Chief Technology Officer of Accenture, Paul Daugherty. Speaking at MIT, he added that the reason for the high abandonment rate of wearable technology is \"because they're gadgets that people don't find sustainable value in.\""}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": "distractor_54"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6347200d8ded5172ec43e0bb_64b660bcbd96ab4d3f28b1a7", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "1", "score_b": "4", "feedback": "Response A has nothing to do with the topic."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 6m 12s "}}
