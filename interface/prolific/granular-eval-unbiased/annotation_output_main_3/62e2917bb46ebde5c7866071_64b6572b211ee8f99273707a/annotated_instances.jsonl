It's important to be patient with yourself and allow for setbacks along the way. Consider practicing mindfulness techniques such as meditation or deep breathing to help manage symptoms. Surround yourself with support from loved ones, a therapist, or a support group. Celebrate small victories and focus on the progress you've made rather than the distance you still have to go.
