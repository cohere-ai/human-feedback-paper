Then, fold one of the sleeves back to the middle of the shirt, making sure it's aligned. Next, fold the other sleeve back to the middle of the shirt, also making sure it's aligned. Fold the bottom of the shirt up to the middle, then fold the shirt in half. Finally, fold the sleeves over the shirt and adjust as necessary to get a neat and compact wrap.", "Response B": "Sure! To wrap polos, here are the steps:\n\n1.  Cut a piece of fabric large enough to wrap around the polo and long enough to extend past the polo by a few inches.\n\n2.  Fold the fabric in half lengthwise to create two layers.\n\n3.  Place the polo in the center of the fabric, with the top of the polo aligned with the fold.\n\n4.  Bring the bottom edge of the fabric up to the top of the polo.\n\n5.  Wrap the fabric around the polo, folding the excess fabric underneath as you go.\n\n6.  When you reach the top of the polo, tuck the excess fabric inside the fold.\n\n7.  To finish, use a needle and thread to sew the fabric closed along the top of the polo."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 44}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to wrap polos?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            To wrap a polo, first lay it flat on a surface.
