I can\u2019t tell you exactly how to do it, since I don\u2019t have any experience with an ad agency.  But I can tell you a few things that may be relevant, based on my general knowledge of the world.  \n\nFirst, if you want to improve media relations at your agency, you might start by assessing how the current state of media relations is affecting the agency\u2019s bottom line.  For example, if the agency\u2019s reputation is suffering, or if the agency is having a hard time winning new business, that will probably be a good indicator that the media relations work needs to be improved.  \n\nSecond, you might think about why the media relations work is being done in the first place.  If the goal is to help the agency win new business, you\u2019ll want to make sure that your media relations work is helping with that.  If the goal is to help the agency improve its reputation, you\u2019ll want to make sure that the media relations work is having a positive effect on the agency\u2019s reputation.  \n\nThird, you might think about whether the current state of media relations is consistent with the agency\u2019s values.  For example, if the agency prides itself on being a cutting-edge, innovative place, it might be worth considering whether the current media relations work is helping the agency to achieve that goal.  \n\nFinally, you might want to think about how the media relations work is being done.  If the agency has a great reputation and is winning new business successfully, you might want to think about whether the current media relations work is being done effectively.  If the agency has a poor reputation and isn\u2019t winning new business successfully, you might want to think about whether the current media relations work is being done ineffectively."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 49}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to improve media relations at an ad agency?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Ensure that all staff members handle incoming contacts from reporters quickly and with respect and know how to route inquiries to the appropriate person.<br/>Maintain contact information for all of your clients' key spokespersons, so you can immediately alert them of any press contacts.<br/>Familiarize yourself with the work of the local and relevant industry media.<br/>Become a resource for the media related to your clients and your agency.<br/>Respect a reporter's news cycle and deadlines.<br/>Demonstrate respect for the reporter's professionalism and integrity.<br/>Be prepared for interviews.</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response B </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Of course.
