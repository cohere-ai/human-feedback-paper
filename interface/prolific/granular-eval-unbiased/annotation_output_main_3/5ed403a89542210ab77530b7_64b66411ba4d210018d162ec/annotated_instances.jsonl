{"id": "283", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to be patient when recovering from mental illness?", "Response A": "Recovering from mental illness can be a long and challenging process. It's important to be patient with yourself and allow for setbacks along the way. Consider practicing mindfulness techniques such as meditation or deep breathing to help manage symptoms. Surround yourself with support from loved ones, a therapist, or a support group. Celebrate small victories and focus on the progress you've made rather than the distance you still have to go. Remember that recovery is a journey and it's okay to take it one step at a time.", "Response B": "One thing you can do is distract yourself by focusing on other activities, like watching TV or going for a walk.  You can also try to change your outlook by thinking about how you\u2019d cope in a similar situation in the past, or how you\u2019d advise a friend to cope in a similar situation."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 45}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5ed403a89542210ab77530b7_64b66411ba4d210018d162ec", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "2"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 29s "}}
