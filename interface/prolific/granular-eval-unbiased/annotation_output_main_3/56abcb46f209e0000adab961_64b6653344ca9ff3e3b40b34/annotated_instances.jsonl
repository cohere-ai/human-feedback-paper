In a large bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.\n3. In a separate large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating well after each. Beat in the vanilla extract. Beat in the flour mixture and then beat until just combined.
