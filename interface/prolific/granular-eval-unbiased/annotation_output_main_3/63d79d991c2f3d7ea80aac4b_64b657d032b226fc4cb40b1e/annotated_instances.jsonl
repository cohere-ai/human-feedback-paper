This shows lenders that you are responsible and can be trusted. Second, keep your credit utilization low. This means using a small percentage of your available credit at any given time. Third, avoid opening too many new accounts at once. Finally, monitor your credit report regularly to ensure that there are no errors or fraudulent activity.", "Response B": "I can give you some general advice about how to keep your credit in good standing.  First, make sure to always pay your bills on time.  Second, don\u2019t take out more credit than you can afford to pay back.  Third, check your credit report regularly to make sure there aren\u2019t any errors on it.  Finally, don\u2019t close any credit accounts, since that can negatively impact your credit score."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 51}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d79d991c2f3d7ea80aac4b_64b657d032b226fc4cb40b1e", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 29s "}}
