Then, fold one of the sleeves back to the middle of the shirt, making sure it's aligned. Next, fold the other sleeve back to the middle of the shirt, also making sure it's aligned. Fold the bottom of the shirt up to the middle, then fold the shirt in half. Finally, fold the sleeves over the shirt and adjust as necessary to get a neat and compact wrap."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 44}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to wrap polos?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Bend over, don\u2019t kneel.<br/>Wrap the leg in the right place.<br/>Wrap to the back.<br/>Don\u2019t reroll when you unwrap.<br/>Clean wraps and legs.<br/>Place a lead on their head.<br/>Apply pressure evenly while wrapping.<br/>Use polo wraps for mounted work.<br/>Distinguish polo wraps from standing bandages.<br/>Look for Velcro.<br/>Choose from a variety of colors.<br/>Make your own wraps.</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response B </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            To wrap a polo, first lay it flat on a surface.
