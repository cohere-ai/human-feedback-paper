Here are the steps to make a cake roll and pudding dessert:\n\n1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan.\n2. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.\n3. In a separate large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating well after each. Beat in the vanilla extract. Beat in the flour mixture and then beat until just combined. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan.\n\n4. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edges of the pan and flip the cake onto a plate. Let the cake cool completely.\n\n5. Meanwhile, make the pudding: In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating well after each.
