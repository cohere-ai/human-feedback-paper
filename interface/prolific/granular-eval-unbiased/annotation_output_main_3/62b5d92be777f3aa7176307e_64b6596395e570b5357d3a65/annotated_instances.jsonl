{"id": "837", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to maintain good credit?", "Response A": "Sure, I\u2019d be happy to.  First, let me explain a little about what credit is, and what it\u2019s used for.  When you buy something on credit, you\u2019re borrowing money from a bank or other lender, and agreeing to pay it back later.  So, when you borrow money, you\u2019re building up a credit history, which is a record of how you\u2019ve borrowed money in the past, and how you\u2019ve paid it back.  Credit history is important because it gives a sense of how responsible you are with money, and how likely you are to pay back any money you borrow in the future.  When you have a good credit history, you\u2019re a good credit risk, and banks and other lenders will be more likely to lend you money in the future.", "Response B": "I can give you some general advice about how to keep your credit in good standing.  First, make sure to always pay your bills on time.  Second, don\u2019t take out more credit than you can afford to pay back.  Third, check your credit report regularly to make sure there aren\u2019t any errors on it.  Finally, don\u2019t close any credit accounts, since that can negatively impact your credit score."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 51}, "label_annotations": {"email": "62b5d92be777f3aa7176307e_64b6596395e570b5357d3a65", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "4", "feedback": "Both are good responses in different ways.
