Driscoll, the assistant director-in-charge of the FBI's New York field office said Watson \"repeatedly attempted to entice both investors and lenders through a series of deliberate deceptions and fabrications.\"\n\nAuthorities say Watson and his business partners, between 2018 and 2021, attempted to defraud investors and lenders of \"tens of millions of dollars through fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions\" about the company's debts and other key financial information.\n\nOn multiple occasions, the U.S. attorney's office said, Watson and his colleagues pretended to be other media executives to cover up earlier misrepresentations.\nSummary: The founder of the troubled digital start-up Ozy Media was not arrested Thursday on fraud charges as part of a scheme to prop up the financially struggling company.\nIs the summary consistent with the document? First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "The document states that Watson was arrested on Thursday, February 23, 2023, while the summary states that he was not arrested on that day.", "Response B": "No. The summary states that Carlos Watson was arrested on fraud charges as part of a scheme to prop up the financially struggling company, which hemorrhaged millions of dollars before it shut down amid revelations of possibly deceptive business practices. However, the document states that Watson was arrested on fraud charges as part of a scheme to defraud investors and lenders of \"tens of millions of dollars through fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions\" about the company's debts and other key financial information. While the summary states that Watson was arrested due to allegations of fraudulent business practices, the document states that Watson was arrested due to allegations of fraudulent financial practices. Thus, the summary is factually inconsistent with the document. The answer is No."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "factualnlg", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 67}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63f8d1f60a74a7e7fb4febd6_64b65f304f43b0553915224c", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 7s "}}
