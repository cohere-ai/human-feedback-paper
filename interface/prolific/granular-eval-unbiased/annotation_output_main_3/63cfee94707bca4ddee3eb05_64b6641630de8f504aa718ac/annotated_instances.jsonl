That's my favorite subject.\nBen: That's because you always find it so easy. I find it very difficult so I don't like it much.\nAlice: Nancy finds English quite difficult too. But she says it's her favorite subject.\nBen: Yes, I know, and her second favorite subject is math.\nAlice: Math is my worst. I don't like it. I always get the answers wrong.\nBen: So if English is your favorite subject, what's your second favorite?\nAlice: PE. What about you?\nBen: I'm not sure. Both Chinese and science are my favorite subjects. I think I like Chinese a little more than science.\nAlice: You are very different from Nancy. She doesn't like science at all.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "William takes a taxi to the Friendship Hotel for something important.", "Response B": "Lin Fang and Lucy are talking about their favourite subjects."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "dialogsum", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": "distractor_46"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63cfee94707bca4ddee3eb05_64b6641630de8f504aa718ac", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "1", "score_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 37s "}}
