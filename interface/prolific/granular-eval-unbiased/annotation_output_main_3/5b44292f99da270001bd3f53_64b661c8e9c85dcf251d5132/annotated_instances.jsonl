{"id": "414", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to clean a computer monitor?", "Response A": "To clean a computer monitor, first turn it off and unplug it. Then, use a microfiber cloth or a soft, lint-free cloth to gently wipe the screen. Avoid using paper towels, which can scratch the surface. If there are fingerprints or smudges that won't come off, you can use a mixture of water and isopropyl alcohol (in equal parts) to clean the screen. Apply the solution to the cloth, not the screen directly, and gently wipe the screen. Finally, dry the screen with a microfiber cloth to avoid water spots.", "Response B": "Sure!  The first step is to turn off the computer and remove the monitor from the computer.  Next, you\u2019ll want to open the monitor\u2019s case and remove the screen.  Then, you\u2019ll want to clean the screen with a damp cloth.  You\u2019ll want to make sure that the screen is completely dry before putting it back into the case.  Then, you\u2019ll want to put the monitor back into the case and turn on the computer."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 50}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5b44292f99da270001bd3f53_64b661c8e9c85dcf251d5132", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 41s "}}
