Catherine encourages Jennifer to go over and talk to her. Jennifer agrees and after drinking another cup of beer, she tries to approach the girl but is hesitant because she is scared of being rejected. Catherine warns that other guys are also eyeing the girl up, so Jennifer quickly approaches her before anyone else can.", "Response B": "Catherine and Jennifer are at a party and enjoying themselves.
