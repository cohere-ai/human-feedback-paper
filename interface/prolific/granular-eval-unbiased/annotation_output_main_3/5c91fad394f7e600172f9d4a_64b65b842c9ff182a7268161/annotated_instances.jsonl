They believed they held the raw materials to allow scientists to breed the super plants of the future, crops that could survive anything nature could throw at them.\n\nThe Institute's founder, Nikolai Vavilov, had spent years collecting rare and wild relatives of wheat, rye and other staples so crop breeders could mine their hardy genes. Now the Nazis had laid siege to Leningrad (now St Petersburg), preventing the institute's workers from leaving the city. So the botanists barricaded themselves in with the stash, preparing to defend it from rats, freezing weather and desperately hungry citizens.\n\nLesser scientists would have eaten the precious packs of rice, wheat, peas, oats and potatoes during the 28-month siege.
