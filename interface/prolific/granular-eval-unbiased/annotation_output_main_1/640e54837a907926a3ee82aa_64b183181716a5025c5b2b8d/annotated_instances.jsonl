{"id": "1232", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to grow yellow squash?", "Response A": "Sure, I can help you with that.  Yellow squash are a type of summer vegetable that grow on a vine and are harvested at the end of the summer.  They\u2019re a great source of vitamin A and potassium, and they\u2019re also low in calories and carbohydrates.  Here are some tips on how to grow yellow squash:\n\n1.  Start by planting seeds in the ground, about two weeks before the last frost.  You can plant them in rows, or in small groups.\n2.  Keep the soil moist, and don\u2019t plant the seeds too deep.  You\u2019ll want to keep the soil warm for the seeds to germinate.\n3.  Once the seeds have germinated, you\u2019ll need to support the vines with a trellis or stake.  Make sure the vines are getting enough sunlight, and that they have plenty of room to grow.\n4.  When the vines are about three feet long, you can start to harvest them.  The best way to do this is to cut the vines at the stem, and then you can peel the skin off the inside of the fruit.  You can also cut the fruit into slices, and then cook them in a skillet with a little oil.  Once they\u2019re cooked, you can serve them with salt and pepper.", "Response B": "Sure. You can grow squash in the ground, or you can grow it in a pot. To grow it in the ground, you\u2019ll need a patch of soil that gets lots of sunlight, so that the squash can grow. You can start with a few seeds in the soil, and once they begin to grow, you\u2019ll need to give them room to spread out, and you\u2019ll need to water them regularly so that they can grow. If you grow them in a pot, you\u2019ll need a large pot, and you\u2019ll need to make sure that the pot is very well-drained, so that the roots can grow well. You\u2019ll also need to give the squash room to spread out in the pot, and you\u2019ll need to make sure that the pot is large enough so that the squash can grow. You can start with a few seeds in the pot, and once they begin to grow, you\u2019ll need to give them room to spread out, and you\u2019ll need to water them regularly so that they can grow."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 9}, "label_annotations": {"email": "640e54837a907926a3ee82aa_64b183181716a5025c5b2b8d", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "4", "feedback": "They both provide good detail but the format of A makes it easier to read and comprehend"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 17s "}}
