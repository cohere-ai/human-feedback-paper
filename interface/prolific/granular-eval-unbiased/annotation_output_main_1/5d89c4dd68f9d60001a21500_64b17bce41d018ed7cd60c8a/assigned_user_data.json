{"3": {"id": "3", "text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to deal with an ex boyfriend who wants more space?", "Response A": "Sure, I can explain a bit about what \u201cspace\u201d means in a relationship, and how you might be able to work with that.  Space is a common request in relationships, and it basically means that the person wants some time and emotional space from you.  It can be difficult to hear that someone wants space from you, especially if you\u2019ve been very close, but it can be very healthy to give each other space from time to time.  Space can help you both to focus on yourself, and also to miss each other, which can help strengthen the relationship.  One way to do that is to try to respect your ex\u2019s desire for space, and not contact him or try to force a connection.  You could also try to take some time for yourself to focus on your own interests and hobbies, so that you\u2019re not constantly thinking about him.  Hope that helps!", "Response B": "Well, I\u2019m not sure that I understand what you mean by \u201cmore space\u201d.  Do you mean he wants to have more space in his life, or in your life?
