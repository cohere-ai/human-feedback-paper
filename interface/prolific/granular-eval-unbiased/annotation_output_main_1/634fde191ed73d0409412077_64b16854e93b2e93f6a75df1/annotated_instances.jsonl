{"id": "854", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make microwave treacle pudding?", "Response A": "Sure, you\u2019ll want to put about a half cup of dark brown sugar and two tablespoons of blackstrap molasses in a microwave-safe dish. Then you\u2019ll want to microwave it on high for about two minutes, until the sugar is melted and the mixture is bubbling. After that, you\u2019ll want to stir the mixture until it is smooth, and then you\u2019ll want to microwave it for another minute. Make sure you stir it well after this step, and then you want to microwave it for another minute, and then stir it again. You want to repeat this process two more times. After the final step, you want to stir the mixture well, and then you want to microwave it on high for one minute. After that, you want to stir in a quarter cup of milk, and microwave the pudding for one more minute, until it\u2019s warm and thick.  You want to let the pudding sit for about five minutes before serving, to allow it to set up.", "Response B": "It\u2019s a simple recipe, but you\u2019ll need some treacle, milk, butter, and breadcrumbs.  First, put the treacle in a bowl and microwave it on high for 30 seconds.  Then add milk and butter and microwave for another 30 seconds.  Finally, add breadcrumbs and mix well.  Serve immediately."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 13}, "label_annotations": {"email": "634fde191ed73d0409412077_64b16854e93b2e93f6a75df1", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "2", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 53s "}}
