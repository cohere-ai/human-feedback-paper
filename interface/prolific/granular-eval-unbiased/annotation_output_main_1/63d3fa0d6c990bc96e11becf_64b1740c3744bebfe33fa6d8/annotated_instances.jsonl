{"id": "546", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to spot an online scam?", "Response A": "Ask yourself: do they require you to pay money up front?\nAsk yourself: do they promise that you will become rich overnight?\nAsk yourself: what's in it for them?\nAsk yourself: how are they making money?\nAnother sign of a scam is a buy-now statement like \"I can't keep this information online forever, so you have 3 hours to make your choice.\"\nTruth is, scammers usually don't get rich on their scams, either.", "Response B": "Sure! Scammers often use a variety of tactics, but there are a few common warning signs to watch out for. First, if a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. If someone is promising you a huge reward or benefit for little effort, it\u2019s probably a scam. A common ploy is to get you to pay upfront for a chance to earn money later, but the promised income rarely materializes. Another common tactic is to pressure you into acting immediately, often by creating a sense of urgency or panic. Scammers often use social media to spread their messages, so be wary of any messages you receive that seem overly optimistic or negative, as well as any that promise easy money. If you\u2019re ever unsure whether something is a scam, you can always check with the Better Business Bureau or the Federal Trade Commission. If you spot a scam, don\u2019t engage with the scammers, and be sure to report it to the appropriate authorities."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 7}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d3fa0d6c990bc96e11becf_64b1740c3744bebfe33fa6d8", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "5", "feedback": "Response \"B\" is better because it explains scams a little better than the \"A\" side.
