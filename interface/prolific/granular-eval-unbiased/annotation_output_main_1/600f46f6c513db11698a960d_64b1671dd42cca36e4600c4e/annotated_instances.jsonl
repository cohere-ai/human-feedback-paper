If you want to protect yourself, you can use a few basic principles.  First, you should be aware of any \u201cscammers\u201d who are trying to trick you into giving them money or information.  There are lots of different types of scammers, but some of the most common are people who try to get you to pay money for something you don\u2019t actually want or need.  Or they try to trick you into giving them information about yourself that they can use to steal your identity.
