The Bank of Korea kept the country's key interest rate unchanged this month, expressing concerns about the growing burden of debt repayments on households and the negative effect this could have on the economy. The governor of the Bank of Korea also said that further rate hikes by the Bank of Korea would make the situation of household debt worse, and that the central bank would prioritise risk management in the face of increasing internal and external uncertainties."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 19}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63f8a51d30e2b7501f33e8ce_64b189d77e1b7c69e8adea0d", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "2", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 56s "}}
