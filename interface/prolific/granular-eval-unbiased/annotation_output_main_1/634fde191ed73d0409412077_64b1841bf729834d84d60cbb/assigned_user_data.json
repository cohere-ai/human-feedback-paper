First of all, you want to buy clothes that fit you well.  Then, you want to buy clothes that are comfortable, and also look good on you.  You also want to buy clothes that are high quality, so they last a long time.  Finally, you want to buy clothes that are reasonably priced, so you don\u2019t spend too much money.

You might also want to consider what sort of impression you want to make on others, and choose clothes that are appropriate for that.  For example, if you want to look professional, you might want to choose clothes that are neat and well-fitting, like a suit.  If you want to look stylish, you might want to choose clothes that are fashionable and flattering, like a dress.  If you want to look sporty, you might want to choose clothes that are comfortable and practical, like workout clothes.  And if you want to look sexy, you might want to choose clothes that are flattering and alluring, like a tight dress or a low-cut top."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 21}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to choose good clothes?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure, I can help you choose good clothes.
