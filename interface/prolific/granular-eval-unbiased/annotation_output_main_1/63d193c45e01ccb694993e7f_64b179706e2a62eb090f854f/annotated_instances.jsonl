He explained that EVs would not have the much-requested 500 mile range any time soon due to current constraints in battery technology. However, he did offer a potential solution, suggesting the possibility of a trailer with an auxiliary battery, something that could be \"rented here and dropped off there\". A small trailer could be an interim solution to the range anxiety problem until battery tech catches up, particularly if it could provide some extra cargo space as well.", "Response B": "Line listed its cryptocurrency Link on the exchange platform Bitbox on a minimum of USD5 to start trading.\nBy doing so Line envisions the possibility of growth and visibility for its token as well as keep developing Bitbox."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": "distractor_15"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d193c45e01ccb694993e7f_64b179706e2a62eb090f854f", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "1", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 9s "}}
