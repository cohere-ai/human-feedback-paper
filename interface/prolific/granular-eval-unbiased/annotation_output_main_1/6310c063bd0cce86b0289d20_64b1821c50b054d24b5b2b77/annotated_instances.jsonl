{"id": "1266", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to spot an online scam?", "Response A": "Sure! Scammers often use a variety of tactics, but there are a few common warning signs to watch out for. First, if a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. If someone is promising you a huge reward or benefit for little effort, it\u2019s probably a scam. A common ploy is to get you to pay upfront for a chance to earn money later, but the promised income rarely materializes. Another common tactic is to pressure you into acting immediately, often by creating a sense of urgency or panic. Scammers often use social media to spread their messages, so be wary of any messages you receive that seem overly optimistic or negative, as well as any that promise easy money. If you\u2019re ever unsure whether something is a scam, you can always check with the Better Business Bureau or the Federal Trade Commission. If you spot a scam, don\u2019t engage with the scammers, and be sure to report it to the appropriate authorities.", "Response B": "Sure, I can help you.  If you want to protect yourself, you can use a few basic principles.  First, you should be aware of any \u201cscammers\u201d who are trying to trick you into giving them money or information.  There are lots of different types of scammers, but some of the most common are people who try to get you to pay money for something you don\u2019t actually want or need.  Or they try to trick you into giving them information about yourself that they can use to steal your identity.  So you should be careful about what information you give out, and you should be careful about how you give it out."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 7}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6310c063bd0cce86b0289d20_64b1821c50b054d24b5b2b77", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 12s "}}
