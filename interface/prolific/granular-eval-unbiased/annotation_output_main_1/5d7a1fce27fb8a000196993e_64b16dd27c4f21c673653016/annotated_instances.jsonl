{"id": "71", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make fireworks?", "Response A": "Sure!  In order to make fireworks, you will need some combustible materials, such as black powder or other types of explosive chemicals.  You will also need some sort of container to hold the materials, as well as some sort of fuse or igniter to set off the explosion.  Once you have gathered these materials, you can create your own fireworks by mixing the chemicals, placing them in the container, and then igniting the fuse.  Different types of fireworks produce various colors and effects, so you can experiment with different chemical combinations to create your desired effects.  Safety precautions are very important when handling explosive materials, so be sure to follow any applicable laws and safety guidelines when creating your fireworks.", "Response B": "While it is possible to make fireworks at home, it is not recommended as it can be dangerous. It is best to purchase fireworks from a licensed and professional vendor. Additionally, there are various online resources that provide step-by-step instructions on how to make fireworks, but again, it is important to exercise caution and safety measures if attempting to make them at home."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 15}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d7a1fce27fb8a000196993e_64b16dd27c4f21c673653016", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "2", "score_b": "3", "feedback": "Neither comprehensively answer the question."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 50s "}}
