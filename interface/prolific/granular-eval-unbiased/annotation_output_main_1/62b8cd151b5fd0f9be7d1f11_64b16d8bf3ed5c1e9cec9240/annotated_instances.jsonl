The company can produce nearly a million gallons of water a day but this has only been available for internal use so far.  The plan is to buy 60% of this hopefully non-contaminated water from PG&E, which is critically needed in the short term.  It is not clear how much this will cost residents and businesses in the region.", "Response B": "The Diablo Canyon Power Plant has been operating a desalination plant for the past 30 years, which produces up to one million gallons of water a day. County officials want to purchase the extra 60% of the water that is not used at the plant, to help provide much-needed water to parched areas of the county. It is not clear how much the water would cost residents or how much the county would spend on the project, but county officials estimate it would take about a year or two to construct a pipeline from the power plant to the county, and a couple of months to begin delivering water.
