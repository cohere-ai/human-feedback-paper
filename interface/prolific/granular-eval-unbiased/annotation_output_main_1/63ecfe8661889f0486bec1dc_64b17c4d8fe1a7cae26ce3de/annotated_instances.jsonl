Additionally, you can level up faster by using the Dark Aura soul, which increases the amount of experience gained from defeated enemies. Another strategy is to fight enemies with weaker souls equipped, as they will give out more experience points when defeated.", "Response B": "Sure, to reach level 99 in Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, you need to complete all of the game's main quests, including the final boss fight.
