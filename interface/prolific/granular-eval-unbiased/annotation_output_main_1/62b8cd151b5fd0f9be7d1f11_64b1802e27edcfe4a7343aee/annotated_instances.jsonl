This is only the second interest rate increase since June 2006.\n\n/ EPA-Yonhap\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve's rate hike and warnings of more hikes next year are heightening concerns that the upward rate spiral might light the fuse of the record household debt bomb here.\n\nThe Fed's tightening of its monetary policy could throw the nation into a more vicious cycle where households spend less due to their growing burden of debt payment, companies slash their investment further, and exports continue to fall on weaker global demand, leaving the economy mired in weaker, jobless growth.\n\nThe Bank of Korea (BOK) kept its key rate unchanged at 1.25 percent for this month, Thursday, after the U.S. Fed raised its rate by 25 basis points to 0.5-0.75 percent.

The Bank of Korea kept the country's key interest rate unchanged this month, expressing concerns about the growing burden of debt repayments on households and the negative effect this could have on the economy. The governor of the Bank of Korea also said that further rate hikes by the Bank of Korea would make the situation of household debt worse, and that the central bank would prioritise risk management in the face of increasing internal and external uncertainties.", "Response B": "The Bank of Korea (BOK) is stuck in a bind between a slowdown in the economy and the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate hikes, which could light the fuse of the record household debt bomb here.\n\nThe Fed's tightening of its monetary policy could throw the nation into a more vicious cycle where households spend less due to their growing burden of debt payment, companies slash their investment further, and exports continue to fall on weaker global demand, leaving the economy mired in weaker, jobless growth.\n\nThe BOK kept its key rate unchanged at 1.25 percent for this month, Thursday, after the U.S. Fed raised its rate by 25 basis points to 0.5-0.75 percent.
