However, the drinkable water it is making, is only used at the power plant.\"It is our drinking water, it is the water we use in the kitchen, we operate it in the plant, it is all the water we use on site,\" says Tom Jones, who oversees the desal facility at the power plant. \"The water started in the Pacific, went through our water treatment plant -- it is a water desalination facility.The harsh drought leaving a dry mark on the state, officials say this water can be used for much more than the plant's uses.In the state of California, this is the largest operating desalination plant that can produce up to one million gallons of water a day, butHill does not want that extra water to go waste. He says his plan is to buy the extra 60 percent from PG&E.With the depleting reservoirs, time is of the essence.\"It would be a couple months to a year or two,\" says Jones. \"We would have to construct a pipeline from Diablo Canyon to the front gate which is about seven and a half miles,County officials say the first priority areas are the South County basins.

The plant produces about 1 million gallons of water a day, and the county would like to buy the extra 60 percent that is not used at the power plant. The first priority areas for the extra water would be the South County basins, followed by Los Osos. Eventually, the county hopes to expand the plant and sell the water to neighboring counties.", "Response B": "Desperation for a new water supply due to droughts in California has lead the San Luis Obispo Counter Supervisors to approach the PG&E's Diablo Canyon Power Plant.  The company can produce nearly a million gallons of water a day but this has only been available for internal use so far.  The plan is to buy 60% of this hopefully non-contaminated water from PG&E, which is critically needed in the short term.
