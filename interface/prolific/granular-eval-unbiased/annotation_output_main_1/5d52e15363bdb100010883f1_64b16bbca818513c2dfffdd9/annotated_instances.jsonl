Some people experience physical symptoms like muscle tension, headaches, or stomach problems. Others experience emotional symptoms like anxiety, anger, or depression. And some people experience both types of symptoms. If you notice yourself experiencing any of these symptoms on a regular basis, it may be a sign that you are under stress.
