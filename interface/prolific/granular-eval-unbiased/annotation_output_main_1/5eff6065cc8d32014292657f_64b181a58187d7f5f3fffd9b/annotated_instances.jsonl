Additionally, you can level up faster by using the Dark Aura soul, which increases the amount of experience gained from defeated enemies. Another strategy is to fight enemies with weaker souls equipped, as they will give out more experience points when defeated."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 17}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5eff6065cc8d32014292657f_64b181a58187d7f5f3fffd9b", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 47s "}}
