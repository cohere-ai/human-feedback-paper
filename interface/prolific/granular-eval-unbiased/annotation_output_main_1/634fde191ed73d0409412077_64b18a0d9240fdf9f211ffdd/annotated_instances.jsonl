It\u2019s a good idea to figure out what you want to sell, and what you want to make.  You might want to check out your local craft stores, and see if there are any opportunities you can take advantage of.

First, you\u2019ll need to create a sewing pattern.  You can do this by drawing your design on paper, or using computer-aided design (CAD) software.  Then you\u2019ll need to make a prototype of your design, so you can test it and make sure it works correctly.  Next, you\u2019ll need to create a production version of your design, and make a few samples to show potential customers.  Finally, you\u2019ll need to set up a website and marketing materials to promote your business.
