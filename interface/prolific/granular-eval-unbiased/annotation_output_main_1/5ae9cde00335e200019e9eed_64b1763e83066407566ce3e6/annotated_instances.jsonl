Presumably, the addition of thermal-imaging capabilities to its higher-end drones is meant to lock down that market, not make it easier to hunt and kill humans. Presumably.\n\nDJI has partenered up with thermal-imaging manufacturer FLIR to produce the Zenmuse XT, a thermal-imaging camera that will integrate onto the gimbal on DJI's existing Inspire 1 and Matrice 100 drones. That means all the advantages that DJI has become famous for\u2014stupid-simple operation, live-streaming first-person video and good performance\u2014will transfer over to a thermal-imaging platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn turn, that should open new kinds of possibilities for users. Sure, it would be fun to blast around with a thermal-imaging camera as a hobby; but for search-and-rescue, firefighting or construction workers, it could add a genuinely game-changing capability.\n\nThere's no word on price, but the existing Zenmuse X5 camera already costs thousands of dollars, and thermal-imaging cameras are not normally synonymous with 'cheap'. Wait and see how many organs you'll have to sell off: availability is expected in the first part of 2016.\n\nG/O Media may get a commission 10% off 10% off Wish A gift for literally everybody.\n\nGifts under $20, $10, and even $5.

DJI will use its Inspire 1 and Matrice 100 drones, equipping them with thermal-imaging cameras, which will be useful for search-and-rescue missions, firefighting and in the construction industry. The partnership will transform aerial imaging for the industry, using DJI's expertise in camera stabilisation and long range video transmission. Firefighters using aerial thermal imagery technology explain that it helps identify which areas of the building are most affected by a fire, helping them see how the fire has affected the roof of the building and where it has spread to before anyone enters the building. Aerial thermal imaging has also become popular in the agriculture sector for crop management. Farmers are using the technology to help plan irrigation schedules, estimate fruit yields, and detect diseases.", "Response B": "Statoil will buy a 25% stake in the Roncador oil field off Brazil from Petroleo Brasileiro (Petrobras) for as much as $2.9bn, tripling its presence in its biggest growth market outside Norway. The Campos Basin field still holds recoverable resources of more than 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent after producing since the 1990s, Statoil said. Statoil has taken advantage of lower asset prices during crude's slump and a Petrobras divestment program to build its position in Brazil."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_22"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed_64b1763e83066407566ce3e6", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "1"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 25s "}}
