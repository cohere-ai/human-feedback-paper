{"id": "788", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to calculate asset to debt ratio?", "Response A": "To calculate the asset to debt ratio, you need to divide the total assets of a business by its total liabilities. This will give you a ratio that represents the proportion of assets that are financed by debt. A lower debt-to-asset ratio is usually preferred as it indicates a more financially stable business.", "Response B": "Certainly! The asset to debt ratio is a financial metric used to measure the relationship between a company's assets and its debts.  To calculate the ratio, you first need to determine the company's total assets and total debts.  Then, you divide the company's total assets by its total debts to get the asset to debt ratio.  A higher asset to debt ratio indicates that a company has a healthier financial position, since it has more assets to use to pay off its debts."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 14}, "label_annotations": {"email": "60cc30fe65c26745707fb08c_64b16aff336d34ddb8ade9ea", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "4", "feedback": "they are one sided (and each response gives a different side) but response B is easier to understand "}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 53s "}}
