The plant, which was built in 1990 and has been operating for 30 years, produces drinkable water for use in the power plant and is the only new water source in the county. The county has plans to buy the water on a long-term basis, with the first priority being to supply water to the South County basins and the Los Osos area. The county estimates that the project will cost between $10m and $20m, and that it will take between six months and a year to get the water to the front gate of the plant.", "Response B": "The County of San Luis Obispo is considering purchasing the water produced by PG&E's Diablo Canyon desalination plant to use in drought-stricken areas. The plant produces about 1 million gallons of water a day, and the county would like to buy the extra 60 percent that is not used at the power plant. The first priority areas for the extra water would be the South County basins, followed by Los Osos.
