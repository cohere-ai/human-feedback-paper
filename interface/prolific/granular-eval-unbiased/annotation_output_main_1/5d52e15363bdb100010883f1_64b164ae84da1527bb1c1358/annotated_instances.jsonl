{"id": "940", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to deal with an ex boyfriend who wants more space?", "Response A": "Sure, I can explain a bit about what \u201cspace\u201d means in a relationship, and how you might be able to work with that.  Space is a common request in relationships, and it basically means that the person wants some time and emotional space from you.  It can be difficult to hear that someone wants space from you, especially if you\u2019ve been very close, but it can be very healthy to give each other space from time to time.  Space can help you both to focus on yourself, and also to miss each other, which can help strengthen the relationship.  One way to do that is to try to respect your ex\u2019s desire for space, and not contact him or try to force a connection.  You could also try to take some time for yourself to focus on your own interests and hobbies, so that you\u2019re not constantly thinking about him.  Hope that helps!", "Response B": "Respect his wishes.\nDefine rules about phone and other e-contact.\nDevelop approaches for social interactions.\nReach an agreement.\nPrevent outbursts.\nExamine why.\nClarify finality.\nConsider your compatibility.This may be an occasion when you are simply not compatible.\nLet off some steam.\nWork the process.\nDetermine the emotional need he fulfilled.\nAppreciate the positive qualities and learning experiences.\nSay goodbye.\nGain perspective.\nFight insecurities.\nBuild self-esteem through specific events.\nExplore your options.\nSeek professional help.\nRenew your belief in healthy relationships.When you feel up to it, reaffirm that you believe in the possibility of having a healthy relationship.\nAllow for sad moments.\nRemind the world.\nWelcome him back with conditions.\nBe self-reliant.Happiness is an inside job and you are responsible to create it."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 22}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d52e15363bdb100010883f1_64b164ae84da1527bb1c1358", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 39s "}}
