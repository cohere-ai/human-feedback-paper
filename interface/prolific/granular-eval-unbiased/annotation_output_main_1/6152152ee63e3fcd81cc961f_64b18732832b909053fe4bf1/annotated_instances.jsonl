You\u2019ll need to mix together some flour, sugar, eggs, milk, and vanilla extract.  Then, mix in some oil and water, and stir in some baking soda and salt.  Then you\u2019ll pour the batter into a greased pan, and bake it at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  When it\u2019s done, let it cool for a few minutes, and then you can make the frosting.  You\u2019ll need to mix together some sugar, butter, milk, and vanilla extract.  Then, you\u2019ll spread the frosting on top of the cupcakes.  I\u2019m not sure if you want me to explain how to make the frosting, or if you want me to just show you the ingredients and instructions for making the batter.  I\u2019m happy to do either.  Would you like me to explain how to make the frosting?"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 10}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6152152ee63e3fcd81cc961f_64b18732832b909053fe4bf1", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 26s "}}
