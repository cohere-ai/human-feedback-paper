{"id": "631", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to spot and avoid secondhand stress?", "Response A": "Sure, that sounds like a great question.  So, secondhand stress is when you\u2019re affected by the stress of someone else, without actually feeling it yourself.  For example, maybe you have a friend who is always really stressed out, and you feel that stress too.  How do you avoid that?", "Response B": "Yes, I can!  Secondhand stress is the stress you\u2019re exposed to from other people.  The best way to avoid it is to avoid those people or situations.  You can also try to reduce your own stress by doing things that are relaxing for you.  These include exercise, meditation, and spending time with friends or family.  You can also try to reduce your stress by focusing on your own goals and achievements, rather than on what other people are doing.  Finally, you can try to reduce your stress by getting enough sleep and eating a healthy diet."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 23}, "label_annotations": {"email": "62b8cd151b5fd0f9be7d1f11_64b170e6816f8f51aa0f858d", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "2", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 34s "}}
