First, you should be aware of any \u201cscammers\u201d who are trying to trick you into giving them money or information.  There are lots of different types of scammers, but some of the most common are people who try to get you to pay money for something you don\u2019t actually want or need.

So you should be careful about what information you give out, and you should be careful about how you give it out.", "Response B": "There are several ways to spot an online scam.
