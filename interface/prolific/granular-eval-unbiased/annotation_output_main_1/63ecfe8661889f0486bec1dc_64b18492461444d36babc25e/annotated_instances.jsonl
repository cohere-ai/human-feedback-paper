{"id": "1187", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Gaming camera could aid MS treatment\n\n\"The Kinect camera appealed to us because it was inexpensive, portable and easy-to-use,\" McGill University postdoctoral fellow Farnood Gholami told Digital Trends. \"We developed a framework which means that when a patient walks in front of the camera, our algorithm can identify whether the subject has gait abnormality or not \u2014 and also quantify that level of gait abnormality in terms of how serious it is.\"\n\nAt present, assessing these kind of walking difficulties \u2014 one of the symptoms of MS, caused by nerve damage as a result of the disease \u2014 is usually carried out by a physician. \"The challenge with this kind of diagnosis is that it can be very subjective,\" Gholami said. \"Clinicians observe the walking of a patient and, based on their expertise, assign a clinical score. The problem is that different clinicians can assign different scores to the same subject. I had the idea of coming up with a more systematic and accurate way of assessing people with this kind of gait abnormality.\"\n\nTo create their algorithm, the McGill University researchers first analyzed the movement of ten MS patients, along with ten members of a control group. By pinpointing certain gait characteristics, they were then able to come up with a tool able to distinguish between the walking patterns of people suffering from MS and those who were not.\n\n\"At this point, we've done the study to suggest this kind of framework can be useful,\" Gholami concluded \u2014 noting that the work could also make it possible to carry out similar measurements for other diseases which cause gait abnormalities, such as Parkinson's. \"The next step is to come up with a product which can be used in clinics or even for remote monitoring on the part of the patient.\n\n\"Another possible application,\" he continued, \"would be using it in pharmaceutical companies, so that it can be used to analyze the effectiveness of certain medications in terms of their improvement on people's walking. There's more studying and improvement needed for the algorithm, but we're certainly working towards creating a final product for use in the real world.\"\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Assessing walking difficulties caused by multiple sclerosis (MS) is usually carried out by physicians, but can be very subjective. Researchers at McGill University have developed an inexpensive, easy-to-use algorithm that can identify gait abnormalities and quantify the level of their severity. The tool could be used for MS diagnosis, as well as to assess the effectiveness of medications in improving walking, and could also be applied to other diseases with similar gait abnormalities, such as Parkinson's.", "Response B": "A new algorithm can detect the symptoms of multiple sclerosis by simply using a standard Kinect camera. The algorithm was developed by scientists at McGill University in Canada, who used the Kinect to track the movements of ten patients suffering from the disease. The algorithm was able to detect the difference between the walking patterns of people suffering from the disease and those who were not."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_1_repeats", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 7}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63ecfe8661889f0486bec1dc_64b18492461444d36babc25e", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 0s "}}
