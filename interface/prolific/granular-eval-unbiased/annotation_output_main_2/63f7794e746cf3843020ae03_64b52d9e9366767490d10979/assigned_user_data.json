The conductive ink is soft and stretchy, and can be stretched to three times its length without losing conductivity, which allows for the creation of flexible electronic circuits on fabric materials.  The ink could be used to create wearable electronic devices that are soft and stretchy like clothing, as well as electronic sensors and circuits embedded in textiles.  The development of the conductive ink represents a significant step forward in the field of printable electronics, and could have numerous applications in the creation of flexible electronic devices and sensors.", "Response B": "Researchers at the University of Tokyo have developed a stretchable conductive ink that can be used to print onto cloth, which could be used to create wearable devices such as a smart bra that tracks your heart rate.
