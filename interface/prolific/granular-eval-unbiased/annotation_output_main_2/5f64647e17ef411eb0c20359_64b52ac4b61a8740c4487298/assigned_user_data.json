Practice throwing and catching the ball with someone else, so you both learn how to throw and catch.\n\n2.  Practice throwing and catching the ball with a wall or other solid object, so you learn how to throw and catch accurately.\n\n3.  Practice throwing and catching the ball with a rebounder, so you learn how to throw and catch accurately with a moving target.\n\n4.

You want to practice catching the ball in both hands, and then also with your right hand, and then with your left hand.
