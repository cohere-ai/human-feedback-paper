{"id": "841", "input_text": {"Prompt": "While Elon Musk was entertaining a crowd of avid Tesla supporters at the company's store in Paris, he asked what improvements to the Model S they would like to see. Several guests said they would like the car to have more range. \"How much range do you want?\", Musk asked.\n\nThe answers he got were mainly within the 800 to 850 kilometer ball park, which translates to about 500 miles. Elon appeared taken aback. He explained that a battery with that much range would be extremely heavy, expensive, and impractical for normal driving due to its weight.\n\nThe most challenging aspect of selecting a battery that meets the needs of everyday consumers is finding the perfect balance between range, weight, and cost. Musk told his audience that modest improvements in battery range will take place over the next year, and result in batteries that deliver 500 kilometers of range or 300 miles. Musk has stated in the past that battery capacity would increase by approximately 5% a year for the foreseeable future, if not slightly more as Tesla's Gigafactory begins driving down cost of battery production via economies of scale.\n\nWhat followed was an idea that Elon tossed out, something he hasn't mentioned before, although others have. \"What if you had a trailer with a booster battery that you could use for long distance driving?\" he asked. Then he told the audience that he was running on about 1 hour of sleep in the past 48 hours and might not be thinking clearly. But the notion of a tag-along trailer with an auxiliary battery makes a lot of sense for those times when people are driving long distances and really do need more range.\n\nTesla's battery swapping station at Harris Ranch, CA has been the site for its pilot battery swap program, but that would be a lot more complex than hooking up a trailer and then dropping it off when it was no longer needed. Some sort of rental program would be easy to create.\n\nYou can see the entire Q&A session with Elon Musk beginning at the 11 minute mark.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk was asked by supporters in Paris about improvements they would like to see in the Model S. While many mentioned increased range, Musk said that was not practical. Instead, he suggested a trailer with a booster battery for long distance driving.", "Response B": "Tesla's plans to increase the range of its electric vehicles (EVs) are being hampered by its battery's weight, but it has found a way to make the batteries lighter. The company has developed a new battery pack that is 20% lighter than its previous packs, making it lighter and cheaper to manufacture. The new battery pack is expected to be available in the coming year, and will allow Tesla to increase the range of its EV to around 300 miles. The company's battery technology is likely to improve by around 5% per year for the foreseeable future, which is a rate of improvement that is \"pretty much guaranteed\", according to Musk."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 33}, "label_annotations": {"email": "566feba6b937e400052d33b2_64b528af8269352bacc100a3", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "2", "score_b": "5", "feedback": "nothing to add"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 9s "}}
