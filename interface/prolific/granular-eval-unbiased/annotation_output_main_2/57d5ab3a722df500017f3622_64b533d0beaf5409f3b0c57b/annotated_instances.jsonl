{"id": "48", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to overcome a midlife crisis?", "Response A": "A midlife crisis is a period of emotional stress that occurs when a person realizes that their life is half over.  Some people cope with this by making major changes to their lives, such as changing jobs, changing relationships, or changing their appearance.  Other people cope with this by trying to accept the fact that their lives are half over, and that they will never be as young as they once were.  There is no one right way to cope with a midlife crisis, but there are some strategies that can help.  One strategy is to try to find ways to feel younger, such as by taking care of your health, or by spending time with young people.  Another strategy is to try to find ways to feel more fulfilled, such as by finding a new hobby, or by volunteering for a cause you believe in.  Finally, some people find that talking to a therapist can help them work through their midlife crisis.", "Response B": "A midlife crisis can be a difficult time, but there are some things you can do to overcome it. First, try to identify what is causing the crisis, which could be a range of factors such as work stress, relationship issues, or an existential crisis. Then, try to work on those issues and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist. It's also important to remember that change is a natural part of life, and there are many opportunities to reinvent yourself and make positive changes. Finally, focus on self-care and try to find new hobbies or activities that you enjoy to help you through this difficult time."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 39}, "label_annotations": {"email": "57d5ab3a722df500017f3622_64b533d0beaf5409f3b0c57b", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 46s "}}
