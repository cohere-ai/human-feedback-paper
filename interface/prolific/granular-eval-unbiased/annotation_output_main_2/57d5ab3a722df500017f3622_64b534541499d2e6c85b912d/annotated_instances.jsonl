A multi-shielded design (two 95% copper braids and 100% aluminum Mylar foil) provide optimum isolation from EMI and RFI interference for enhanced picture clarity. A nitrogen-injected foam dielectric maintains 75 Ohm impedance for optimum video signal transfer while the solid 99.97% pure, silver-coated, oxygen-free, copper center conductor provides exceptional signal transfer for accurate video reproduction. 3' length.\r\nProduct features:\r\n*24K gold plating\r\n*Precision machined 8 segment connectors\r\n*Nitrogen injected dielectric\r\n*Multi-shielded design\r\n*Pure silver coated oxygen-free copper", "Response B": "The PR190N is a 3-piece component video cable that features 24K gold plated connectors. This high-end cable is designed to deliver the best possible picture and sound quality. The PR190N is a high-performance component video cable designed for use with HD TVs. It features a pure silver-coated oxygen-free copper core, which provides high signal clarity and resistance to signal interference. The cable is also multi-shielded, which protects the signal from interference. The PR190N comes with precision machined 8- segment connectors, which make it easy to connect to your TV."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "amazon", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 42}, "label_annotations": {"email": "57d5ab3a722df500017f3622_64b534541499d2e6c85b912d", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 48s "}}
