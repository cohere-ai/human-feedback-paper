The company, which has been described as a 'Dropbox alternative\", has headquarters in Ontario, Canada. The company has a broad customer base with around 100,000 users globally. It bills itself as a \"fully encrypted, zero-knowledge cloud service that makes it easy to store, share and access the files from everywhere \u2013 with guaranteed privacy.\" Its adoption of Bitcoin payments adds additional flexibility for customers when paying for services.Bitcoin is a digital/crypto-currency that is gaining acceptance and popularity. The value of bitcoins changes based on a range of mathematical formulas. Its value reached a peak of $1,100 per coin in December 2013 but then dropped sharply. Its present value moves around the $228 per coin mark. Bitcoin is not without controversy. In February 2014 Bitcoin provider MtGox collapsed leading to some to call it a \"digital Ponzi scheme\". However, it is now much closer to being regarded as mainstream, and has customers that include a range of web hosts and major companies like PayPal and Microsoft. The news that Sync.com is now accepting Bitcoin indicates that the cryptocurrency is gaining momentum.\"Sync offers a completely private alternative to consumer-grade cloud storage services such as Dropbox, through the use of zero-knowledge encryption,\" explained Sync's CEO, Thomas Savundra. \"Simply put, we can't access the data stored on our servers and with Bitcoin, our customers can enjoy absolute privacy in the cloud for both their data and payments.\"\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Tesla's CEO recently spoke in Paris, and one of the topics he covered was how to improve range, or reduce range anxiety, in electric vehicles. He explained that EVs would not have the much-requested 500 mile range any time soon due to current constraints in battery technology. However, he did offer a potential solution, suggesting the possibility of a trailer with an auxiliary battery, something that could be \"rented here and dropped off there\". A small trailer could be an interim solution to the range anxiety problem until battery tech catches up, particularly if it could provide some extra cargo space as well.", "Response B": "Encrypted cloud storage and file sharing firm Sync.com, a 'Dropbox alternative' that has over 100,000 individual and business users globally, has begun accepting Bitcoin as a payment method.

Simply put, we can't access the data stored on our servers.
