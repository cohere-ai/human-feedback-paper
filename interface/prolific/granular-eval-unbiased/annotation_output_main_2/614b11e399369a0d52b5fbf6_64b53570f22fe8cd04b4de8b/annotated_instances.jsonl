This can be useful if you want to watch two videos at the same time, or if you want to multitask. To use picture-in-picture, open two videos in YouTube or another video player. Then press the picture-in-picture button. The videos will play side-by-side. You can resize the windows or move them around to suit your needs. You can also close the video player or switch to another app, and the videos will keep playing in the background. To exit picture-in-picture, press the exit button.", "Response B": "Sure, I\u2019m happy to help!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 34}, "label_annotations": {"email": "614b11e399369a0d52b5fbf6_64b53570f22fe8cd04b4de8b", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "1"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 5s "}}
