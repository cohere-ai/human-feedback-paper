A good first song is Heart of Gold by Neil Young.  You might also want to look at some free online lessons.  A good website for that is www.musicianship.com", "Response B": "Begin with chromatics at a tempo of 120 BPM (or 60 BPM if you're just starting out), one note per beat.\nAfter the chromatics, do whole-steps on each string, four notes per string, one finger per note per string, to help with the stretching and warming up.\nGo to the 12th fret of your highest pitched string and begin doing 8 full bends with each finger on that string, alternating after every four.\nBegin playing scales, in one key, at 120 (or 60) beats per minute, one note per beat.\nBegin playing different scales in one key and different positions at 120 BPM without skipping a beat.\nTake a scale you know all modes of, and choose a key.\nFind the fastest tempo you can play in time and chose and scale and play every mode of it."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 43}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5b1efc25bdf4e1000163af46_64b534e51c1c229b2aff5aae", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 15s "}}
