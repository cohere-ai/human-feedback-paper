First, try to identify what is causing the crisis, which could be a range of factors such as work stress, relationship issues, or an existential crisis. Then, try to work on those issues and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist. It's also important to remember that change is a natural part of life, and there are many opportunities to reinvent yourself and make positive changes. Finally, focus on self-care and try to find new hobbies or activities that you enjoy to help you through this difficult time.", "Response B": "Face your problems.\nFind new goals.\nAppreciate the life you have.\nMake informed choices.\nGet some advice.\nMove forward, not backward.\nSpend some time alone.\nRelax.\nAvoid turning to alcohol and drugs.\nWork through depression and anxiety.\nJournal.\nSee a therapist."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 39}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to overcome a midlife crisis?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            A midlife crisis can be a difficult time, but there are some things you can do to overcome it.
