I have to sit through it, so you do, too. Even if it's a little boring, it's important for me to be here. I have to listen carefully, take notes and then interview some of the speakers afterward. I work for the Daily News after all. Didn't you bring anything to read?\nJane: I brought my iPod and some headphones. Would it be rude to listen to some music?\nFrida: Yes, it would. I might have a few old newspapers in my bag. You could read them. They also have sections with games in them, like crossword puzzles. That will keep you busy for a while.\nJane: I hate crosswords. Do the papers have comic sections in them?\nFrida: You'll probably find some. Now be quiet! Another man is getting up to speak. I really have to pay attention to this one. It's the head of the charity organization.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "Jane is bored at a charity event and would rather listen to music through her headphones or read a newspaper.
