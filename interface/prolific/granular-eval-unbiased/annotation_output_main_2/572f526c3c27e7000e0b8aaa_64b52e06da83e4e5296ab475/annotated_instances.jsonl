Some of the key features include 24K gold plating for superior conductivity, precision machined 8 segment connectors for a secure connection, and nitrogen injected dielectric and multi-shielding for enhanced signal clarity and noise rejection.  These cables are also made with pure silver coated oxygen-free copper wiring for enhanced signal transmission.  Overall this sounds like a high quality, high performance cable that will deliver exceptional audio and video performance!", "Response B": "AR Pro Series II component video cable carries signals along three separate paths to achieve optimum picture quality. 24K gold-plated, split center pin and an 8 segment RCA connector delivers precise connections and lowers signal resistance for enhanced picture clarity. A multi-shielded design (two 95% copper braids and 100% aluminum Mylar foil) provide optimum isolation from EMI and RFI interference for enhanced picture clarity. A nitrogen-injected foam dielectric maintains 75 Ohm impedance for optimum video signal transfer while the solid 99.97% pure, silver-coated, oxygen-free, copper center conductor provides exceptional signal transfer for accurate video reproduction. 3' length.\r\nProduct features:\r\n*24K gold plating\r\n*Precision machined 8 segment connectors\r\n*Nitrogen injected dielectric\r\n*Multi-shielded design\r\n*Pure silver coated oxygen-free copper"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "amazon", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 42}, "label_annotations": {"email": "572f526c3c27e7000e0b8aaa_64b52e06da83e4e5296ab475", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 41s "}}
