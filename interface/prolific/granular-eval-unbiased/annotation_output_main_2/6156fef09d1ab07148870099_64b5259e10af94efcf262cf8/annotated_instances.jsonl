{"id": "92", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to overcome a midlife crisis?", "Response A": "A midlife crisis can be a difficult time, but there are some things you can do to overcome it. First, try to identify what is causing the crisis, which could be a range of factors such as work stress, relationship issues, or an existential crisis. Then, try to work on those issues and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist. It's also important to remember that change is a natural part of life, and there are many opportunities to reinvent yourself and make positive changes. Finally, focus on self-care and try to find new hobbies or activities that you enjoy to help you through this difficult time.", "Response B": "Sure, I\u2019ll tell you what I know about this.  A midlife crisis is a period of intense emotional distress that\u2019s often triggered by major life changes, such as becoming an empty-nester, or a divorce.  You may feel like you\u2019re facing some sort of \u201c squirrels\u201d problem, where you\u2019re trying to find a new way of living, but you\u2019re not sure how to do it.  You may also feel like you\u2019re missing out on something, like the opportunity to be young again, or to have more time.  You may be experiencing an \u201cin-between\u201d feeling, where you\u2019re not sure what to do with your life, or where to turn.  This can be a very difficult time for people, and it can be hard to know where to turn."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 39}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6156fef09d1ab07148870099_64b5259e10af94efcf262cf8", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 7m 21s "}}
