Otherwise, they \"will no longer be able to access parliamentary infrastructure or internal digital services.\"\n\nPoilievre has been very active on social media platforms in the last year -- since he announced his intention to run for the party's leadership -- and uses them largely to speak directly to his base through his widely viewed and shared videos.\n\nPoilievre has now scrapped his TikTok account, where he had more than 236,000 followers, entirely.
