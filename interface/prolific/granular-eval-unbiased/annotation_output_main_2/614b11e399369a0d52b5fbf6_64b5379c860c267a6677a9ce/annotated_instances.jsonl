{"id": "360", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Given the document below, determine if the summary is factually consistent with the document. \nDocument: The boss of pizza giant Domino's has admitted the company failed to get the balance right when it upped delivery prices to counter inflation after the business reported first-half profits dropped by more than 20 per cent.\n\nThe company said its plans to fight inflation \"had not been optimal\" in the first half, with decisions to increase product prices and delivery and surcharge fees impacting how often customers ordered, particularly in overseas markets such as Japan and Germany.\n\n\"We haven't always had the balance right for some customer groups\": Domino's Pizza CEO Don Meij.\n\n\"First and foremost, we actually got delivery pricing wrong, not carry-out pricing,\" chief executive Don Meij said.\n\nHe said while shoppers had increasingly returned in-store to pick up their takeaway orders, price increases for delivery had hurt how often customers ordered pizza.\nSummary: Shares in the pizza giant have declined after a sharp dip in profit, with boss Don Meij conceding the company \"did not get the balance right\" after raising prices.\nIs the summary consistent with the document? First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "The document states that Domino's Pizza's boss Don Meij admitted that the company failed to get the balance right when it upped delivery prices to counter inflation. He said the company's plans to fight inflation had not been optimal, and the decisions to increase product prices and delivery and surcharge fees had impacted how often customers ordered, particularly in overseas markets such as Japan and Germany.\n\nThe summary accurately captures the essence of the document's main points, stating that the company did not get the balance right when it raised prices, and that the boss admitted this. It also accurately states that the company's profits declined, and that the boss was concerned about the company's performance.\n\nTherefore, the summary is factually consistent with the document.", "Response B": "The summary articulates the main points of the article, but does not express the full nuance of the piece. It fails to mention that the company also increased the prices of its products, not just delivery prices, and that this also contributed to the drop in profits. While it is factually consistent, it does not fully capture the meaning of the article. I would rate this as a \"Yes, but...\" response."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "factualnlg", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 29}, "label_annotations": {"email": "614b11e399369a0d52b5fbf6_64b5379c860c267a6677a9ce", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 55s "}}
