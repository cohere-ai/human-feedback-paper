Woodrow gets mad and somehow locked in.", "Response B": "Woodrow, a rude and impatient man, was frustrated by the ATM machine's polite and helpful responses. He wanted to withdraw money from the ATM, but the machine asked him to insert his card and input his PIN code. Woodrow became upset and yelled at the machine, accusing it of treating him like an idiot. The ATM machine tried to calm him down and help him through the process. However, Woodrow became even more agitated and accidentally selected a charity to donate his money to instead of withdrawing it. The machine realized its mistake and tried to fix it, but Woodrow refused to listen. The machine then alerted the authorities, causing Woodrow to panic and demand his money back. In the end, Woodrow was left frustrated and empty-handed."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "dialogsum", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 28}, "label_annotations": {"email": "62b44f66a16d45783569fad6_64b527ff92145c38b4bfe9e5", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "2"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 23s "}}
