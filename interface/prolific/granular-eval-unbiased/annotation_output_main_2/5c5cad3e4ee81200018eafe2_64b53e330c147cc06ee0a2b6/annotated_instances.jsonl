It has been confirmed that decommissioning of the plant could last for four decades and that compensation costs are due to be over $57 billion. Following this announcement, Japan's insurance companies stated they would push for an average 19% increase in its earthquake premiums, which are due to come into effect January 2017.  Tokyo has already given billions of dollars to the embattled company to keep it afloat whilst the mess is cleared."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_37"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5c5cad3e4ee81200018eafe2_64b53e330c147cc06ee0a2b6", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "1", "feedback": "Response B is about a different question than the one given."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 12s "}}
