{"id": "912", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Here's new tech that'll make wearables as non-invasive as a Band-Aid. Japanese researchers have created a printable conducive ink on cloth, which means your boxer briefs or sports bra could one day track your heart rate (among other things).\n\nIn an effort to make electronic wearables more, well, wearable, a team at the University of Tokyo developed the ink and announced it yesterday. In a single-step process, electrodes and wires can be printed on both surfaces of the textile using the wonder ink. This new super cloth is also way softer and stretchier than today's harder, more rigid wearables and printed electronics.Even when stretched to three times its length, the ink remained highly conducive.\n\nThis new material is somewhat similar to the conducive yarn teased at Google I/O this year, which Levi's is reportedly using to make your jeans a giant touchpad. The goal there is to swipe, pinch, tap, and drag your fingers across these smart threads to answer calls or turn off lights, just like you would on a mousepad or smartphone. (Read about our hands-on with this magic fabric here.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Tokyo researchers' ink, though, seems a lot stretchier and allows manufacturers to make wearables that'll be as skintight as fake tattoos. Yep, that's right. Tech tattoos.\n\nThe future is now.\n\nG/O Media may get a commission 10% off 10% off Wish A gift for literally everybody.\n\nGifts under $20, $10, and even $5.

The ink is made up of a liquid polymer and a carbon nanotube powder, and can be applied to both the front and back of the fabric, making it suitable for use in the manufacturing of interactive clothing. The material is more flexible than conventional electronic materials, and can be stretched to three times its length without the ink losing its conductivity.", "Response B": "A team of researchers at the University of Tokyo have developed a new conductive ink which can be printed on textile materials to create electronic circuits.  The conductive ink is soft and stretchy, and can be stretched to three times its length without losing conductivity, which allows for the creation of flexible electronic circuits on fabric materials.  The ink could be used to create wearable electronic devices that are soft and stretchy like clothing, as well as electronic sensors and circuits embedded in textiles.  The development of the conductive ink represents a significant step forward in the field of printable electronics, and could have numerous applications in the creation of flexible electronic devices and sensors."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 31}, "label_annotations": {"email": "57d5ab3a722df500017f3622_64b525f64d2aec1474cf994e", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 45s "}}
