An internal bath is a way to clean yourself when you don\u2019t have access to a shower or a bathtub. First, you\u2019ll want to get undressed and put on a clean set of underwear or pajamas. Then you\u2019ll want to fill a basin or a bowl with warm water. You\u2019ll want the water to be warm, but not hot, so that it feels comfortable on your skin. You\u2019ll want the water to be deep enough that you can submerge your underarms, and you\u2019ll also want to make sure the water isn\u2019t so deep that you\u2019ll be uncomfortable balancing it on your lap.\n\nOnce you have the water prepared, you\u2019ll want to sit on the edge of the bathtub or on a chair with your knees bent, and you\u2019ll want to lean forward so that your bottom is off the edge of the bathtub or the chair, and your thighs are parallel to the floor. Make sure you\u2019re comfortable and that you\u2019re not going to slip or fall", "Response B": "Determine what type of internal bath cleanse best suits your needs.\nGather the necessary materials.\nMix the ingredients of your cleanse.\nFill the enema bag with the cleansing concoction and insert into your colon.\nMassage your belly and move gently back and forth from the bent-over position."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 37}, "label_annotations": {"email": "57d5ab3a722df500017f3622_64b52f16096dff5d8f22539f", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "3", "feedback": "I am not sure if response B is an internal bath"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 8s "}}
