Here are some basic guidelines for eating mannerly:\n\n-Use your fork in your right hand, and your knife in your left hand.  Hold your fork loosely in your right hand, with your fingers slightly curved around the handle.  Hold your knife firmly in your left hand, with your thumb on top of the handle and your other fingers underneath.\n-Cut your food into small bites before putting it in your mouth.  Don\u2019t shovel large bites into your mouth.\n-Chew with your mouth closed.\n-Don\u2019t talk with your mouth full.\n-Put your utensils down on your plate, not on the table, when you are finished with them.\n-When you are finished eating, place your fork and knife together on the far right side of your plate, with the handles pointing inwards.  This indicates that you are finished eating and don\u2019t need your plate", "Response B": "Sit up straight at the table.This will give people a good first impression.But try not to look stiff and nervous,this will put them on edge.\nIf you are served first, do not start eating until the other guests at you table are served too.\nTo cut something,you stab your fork into it, but be careful and do this gently.\nIf you need something,do not reach across the table to get it.\nWhen or if pouring drinks,ask the people do they want refills.\nIf eating soup,do not slurp.\nDo not wave your knife, fork, spoon etc.\nWhen you burp or yawn,cover your mouth with your hand.\nDo not pick your nose.\nIf you need to fart, excuse yourself to the bathroom."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 35}, "label_annotations": {"email": "590208c89571f50001c666e3_64b534288dc295615a31a778", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 38s "}}
