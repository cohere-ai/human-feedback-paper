{"556": {"id": "556", "text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make raspberry muffins?", "Response A": "Sure, I can help you with that!  You will need the following ingredients:  1 cup of all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 cup melted butter, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.  You will also need a 9-cup baking pan.  First, preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  Then, in a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Then, in a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, eggs, milk, and vanilla extract.  Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.  Pour the batter into the 9-cup baking pan and spread it into an even layer.  Bake the muffins for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.  Let the muffins cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.  Once the muffins are completely cooled, you can store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.  Enjoy!", "Response B": "Sure!
