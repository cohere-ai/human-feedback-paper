{"id": "614", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to encourage kids to eat healthier foods?", "Response A": "Sure. One way is to tell them about the health benefits of the foods you want them to eat. For example, you could tell them that fruits and vegetables contain lots of vitamins and minerals that will help them stay healthy. You could also tell them that eating vegetables helps them grow, and that eating fruits provides them with important nutrients.", "Response B": "Sure, there are a few ways to encourage kids to eat healthier foods.  First, you can model good behavior yourself, and make healthy eating a family affair.  You can also try to make healthy eating fun, by offering kids a variety of healthy options and letting them choose what they want.  You can also try to set a good example for kids by eating healthy yourself, and by not eating unhealthy foods in front of them.  Finally, you can try to educate kids about the benefits of healthy eating, and try to get them to understand that healthy eating is important for their health."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 42}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63db6fc95731ea1965e7efeb_64b52fddeb17748db49e1604", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "2", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 1s "}}
