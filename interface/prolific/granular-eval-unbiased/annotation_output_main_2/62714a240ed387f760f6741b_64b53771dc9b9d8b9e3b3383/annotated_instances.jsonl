I've allowed qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time to keep up.\nJack: I know, but the geology of the American West is my favorite interest and I've read a lot in the field.

I really want to learn something.\nFrida: Well, I'll speak to Professor Burman, if he thinks you're ready, I'll let you enroll.\nJack: Oh, thanks. Prof. Turner, that's very nice of you.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "Jack wants to take Professor Turner's Advanced Geology course next semester.

Professor Turner will speak to Professor Burman and let Jack enroll if Professor Burman thinks he is ready.", "Response B": "In this conversation, Jack, a junior student, asks Professor Turner if she will be teaching her Advanced Geology course again next semester. She confirms that she will be, and he then asks if he can enroll in the course, even though he is only a junior. Professor Turner explains that the course is a graduate-level course and is difficult for even seniors. Jack explains that he has been interested in the geology of the American West for a long time and has been reading about it extensively. He also explains that he did not find Professor Burman's course challenging enough. Professor Turner agrees to speak with Professor Burman to see if he thinks Jack is ready for the course, and if so, she will allow him to enroll.
