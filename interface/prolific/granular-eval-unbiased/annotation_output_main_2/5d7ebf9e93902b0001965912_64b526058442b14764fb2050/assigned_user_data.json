The three-piece set of red, blue, and green cables are each 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) long.  The multi-shielded design, nitrogen injected dielectric, and pure silver coated oxygen-free copper all work together to provide an improved signal transmission.  The 24K gold plating on the precision machined 8 segment connectors ensures long-lasting, corrosion-free connections.  The male end of the cables are standard RCA connectors.", "Response B": "Wow, this sounds like an amazing cable for connecting audio and video components!  Some of the key features include 24K gold plating for superior conductivity, precision machined 8 segment connectors for a secure connection, and nitrogen injected dielectric and multi-shielding for enhanced signal clarity and noise rejection.  These cables are also made with pure silver coated oxygen-free copper wiring for enhanced signal transmission.  Overall this sounds like a high quality, high performance cable that will deliver exceptional audio and video performance!"}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "amazon", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 42}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Your client has asked you to write a product description using product features and product title below.
