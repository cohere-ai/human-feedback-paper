The three-piece set of red, blue, and green cables are each 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) long.  The multi-shielded design, nitrogen injected dielectric, and pure silver coated oxygen-free copper all work together to provide an improved signal transmission.  The 24K gold plating on the precision machined 8 segment connectors ensures long-lasting, corrosion-free connections.  The male end of the cables are standard RCA connectors.", "Response B": "Wow, this sounds like an amazing cable for connecting audio and video components!  Some of the key features include 24K gold plating for superior conductivity, precision machined 8 segment connectors for a secure connection, and nitrogen injected dielectric and multi-shielding for enhanced signal clarity and noise rejection.  These cables are also made with pure silver coated oxygen-free copper wiring for enhanced signal transmission.  Overall this sounds like a high quality, high performance cable that will deliver exceptional audio and video performance!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "amazon", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 42}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d7ebf9e93902b0001965912_64b526058442b14764fb2050", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "2", "feedback": "Felt response A was sounded much more like a product description, marked it down as the length of the cable was wrong from the description. response B sounds like a reviewer wanting to buy it"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 56s "}}
