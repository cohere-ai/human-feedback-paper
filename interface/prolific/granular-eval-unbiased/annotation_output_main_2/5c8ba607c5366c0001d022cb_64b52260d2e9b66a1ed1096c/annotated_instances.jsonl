FedEx has had to use manual processes for a \"significant portion of TNT operations and customer service functions.\" FedEx couldn't say when TNT services will be fully restored.\n\nAs for FedEx's recovery plan, the company said it focused on operations, finance, back-office, and secondary business systems. FedEx couldn't put a price tag on the attack fallout, but it did note:\n\nGiven the recent timing and magnitude of the attack, in addition to our initial focus on restoring TNT operations and customer service functions, we are still evaluating the financial impact of the attack, but it is likely that it will be material. We do not have cyber or other insurance in place that covers this attack. Although we cannot currently quantify the amounts, we have experienced loss of revenue due to decreased volumes at TNT and incremental costs associated with the implementation of contingency plans and the remediation of affected systems.\n\nThe company said it is still committed to boosting operating income by $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2017.\n\nRelated stories:\n\nAnd more on securing the mobile enterprise:\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "FedEx has stated that it is likely to suffer a material financial hit from the Petya cyber attack.

The firm said it had no insurance in place that covers the attack and could not estimate when, or even if, all services will be fully restored. Revenues have been impacted by decreased volumes at TNT, the cost of implementing contingency plans and efforts to get the affected systems back on track. Currently, while its services are available, widespread delays continue to plague TNT, which is said to be manually processing much of its operations and customer service functions."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 43}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5c8ba607c5366c0001d022cb_64b52260d2e9b66a1ed1096c", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 5s "}}
