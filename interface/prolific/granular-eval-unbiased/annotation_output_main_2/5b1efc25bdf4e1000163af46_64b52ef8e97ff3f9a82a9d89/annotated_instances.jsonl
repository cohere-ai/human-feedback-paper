{"id": "643", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to overcome a midlife crisis?", "Response A": "A midlife crisis is a period of emotional stress that occurs when a person realizes that their life is half over.  Some people cope with this by making major changes to their lives, such as changing jobs, changing relationships, or changing their appearance.  Other people cope with this by trying to accept the fact that their lives are half over, and that they will never be as young as they once were.  There is no one right way to cope with a midlife crisis, but there are some strategies that can help.  One strategy is to try to find ways to feel younger, such as by taking care of your health, or by spending time with young people.  Another strategy is to try to find ways to feel more fulfilled, such as by finding a new hobby, or by volunteering for a cause you believe in.  Finally, some people find that talking to a therapist can help them work through their midlife crisis.", "Response B": "Sure!  You\u2019re not alone -- lots of people go through midlife crises.  A midlife crisis is really just a period of transition and self-examination, often triggered by changes in life circumstances.  A common experience is feeling stuck in a rut, or questioning what you\u2019ve accomplished so far in life, and wondering if you\u2019re on the right path.  There\u2019s no one right way to get through a midlife crisis, but here are some ideas: you could try getting in touch with old friends, or making a new friend, and talking about your feelings.  You could try taking some time for yourself, to do the things that make you feel most happy and fulfilled.  You could also try making some changes in your life, like taking on a new hobby or challenge, or changing your routine in some way.  Or you could try talking to a therapist or other counselor, who can help you work through these feelings."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 39}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5b1efc25bdf4e1000163af46_64b52ef8e97ff3f9a82a9d89", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 28s "}}
