The digital age has brought a range of new technologies into schools, and that has provided new opportunities for data collection and analysis. Schools are behind other sectors in embracing this potential, however.\n\nA recent report from public policy think tank the Center for Data Innovation urged federal and state policymakers to incentivize faster adoption in schools and districts. Beyond encouraging administrators to use data to improve their operations and instructional practices, the Center for Data Innovation wants schools to get data into the hands of students and parents, giving them more agency over the learning process.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "School and district leaders have had to adapt to the digital age, with the role of K-12 chief information officers (CIOs) shifting from IT-focused to data-driven. According to District Administration, CIOs now serve as data interpreters and visionaries, facilitating understanding between technology departments and academic/operational branches of their districts and developing a long-term plan about where data fits into the district's strategic goals. They also fulfil a training role, helping educators without data backgrounds gain insights from analytics, and they break down silos by connecting people from various departments with data to meet continuous improvement goals.", "Response B": "The demand for greater transparency and accountability within K-12 has pushed educators to prioritize data-driven decision-making. As a result, the role of the CIO has evolved to include data interpreter and visionary, helping to facilitate understanding between technology departments and academic/operational branches of districts. A key responsibility for the CIO is to break down silos and connect people from various departments with data to meet continuous improvement goals.\n\nTo fulfill this new role, the CIO must have a deep understanding of how data is collected and analyzed, and an even deeper understanding of how to translate it into actionable insights for stakeholders. This requires the CIO to work closely with other district leaders to develop a long-term plan for how data can be integrated into the district's strategic goals.\n\nSource:\n\nDistrict Administration"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 25}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d06743eac143b000118ce79_64b5338c8a8ba5e0a42253c6", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 27s "}}
