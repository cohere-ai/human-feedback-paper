{"id": "253", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make 'melt and pour' soap?", "Response A": "Sure.  It\u2019s a pretty simple process, but you should read through the following instructions carefully to make sure you do it right.  First, you\u2019ll need to measure out the amount of soap base you\u2019ll need for the quantity of soap you want to make.  You\u2019ll want to make sure you have enough soap base to fill the molds you\u2019ll use, plus a little extra to account for any spillage or mistakes.  You\u2019ll also want to make sure you have enough soap to make the amount of soap you want.  You can use either a kitchen scale or a digital scale to make sure you get the right amount.  Make sure you\u2019re using the right kind of soap base, too.  You want to use a clear, white soap base that\u2019s labeled as \u2018melt and pour\u2019, and you want to make sure it\u2019s the right consistency.  You\u2019ll want to make sure it\u2019s not too hard, but also not too soft.  You want it to be easy to pour, but not so", "Response B": "To make'melt and pour' soap, you will need to follow these steps: 1. Gather your ingredients: soap base, distilled water, essential oils, and colorants (optional). 2. Chop the soap base into small pieces and place it in a microwave-safe bowl. 3. Microwave the soap for 30 seconds at a time, stirring often until it is completely melted. 4. Add a few drops of essential oils and colorants if desired. 5. Pour the mixture into a mold and let it cool completely. 6. Once it has hardened, remove the soap from the mold and enjoy!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 29}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63e51bf29e3110c635031c03_64b53af6b23fc2ee629f61e7", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "3", "feedback": "Both are good but could be formatted a little better.
