But the proof is in the cup,\" Mr Schultz said.\n\n\"In over 40 years, I can't remember a moment in time where I've been more excited, more enthused that demonstrates the pride, the quality, the passion, the heritage and the craft of what Starbucks can do.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:43 Three cups of coffee a day could help you live longer\n\nThe drinks will be available in Southern California in the spring, while the UK, Japan and the Middle East will see the range on the menu later this year.\n\nStarbucks opened its first branch in Italy in 2018, causing outcry and prompting calls for a boycott.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProtesters even set fire to palm trees planted by Starbucks in Milan.\n\nLast year pizza chain Domino's pulled out of Italy after failing to win over the ancestral home of pizza.\n\nIt had planned to open hundreds of stores by 2030, counting on its delivery model to boost popularity - but when the pandemic forced traditional pizzerias to deliver, it lost its edge.\nSummary: Starbucks faced a boycott when it first opened in Italy in 2018 - but the chain has come back swinging with an olive oil range of coffee launching in France on Wednesday.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?
