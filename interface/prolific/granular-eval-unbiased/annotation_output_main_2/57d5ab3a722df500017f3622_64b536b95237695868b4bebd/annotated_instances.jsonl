First provide detailed reasoning, then answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nReasoning:", "Response A": "The summary articulates the main points of the article, but does not express the full nuance of the piece. It fails to mention that the company also increased the prices of its products, not just delivery prices, and that this also contributed to the drop in profits. While it is factually consistent, it does not fully capture the meaning of the article. I would rate this as a \"Yes, but...\" response.", "Response B": "The document states that the company raised prices but hurt their profits in the process.
