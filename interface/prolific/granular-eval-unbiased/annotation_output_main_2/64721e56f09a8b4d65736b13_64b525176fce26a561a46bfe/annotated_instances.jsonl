Additional research shows keyboards constrain subjects that use symbols, limit creativity and increase cognitive load, and West encourages teachers to consider using digital pen and paper to capitalize on the benefits of the writing implement as well as connected and collaborative technology.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMany have bemoaned the loss of handwriting among students. Many schools are no longer required to teach cursive. Perhaps the shift has been too complete with the advent of the computer. But technology companies aren't throwing away the commitment to pen and paper.\n\nIn its release of upgrades for the 2016-17 school year, Microsoft Classroom expanded the number of color options for its stylus in OneNote and added a math assistant that can identify whether students are solving a math problem correctly, as well as show what method would lead to a correct answer. Teachers now have the opportunity to revive handwriting without foregoing the digital world.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The bankruptcy of Spain's renewable energy firm, Abengoa, highlights transition difficulties for energy firms to stable and solvent renewable energy companies.  It also, more poignantly, reveals how connected the economy is and how turbulence in the energy sector could easily spread to other sectors of the economy, thereby creating a broader economic slowdown at any given point. The company's declaration of bankruptcy sent Spanish banking shares tumbling due to concerns that the banks left holding Abengoa's debt may now face heavy losses and low recovery rates.  As the Financial Times pointed out last month, \"we don't believe that this should be viewed as a one-off.  To our minds, the events here show that Spanish banks have yet to take losses on a lot of debt\". Spanish banks are still reeling from the Eurozone crisis, and these developments will not help their quest for profitability and stability.", "Response B": "Student learning has been diminished in the switch from writing with pens to using keyboards, according to Peter West, director of eLearning at Saint Stephen's College in Australia. Research indicates that students who take lecture notes using a keyboard are more likely to transcribe content mindlessly, which tends to reduce performance on factual recall and conceptual learning. Students prefer keyboards, but pens support performance better. West suggests teachers use digital pen and paper in order to realise the benefits of using pens as well as connected technology."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": "distractor_30"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "64721e56f09a8b4d65736b13_64b525176fce26a561a46bfe", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "1", "score_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 17s "}}
