{"id": "761", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to overcome a midlife crisis?", "Response A": "Sure!  You\u2019re not alone -- lots of people go through midlife crises.  A midlife crisis is really just a period of transition and self-examination, often triggered by changes in life circumstances.  A common experience is feeling stuck in a rut, or questioning what you\u2019ve accomplished so far in life, and wondering if you\u2019re on the right path.  There\u2019s no one right way to get through a midlife crisis, but here are some ideas: you could try getting in touch with old friends, or making a new friend, and talking about your feelings.  You could try taking some time for yourself, to do the things that make you feel most happy and fulfilled.  You could also try making some changes in your life, like taking on a new hobby or challenge, or changing your routine in some way.  Or you could try talking to a therapist or other counselor, who can help you work through these feelings.", "Response B": "Sure, I\u2019ll tell you what I know about this.  A midlife crisis is a period of intense emotional distress that\u2019s often triggered by major life changes, such as becoming an empty-nester, or a divorce.  You may feel like you\u2019re facing some sort of \u201c squirrels\u201d problem, where you\u2019re trying to find a new way of living, but you\u2019re not sure how to do it.  You may also feel like you\u2019re missing out on something, like the opportunity to be young again, or to have more time.  You may be experiencing an \u201cin-between\u201d feeling, where you\u2019re not sure what to do with your life, or where to turn.  This can be a very difficult time for people, and it can be hard to know where to turn."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 39}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63ea41da5bd5ed0111145ffb_64b52b221945a12e94bf69c3", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 49s "}}
