Some people cope with this by making major changes to their lives, such as changing jobs, changing relationships, or changing their appearance.  Other people cope with this by trying to accept the fact that their lives are half over, and that they will never be as young as they once were.  There is no one right way to cope with a midlife crisis, but there are some strategies that can help.  One strategy is to try to find ways to feel younger, such as by taking care of your health, or by spending time with young people.  Another strategy is to try to find ways to feel more fulfilled, such as by finding a new hobby, or by volunteering for a cause you believe in.  Finally, some people find that talking to a therapist can help them work through their midlife crisis."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 39}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to overcome a midlife crisis?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Face your problems.<br/>Find new goals.<br/>Appreciate the life you have.<br/>Make informed choices.<br/>Get some advice.<br/>Move forward, not backward.<br/>Spend some time alone.<br/>Relax.<br/>Avoid turning to alcohol and drugs.<br/>Work through depression and anxiety.<br/>Journal.<br/>See a therapist.</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response B </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            A midlife crisis is a period of emotional stress that occurs when a person realizes that their life is half over.
