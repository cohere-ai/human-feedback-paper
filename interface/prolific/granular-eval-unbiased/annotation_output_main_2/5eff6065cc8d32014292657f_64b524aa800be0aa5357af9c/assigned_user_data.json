{"946": {"id": "946", "text": {"Prompt": "Given the document below, determine if the summary is factually consistent with the document. \nDocument: Moderna, Inc.'s revenues from its COVID-19 vaccines have begun an anticipated decline, reflecting the broader trend in drugs and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 as the pandemic begins to wind down, and it is forecasting a steep drop in coronavirus vaccine sales in 2023. But the messenger RNA-focused biotech's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings also hint that the post-pandemic future that it has been building toward is taking shape as newer mRNA-based products inch closer to the market, particularly in infectious diseases like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and oncology.\n\nModerna announced its earnings on 23 February, reporting fourth quarter revenues of $5.1bn and full year revenues of $19.3bn, nearly all of which - $4.9bn and $18.4bn, respectively - came from global sales of Spikevax.\n\nBut the firm is keen to establish itself as a multi-product company. \"The company continues to expand at a rapid pace,\" CEO Stephane Bancel told Moderna's same-day earnings call. \"We now have three commercial COVID-19 vaccine products. We have four programs in Phase III.\"\n\nHe added that the company is on track to expand its commercial portfolio \"very soon\" and overall has 48 programs underway.\n\n\"Our $18bn of cash balance at the end of the year is enabling us to scale across research, clinical development, manufacturing, commercial and G&A,\" he said.\n\nBigger Drop In Pandemic Sales To Come\n\nAlong with other drug makers that have experienced record revenues and profits from COVID-19 vaccines and drugs - such as Pfizer Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. and Gilead Sciences, Inc. - Moderna has begun to see its sales take a downward trajectory. For the fourth quarter, the sales figure for Spikevax and related bivalent vaccines represented a 30% decrease from the comparable period in 2021, while for the full year it represented only a 4% increase. Profit for the fourth quarter was $1.5bn, and for the full year it was $8.4bn, representing decreases of 70% and 31%, respectively.\n\nFor the full year of 2023, Moderna expects Spikevax to have sales contracted for delivery of $5bn.\n\nModerna's experience is analogous to those of other companies that have relied on pandemic windfalls. In its fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings, Gilead reported a 26.3% decline in sales of its antiviral Veklury (remdesivir) owing to lower rates of infection and hospitalization. (Also see \"Gilead CAR-T Joins Billion-Dollar Club As Biktarvy Sales Cross $10bn Mark\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.) Pfizer also said in its earnings that it expects sales of Comirnaty, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine it markets with BioNTech SE, to decline along with those of its antiviral treatment Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir). (Also see \"From Hallelujah To Headwind: Pfizer's COVID-19 Franchise Hits The Downturn\" - Scrip, 31 Jan, 2023.) Merck issued a similar forecast for its COVID-19 drug, Lagevrio (molnupiravir). (Also see \"Merck & Co. Remains 'Very Confident' In TIGIT\" - Scrip, 2 Feb, 2023.)\n\nCompany's Post-Pandemic Future Starts To Take Shape\n\nEarly on, Moderna moved to invest its revenues in pumping up its R&D, and while Bancel pointed to the dozens of programs it now has across a wide variety of disease states, the earnings report showed a diversified commercial-stage biotech company taking shape.\n\nIts likely first commercial product after its COVID-19 vaccines will be another vaccine against another respiratory infection, mRNA-1345 for RSV in older adults, for which Moderna plans regulatory filings in the first half of 2023.\n\n\"The topline results we've seen are incredibly encouraging, and we're grateful to the [US Food and Drug Administration] for [breakthrough therapy designation] for mRNA-1345, which further emphasizes the significant health impact of RSV in older adults and the high unmet need,\" Moderna president Stephen Hoge told the 23 February call.\n\nPhase III results announced in January for mRNA-1345 showed that the vaccine had 83.7% efficacy against RSV lower respiratory tract disease, indicating a rate of efficacy slightly higher than the 82.6% efficacy of GSK plc's vaccine and significantly more than the 66.7% of Pfizer's competitor. However, those were only topline data that make direct comparisons challenging. (Also see \"Phase III Results Show Moderna Could Challenge In Blockbuster RSV Vaccine Market\" - Scrip, 18 Jan, 2023.)\n\nModerna expects a Phase III interim efficacy analysis for mRNA-1010, its flu vaccine, to undergo data safety monitoring board review before the end of the first quarter.\n\nBut the company is making progress outside of respiratory infections as well, particularly in oncology.\n\nOn 22 February, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to mRNA-4157/V940, the mRNA cancer vaccine that Moderna is developing for melanoma under partnership with Merck and combining with the PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in the Phase IIb KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 trial. Data from the trial announced in December showing a 44% lower risk of recurrence or death for combination compared with Keytruda alone led to the breakthrough designation. (Also see \"Moderna Chalks Up Industry Milestone With mRNA Cancer Vaccine Efficacy Success\" - Scrip, 14 Dec, 2022.)\n\nHoge noted on the call that it was the first demonstration of efficacy for an investigational mRNA-based cancer treatment in a randomized trial, and Moderna and Merck plan to start \"multiple late-stage confirmatory studies\" in 2023, starting in melanoma and then moving to non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n\"We are planning to explore additional indications for 4157, where we believe there's a strong biologic rationale for immune-stimulating approaches,\" he said. \"These include early-stage and metastatic settings and will include indications where Keytruda is not yet approved.\"\nSummary: The company stated a fourth quarter downturn in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine sales and guided for sales of $5bn in 2023.
