Let's start from the beginning, everyone.\nAdam: What was the problem that time?\nJonathan: The feeling was all wrong, Mike. She is telling you that she doesn't want to see you any more, but I want to get more anger from you. You're acting hurt and sad, but that's not how your character would act in this situation.\nAdam: But Jason and Laura have been together for three years. Don't you think his reaction would be one of both anger and sadness?\nJonathan: At this point, no. I think he would react the way most guys would, and then later on, we would see his real feelings.\nAdam: I'm not so sure about that.\nJonathan: Let's try it my way, and you can see how you feel when you're saying your lines. After that, if it still doesn't feel right, we can try something else.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "Adam and Jonathan are discussing how to act out a certain scene.
