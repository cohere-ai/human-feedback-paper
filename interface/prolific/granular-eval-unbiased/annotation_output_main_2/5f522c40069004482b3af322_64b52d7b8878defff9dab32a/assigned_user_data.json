{"69": {"id": "69", "text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make raspberry muffins?", "Response A": "Sure, I can help you with that!  You will need the following ingredients:  1 cup of all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 cup melted butter, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.  You will also need a 9-cup baking pan.  First, preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  Then, in a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Then, in a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, eggs, milk, and vanilla extract.  Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.  Pour the batter into the 9-cup baking pan and spread it into an even layer.  Bake the muffins for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.  Let the muffins cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.  Once the muffins are completely cooled, you can store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.  Enjoy!", "Response B": "Sure! To make raspberry muffins, you\u2019ll want to start with a basic muffin batter. You can either make your own from scratch, or you can use a mix. Mix together flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, and butter, and add eggs, milk, and raspberries. Bake in a muffin tin at 400\u00b0F for 15 to 20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 41}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to make raspberry muffins?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure, I can help you with that!
