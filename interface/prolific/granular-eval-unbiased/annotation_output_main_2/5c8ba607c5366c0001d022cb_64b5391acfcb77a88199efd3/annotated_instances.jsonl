Don\u2019t be afraid to share your story.\n10. Don\u2019t be afraid to say no.", "Response B": "Sure, you can just type in a few words or phrases about the product you bought, or about the service you received.  You can also include a photo of the item if you\u2019d like.  You can also write a longer review if you\u2019d like, but it\u2019s not required.  I recommend you include some information about the product you bought, and also about the service you received.  You can also write about the quality of the product, and whether or not you\u2019d recommend it to others.  You can also write about the customer service you received, whether it was helpful or not.  You can also write about the overall experience you had with the shop, whether it was good or bad."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 36}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5c8ba607c5366c0001d022cb_64b5391acfcb77a88199efd3", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "4", "feedback": "I prefer the listed points for direction in response but appreciate the detailed response also"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 6s "}}
