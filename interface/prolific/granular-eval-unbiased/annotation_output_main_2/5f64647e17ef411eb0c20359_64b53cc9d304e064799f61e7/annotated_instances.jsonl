You\u2019ll want the water to be deep enough that you can submerge your underarms, and you\u2019ll also want to make sure the water isn\u2019t so deep that you\u2019ll be uncomfortable balancing it on your lap.\n\nOnce you have the water prepared, you\u2019ll want to sit on the edge of the bathtub or on a chair with your knees bent, and you\u2019ll want to lean forward so that your bottom is off the edge of the bathtub or the chair, and your thighs are parallel to the floor.
