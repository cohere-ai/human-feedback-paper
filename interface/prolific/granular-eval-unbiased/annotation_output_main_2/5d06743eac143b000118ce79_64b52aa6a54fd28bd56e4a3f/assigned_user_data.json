First, you\u2019ll want to find a good costume, and you\u2019ll want to make sure it\u2019s the right size for you.  You\u2019ll also want to make sure you\u2019re wearing the right makeup, and that you\u2019re using the right props.

You\u2019ll want to start with a white shirt and black pants. Then you can use black and white fabric to make a cape with the logo on it. You\u2019ll also want to make a belt and a headband with the same logo. You can find a white mask with black lines drawn on it to complete the look."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 32}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to cosplay death the kid?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure, I can help you with that.
