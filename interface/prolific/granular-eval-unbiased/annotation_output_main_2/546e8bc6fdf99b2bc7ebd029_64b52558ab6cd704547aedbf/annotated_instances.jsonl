I\u2019m not sure I understand the full context, but I can try to answer it.  In general, it seems like you\u2019re looking for some advice about how to eat in a way that\u2019s considered polite.  Is that right?", "Response B": "Eating mannerly means eating in a polite and respectful way, using good table manners.  Here are some basic guidelines for eating mannerly:\n\n-Use your fork in your right hand, and your knife in your left hand.  Hold your fork loosely in your right hand, with your fingers slightly curved around the handle.  Hold your knife firmly in your left hand, with your thumb on top of the handle and your other fingers underneath.\n-Cut your food into small bites before putting it in your mouth.  Don\u2019t shovel large bites into your mouth.\n-Chew with your mouth closed.\n-Don\u2019t talk with your mouth full.\n-Put your utensils down on your plate, not on the table, when you are finished with them.\n-When you are finished eating, place your fork and knife together on the far right side of your plate, with the handles pointing inwards.  This indicates that you are finished eating and don\u2019t need your plate"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 35}, "label_annotations": {"email": "546e8bc6fdf99b2bc7ebd029_64b52558ab6cd704547aedbf", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "2", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 2s "}}
