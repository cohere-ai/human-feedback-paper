Driverless cars under development today track their surroundings using cameras, radar, GPS and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) devices that measure distances using pulses of light emitted individually. However, the Aeva prototype sends out a continuous wave of light, enabling a more precise and reliable view of the world around autonomous cars.
