{"id": "520", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make 'melt and pour' soap?", "Response A": "Sure.  It\u2019s a pretty simple process, but you should read through the following instructions carefully to make sure you do it right.  First, you\u2019ll need to measure out the amount of soap base you\u2019ll need for the quantity of soap you want to make.  You\u2019ll want to make sure you have enough soap base to fill the molds you\u2019ll use, plus a little extra to account for any spillage or mistakes.  You\u2019ll also want to make sure you have enough soap to make the amount of soap you want.  You can use either a kitchen scale or a digital scale to make sure you get the right amount.  Make sure you\u2019re using the right kind of soap base, too.  You want to use a clear, white soap base that\u2019s labeled as \u2018melt and pour\u2019, and you want to make sure it\u2019s the right consistency.  You\u2019ll want to make sure it\u2019s not too hard, but also not too soft.  You want it to be easy to pour, but not so", "Response B": "Sure, I can help you with that!  First, you\u2019ll need to get some soap base.  You can buy it from a soap store, or you can make it yourself.  Once you have the soap base, you\u2019ll need to mix it with some oils, like vegetable oil or coconut oil.  You can also add some color to the soap, like green or pink.  Once you have the soap base, you\u2019ll need to pour it into a soap mold.  You can buy soap molds from a soap store, or you can make your own soap molds from a variety of materials.  Once you have the soap mold, you\u2019ll need to pour the soap base into it.  You\u2019ll need to wait until the soap base is completely solid, then you can remove it from the soap mold.  Once you have the soap base, you\u2019ll need to cut it into bars, and you can then use it to make soap."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 29}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63f8a51d30e2b7501f33e8ce_64b532736d69ce782e2a9d84", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "3", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 44s "}}
