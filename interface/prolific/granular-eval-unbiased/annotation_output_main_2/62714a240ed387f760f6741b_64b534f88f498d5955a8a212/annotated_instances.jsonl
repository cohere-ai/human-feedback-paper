Involve your kids in meal planning and preparation. This can help them feel invested in the meal and more likely to try new foods.\n2. Offer a variety of healthy foods at mealtime, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.\n3. Make healthy food fun by cutting food into fun shapes or using dips to make them more appealing.\n4. Avoid using food as a reward or punishment. This can create negative associations with healthy foods.\n5. Be a role model and eat healthy foods yourself.
