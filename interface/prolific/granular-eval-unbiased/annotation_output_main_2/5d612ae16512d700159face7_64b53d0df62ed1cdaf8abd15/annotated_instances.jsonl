{"id": "181", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to write an etsy review?", "Response A": "Sure, let\u2019s talk about that. Etsy is a website for buying and selling handmade goods, and as part of its platform, it allows buyers to leave reviews about their experiences with individual sellers. These reviews are important, because they help both buyers and sellers. Buyers can use reviews to learn more about a seller and decide whether they want to buy from them, and sellers can use reviews to improve their products and their customer service. Reviews are written in a specific format, like this:\n\n\u201cThis was my first purchase from this seller, and I\u2019m very happy with it! The earrings arrived quickly and were beautifully packaged, and they are even more lovely in person than in the pictures. They are a perfect gift, and I can\u2019t wait to give them to my friend! I would definitely buy from this seller again.\u201d", "Response B": "To write an Etsy review, simply go to the item you purchased and scroll down to the \u2018Write a Review\u2019 button. You can then rate the item and write a review of your experience. Make sure to be honest and specific in your review to help other buyers make informed decisions."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 36}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d612ae16512d700159face7_64b53d0df62ed1cdaf8abd15", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "5", "feedback": "Thank you!"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 13s "}}
