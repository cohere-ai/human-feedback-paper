The digital age has brought a range of new technologies into schools, and that has provided new opportunities for data collection and analysis. Schools are behind other sectors in embracing this potential, however.\n\nA recent report from public policy think tank the Center for Data Innovation urged federal and state policymakers to incentivize faster adoption in schools and districts. Beyond encouraging administrators to use data to improve their operations and instructional practices, the Center for Data Innovation wants schools to get data into the hands of students and parents, giving them more agency over the learning process.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The role of a K-12 chief information officer has evolved over time as ed tech and data analytics have become more prevalent in K-12 institutions. CIOs now spend less time on IT tasks and more time helping educators and administrators track and assess data to inform their decision-making. CIOs serve as data interpreters and visionaries, facilitating understanding between technology departments and academic/operational branches of their districts and developing a long-term plan about where data fits into the district's strategic goals. They also help educators without a data background gain insights from analytics and connect people from various departments with data to meet continuous improvement goals.", "Response B": "School and district leaders have had to adapt to the digital age, with the role of K-12 chief information officers (CIOs) shifting from IT-focused to data-driven. According to District Administration, CIOs now serve as data interpreters and visionaries, facilitating understanding between technology departments and academic/operational branches of their districts and developing a long-term plan about where data fits into the district's strategic goals.
