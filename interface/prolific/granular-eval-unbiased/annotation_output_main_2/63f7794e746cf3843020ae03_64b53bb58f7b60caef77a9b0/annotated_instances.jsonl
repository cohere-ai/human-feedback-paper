{"id": "221", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to avoid getting bunions?", "Response A": "It\u2019s hard to say.  The only way to prevent them is to never get them in the first place, and that\u2019s hard to do, since they\u2019re caused by genetic factors and external factors like shoes and walking.  One way to reduce your chances is to avoid high heels and other shoes that put pressure on your toes.  But if you\u2019re already getting them, the only way to get rid of them is to have surgery.  Do you have any other questions?", "Response B": "Sure, I can tell you that if you walk with your feet turned out and spread out, you\u2019re more likely to develop bunions.  If you walk with your feet turned in, you\u2019re less likely to develop bunions."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 24}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63f7794e746cf3843020ae03_64b53bb58f7b60caef77a9b0", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "2"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 12s "}}
