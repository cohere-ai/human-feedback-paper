The union says it represents 40,000 workers in the US.\n\nThe demonstration drew about 100 supporters and was organized by the union as well as the Massachusetts Jobs with Justice Coalition.\n\nIn a statement, Primark said it respects the right of its employees to organize, but that the decision on whether to join a union belongs to them.\n\nThe company also said it does not believe in \"top-down\" unionization, where a small number of union officials negotiate on behalf of employees.\n\nThe union says the majority of Primark's employees in Europe are members of unions.\n\nThe UFCW Local 1445's political director told the Globe in an earlier interview that the union plans to continue efforts to organize Primark workers and is hoping the retailer will eventually reach out to them.\n\nThe union has also launched a website, www.primarkworkers.org, to call attention to their cause.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, the union said: \"While Primark may claim it respects the rights of its employees to organize, the truth is that the company has refused to even meet with its employees to discuss the possibility.\"\n\nThe union said that with the exception of a few employees, Primark has not responded to any requests for meetings or discussions about unionization.", "Response B": "Over 100 union members and organizers demonstrated in Downtown Crossing to call attention to the fact that Primark, a low-cost fashion retailer that's opening its first US store there next month, has not agreed to meet with United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1445 about organizing its workers.
