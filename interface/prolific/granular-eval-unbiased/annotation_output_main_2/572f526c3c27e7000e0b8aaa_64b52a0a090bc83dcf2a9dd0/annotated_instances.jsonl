{"id": "794", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to eat mannerly?", "Response A": "Eating mannerly means eating in a polite and respectful way, using good table manners.  Here are some basic guidelines for eating mannerly:\n\n-Use your fork in your right hand, and your knife in your left hand.  Hold your fork loosely in your right hand, with your fingers slightly curved around the handle.  Hold your knife firmly in your left hand, with your thumb on top of the handle and your other fingers underneath.\n-Cut your food into small bites before putting it in your mouth.  Don\u2019t shovel large bites into your mouth.\n-Chew with your mouth closed.\n-Don\u2019t talk with your mouth full.\n-Put your utensils down on your plate, not on the table, when you are finished with them.\n-When you are finished eating, place your fork and knife together on the far right side of your plate, with the handles pointing inwards.  This indicates that you are finished eating and don\u2019t need your plate", "Response B": "Eating mannerly typically involves using proper table etiquette, such as using a napkin, sitting up straight at the table, avoiding talking with your mouth full, and using utensils properly. It's also important to not make loud noises while eating and to avoid reaching across the table to grab something. Additionally, it's important to not eat too quickly or too slowly and to avoid using your hands to eat certain foods."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 35}, "label_annotations": {"email": "572f526c3c27e7000e0b8aaa_64b52a0a090bc83dcf2a9dd0", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "5", "score_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 8s "}}
