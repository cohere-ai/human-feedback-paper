{"id": "687", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Dive Brief:\n\nPeter West, director of eLearning at Saint Stephen's College in Australia, writes for eSchool News that humans have 40,000 years of communicating with pen-like instruments and that students lose something when they move completely to writing with keyboards.\n\nResearch shows students who take lecture notes on a keyboard are more likely to transcribe content mindlessly, which leads to lower performance on factual recall as well as conceptual learning in short- and long-term tests \u2014 and even though students say they prefer keyboards, pens actually support their performance better.\n\nand even though students say they prefer keyboards, pens actually support their performance better. Additional research shows keyboards constrain subjects that use symbols, limit creativity and increase cognitive load, and West encourages teachers to consider using digital pen and paper to capitalize on the benefits of the writing implement as well as connected and collaborative technology.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMany have bemoaned the loss of handwriting among students. Many schools are no longer required to teach cursive. Perhaps the shift has been too complete with the advent of the computer. But technology companies aren't throwing away the commitment to pen and paper.\n\nIn its release of upgrades for the 2016-17 school year, Microsoft Classroom expanded the number of color options for its stylus in OneNote and added a math assistant that can identify whether students are solving a math problem correctly, as well as show what method would lead to a correct answer. Teachers now have the opportunity to revive handwriting without foregoing the digital world.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Writing with pen and paper has been the norm for thousands of years, but with the advent of computers, keyboarding has become the norm.  While it is faster to write with a keyboard, using a pen and paper allows for more creativity, and allows for better retention and understanding of the material.  Additionally, technology companies have not abandoned pen and paper, and have developed technology that allows the benefits of both pen and paper and digital technology.", "Response B": "Students are more likely to transcribe content mindlessly when taking lecture notes on a keyboard, according to research by the University of Manchester. The findings also revealed that keyboards limit creativity and increase cognitive load, and that students prefer keyboards to pens. Additional research showed that students who used keyboards for note taking performed worse in short-term and long-term tests. The report also found that students who rely on keyboards for note taking were less confident in their ability to recall information and were less able to understand the concepts they had learned.\n\nMicrosoft Classroom has announced that the 2016-17 school year will see the introduction of color options for its stylus in OneNote and the addition of a math assistant that can identify whether students are solving a math problem correctly.\n\nMicrosoft Classroom is a cloud-based teaching and learning platform that is designed to help teachers manage their entire classroom with the help of the platform's digital ink and pen technology.\n\nMicrosoft Classroom provides teachers with a variety of tools that enable them to create digital ink-based tasks, which students can then complete and submit.\n\nMicrosoft Classroom offers a range of tools that enable teachers to create digital ink-based tasks for students, which students can then complete and submit."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "main_batch_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "sample_ix": 30}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5f6e2f793c9b1032dbe72def_64b52d9b0beafb97d914fb3b", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "score_a": "4", "score_b": "2"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 10s "}}
