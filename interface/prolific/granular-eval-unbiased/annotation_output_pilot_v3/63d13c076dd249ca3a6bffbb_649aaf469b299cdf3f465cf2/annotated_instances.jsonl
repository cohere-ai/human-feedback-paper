{"id": "14", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Conversation:\nSimon: You're finally here! What took so long?\nTerence: I got stuck in traffic again. There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection.\nSimon: It's always rather congested down there during rush hour. Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home.\nTerence: I don't think it can be avoided, to be honest.\nSimon: perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work.\nTerence: I think it's something that I'll have to consider. The public transport system is pretty good.\nSimon: It would be better for the environment, too.\nTerence: I know. I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city.\nSimon: Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well.\nTerence: The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car.\nSimon: Well, when it's nicer outside, you can start biking to work. That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides.\nTerence: That's true. I could certainly use the exercise!\nSimon: So, are you going to quit driving to work then?\nTerence: Yes, it's not good for me or for the environment.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "The conversation is about traffic jams and finding alternative ways to commute.
