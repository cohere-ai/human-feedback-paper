Start by drawing a circle for the head and a slightly larger circle for the body.\n2. Add two smaller circles for the ears and a longer oval for the neck.\n3. Draw two lines for the back and two more for the front legs, making sure they are bent at the knees.\n4. Add a curved line for the belly and another for the tail.\n5. Details can be added such as eyes, nostrils, and mouth.\n6.
