But a nonstop flight on Royal Jordanian from Amman - 100 miles east of Tel Aviv - takes eight hours 10 minutes. In fact, flying Tel Aviv to Amman, and then on to Bangkok can be quicker, even including transfer time at the airport - a connecting flight can take as little as nine hours 55 minutes on Royal Jordanian.\n\nWhen the airline was banned from Saudi airspace, El Al flights from Tel Aviv to Mumbai took seven hours 45 minutes.
