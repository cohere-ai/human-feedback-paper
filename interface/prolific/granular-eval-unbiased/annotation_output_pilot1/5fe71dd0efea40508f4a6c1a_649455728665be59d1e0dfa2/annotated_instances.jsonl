Are you ready?\nBarbara: Yes, sir. Go ahead.\nCharles: Attention all staff... Effective immediately, all office communications are restricted to email correspondence and official memos. The use of Instant Message programs by employees during working hours is strictly prohibited.\nBarbara: Sir, does this apply to intra-office communications only? Or will it also restrict external communications?\nCharles: It should apply to all communications, not only in this office between employees, but also any outside communications.\nBarbara: But sir, many employees use Instant Messaging to communicate with their clients.\nCharles: They will just have to change their communication methods. I don't want any - one using Instant Messaging in this office. It wastes too much time! Now, please continue with the memo. Where were we?\nBarbara: This applies to internal and external communications.\nCharles: Yes. Any employee who persists in using Instant Messaging will first receive a warning and be placed on probation. At second offense, the employee will face termination. Any questions regarding this new policy may be directed to department heads.\nBarbara: Is that all?\nCharles: Yes. Please get this memo typed up and distributed to all employees before 4 pm.\n\nNow write a summary of the conversation:", "Response A": "Charles, the boss, informs Barbara that Instant Messaging programs are prohibited during office hours for employees, and any employee who uses them will be warned and potentially fired.
