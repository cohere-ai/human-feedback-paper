{"id": "42", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to write a commit message?", "Response A": "Sure! A commit message is simply a short description of the changes made in the most recent commit. It is important to include a commit message because it allows others (and yourself) to understand the changes made.\n\nHere are some tips for writing a good commit message:\n\n1. Keep it short and concise. A commit message should be no longer than a few sentences.\n2. Use active voice. This will make the message more clear and easier to understand.\n3. Use bullet points or short sentences. This will make the message easier to read.\n4. Use a consistent format. This will make it easier to read the message.\n5. Use a descriptive title. This will make it easier to find the message in the future.", "Response B": "A commit message should be a concise and informative summary of the changes made in the commit. It should clearly describe the purpose of the changes and why they were made. It is important to use proper grammar and to avoid using all caps or excessive punctuation. The commit message should also reference any relevant issues or pull requests associated with the changes. Finally, it is recommended to follow a specific format or template to ensure consistency across the project."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "pilot_batch_v2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 0}, "label_annotations": {"score_a": {"scale_5": "5"}, "score_b": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 19s "}}
