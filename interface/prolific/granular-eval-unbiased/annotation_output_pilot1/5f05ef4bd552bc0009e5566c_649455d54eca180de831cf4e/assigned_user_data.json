A commit message is simply a short description of the changes made in the most recent commit.

Keep it short and concise. A commit message should be no longer than a few sentences.\n2. Use active voice. This will make the message more clear and easier to understand.\n3. Use bullet points or short sentences. This will make the message easier to read.\n4. Use a consistent format. This will make it easier to read the message.\n5. Use a descriptive title.

It should clearly describe the purpose of the changes and why they were made. It is important to use proper grammar and to avoid using all caps or excessive punctuation.
