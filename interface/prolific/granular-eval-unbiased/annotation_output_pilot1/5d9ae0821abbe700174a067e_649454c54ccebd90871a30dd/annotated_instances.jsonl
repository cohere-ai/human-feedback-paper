A commit message is simply a short description of the changes made in the most recent commit. It is important to include a commit message because it allows others (and yourself) to understand the changes made.\n\nHere are some tips for writing a good commit message:\n\n1. Keep it short and concise. A commit message should be no longer than a few sentences.\n2. Use active voice. This will make the message more clear and easier to understand.\n3. Use bullet points or short sentences. This will make the message easier to read.\n4. Use a consistent format. This will make it easier to read the message.\n5. Use a descriptive title. This will make it easier to find the message in the future.", "Response B": "Provide a broad subject statement describing the changes.\nAdd a body to the commit message.\nInclude a procedure for testing your change, if possible.\nList\u00a0any caveats to the change you made.\nSquash minor changes together."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "pilot_batch_v2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 0}, "label_annotations": {"score_a": {"scale_5": "5"}, "score_b": {"scale_3": "3"}, "feedback": {"text_box": "None "}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 22s "}}
