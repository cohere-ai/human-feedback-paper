{"id": "38", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Cal State Los Angeles was awarded a $16.6 million grant Tuesday from the California Department of Health Care Services to promote dental health among low-income children and young adults.\n\nThe university was one of 15 recipients of Local Dental Pilot Project funding, which is part of the Medi-Cal 2020 Dental Transformation Initiative that aims to help those enrolled in Denti-Cal, which provides dental services under Medi-Cal to about 6 million children in California.\n\n\"This grant recognizes our long history of service and engagement in underserved communities,\" Cal State L.A. President William A. Covino said. \"With this grant, we will be able to assist children who desperately need dental care. We're grateful for the opportunity to serve in new ways.\"\n\nThe four-year grant is believed to be the largest in the university's history.\n\n\"Oral health is directly connected with overall health status and well-being across the lifespan,\" said CSULA professor Rita Ledesma, who is a principal investigator on the grant.\n\n\"Oral health can affect academic achievement, self-esteem, relationships, income and quality of life,'' she said. \"The grant provides a unique opportunity to build partnerships with community-based organizations and deliver oral health screening, oral health education and supplemental services to address dental health disparities that children and families experience in our community.\"\n\nCSULA officials said the project will implement educational and intervention strategies for children and young adults in the Los Angeles region and include health screenings. It will also focus on continuity of care and interdisciplinary training of students, agency staff and community members.\n\nThe project will also develop outreach to families who have children with special needs, and American Indian and Alaska native families. CSULA will team with USC and Children's Hospital Los Angeles as partners in reaching out to families with children with special needs.\n\n\"We look forward to joining with USC to carry out this important work,\" said Jose A. Gomez, Cal State L.A.'s executive vice president. \"The knowledge and expertise of our two institutions will serve Los Angeles well.\"\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Cal State Los Angeles was awarded a $16.6 million grant Tuesday from the California Department of Health Care Services to promote dental health among low-income children and young adults.", "Response B": "Doctors at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital claim to have cured two infants with aggressive and previously incurable forms of leukaemia, according to reports in journal Science Translational Medicine. The treatment involved isolating healthy immune T-cells in donors and deactivating the T-cell genes that would normally cause them to be rejected once transplanted. The technique makes use of a genetic engineering tool known as TALENs, which designed the T-cells to attack cancer cells directly. While the use of engineered T-cells has previously been successful in treating blood cancers, using donated cells offers the potential for a cheaper, faster cure."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "pilot_batch_v2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "refs", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_0"}, "label_annotations": {"score_a": {"scale_5": "5"}, "score_b": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 18s "}}
