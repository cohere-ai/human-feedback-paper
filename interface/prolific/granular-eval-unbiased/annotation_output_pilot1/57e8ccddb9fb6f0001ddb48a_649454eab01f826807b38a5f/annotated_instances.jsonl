{"id": "45", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to write a commit message?", "Response A": "Sure! A commit message is a message that you can include in a commit when you are saving a file. It is a way to describe what you have done and why you have done it.\n\nHere are some tips for writing a good commit message:\n\n- Keep it short and sweet. No more than 50 characters.\n- Be descriptive. What have you done?\n- Make it easy to understand. Use descriptive words that make sense to you and others who read your code.\n- Keep it consistent. Use the same format every time you write a commit message.\n- Be careful not to make your commit message too long. It should be no more than 100 characters.\n- Keep it focused. Make sure your commit message is about one specific thing.\n- Don't forget to add a comment. This will help you and others understand what you have done.", "Response B": "A commit message should be a concise and informative summary of the changes made in the commit. It should clearly describe the purpose of the changes and why they were made. It is important to use proper grammar and to avoid using all caps or excessive punctuation. The commit message should also reference any relevant issues or pull requests associated with the changes. Finally, it is recommended to follow a specific format or template to ensure consistency across the project."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "pilot_batch_v2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 0}, "label_annotations": {"score_a": {"scale_5": "5"}, "score_b": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 52s "}}
