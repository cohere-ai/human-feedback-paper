It is a way to describe what you have done and why you have done it.\n\nHere are some tips for writing a good commit message:\n\n- Keep it short and sweet. No more than 50 characters.\n- Be descriptive. What have you done?\n- Make it easy to understand. Use descriptive words that make sense to you and others who read your code.\n- Keep it consistent. Use the same format every time you write a commit message.\n- Be careful not to make your commit message too long. It should be no more than 100 characters.\n- Keep it focused. Make sure your commit message is about one specific thing.\n- Don't forget to add a comment. This will help you and others understand what you have done.", "Response B": "Provide a broad subject statement describing the changes.\nAdd a body to the commit message.\nInclude a procedure for testing your change, if possible.\nList\u00a0any caveats to the change you made.\nSquash minor changes together."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "pilot_batch_v2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6B_v14_20230622", "model_b": "refs", "sample_ix": 0}, "label_annotations": {"score_a": {"scale_5": "5"}, "score_b": {"scale_3": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 10s "}}
