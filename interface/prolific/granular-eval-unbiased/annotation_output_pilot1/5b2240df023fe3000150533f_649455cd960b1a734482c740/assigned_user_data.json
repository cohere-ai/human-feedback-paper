A commit message is a message that you can include in a commit when you are saving a file.

No more than 50 characters.\n- Be descriptive. What have you done?\n- Make it easy to understand. Use descriptive words that make sense to you and others who read your code.\n- Keep it consistent. Use the same format every time you write a commit message.\n- Be careful not to make your commit message too long. It should be no more than 100 characters.\n- Keep it focused. Make sure your commit message is about one specific thing.\n- Don't forget to add a comment.
