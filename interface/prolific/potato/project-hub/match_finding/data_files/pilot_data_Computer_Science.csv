This indicates that when the flights encounter departure delays, the implementation of one checked bag fees reduces SpAdj-Departure-Delay by 1.8701 minutes (when a delay occurs) versus no implementation of these fees. In other words, the airlines that implemented the fee for one checked bag saw their departure performance improve, whereas Southwest Airlines experienced a negative impact on its departure performance.","So, a drop in total baggage volume benefits not only the airlines that charge baggage fees but also those that do not. Southwest's improved departure time performance was not as significant as its rival airlines, which did charge for checked bags, and it appears to have hurt one of Southwest's historical competitive advantages in customer service. Southwest's ""bags fly free"" policy is likely not free based on lost opportunity cost, mostly because it could be offering more flights per day with increased boarding times due to charging for checked bags.","This indicates that when the flights encounter departure delays, the implementation of one checked bag fees reduces SpAdj-Departure-Delay by 1.8701 minutes (when a delay occurs) versus no implementation of these fees.","Southwest's improved departure time performance was not as significant as its rival airlines, which did charge for checked bags, and it appears to have hurt one of Southwest's historical competitive advantages in customer service.",,0.8757984638214111,"{'News': '<span data-toggle=""tooltip"" data-html=""true"" data-placement=""bottom"" title=""Context: So, a drop in total baggage volume benefits not only the airlines that charge baggage fees but also those that do not.
