"Dear Rick, 

I wanted to let you know that we have not pursued this aspect from South America because we are unsure if it will bring any competitive sourcing in the future. This venture would take a few years to develop if we get it launched. Other companies don't seem to want to remain dependent on oil exclusively from South America. We will continue to keep our eyes on the situation and plan what to do moving forward.

I hope this email finds you well. It's great to hear from you. However, I must apologize for my previous message's language and tone. Looking back, I realize that it was impolite and unprofessional, and I regret any offense that I may have caused.
I am currently experiencing some physical and mental challenges that have affected my ability to invest adequately. I have been considering alternative options for securing my finances, such as burying my money in a secure location. Additionally, I have been contemplating purchasing a new car or a property, but my low utility bill of only $20.00 has given me pause.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to discuss the current state of Enron and its potential impact on our work. It appears that the company is facing some challenges, with the stock prices continuing to decline and a significant note due soon. As such, there may be some concerns about the availability of collateral.

With that in mind, I would like to suggest that we explore all options to ensure that our work remains unaffected, including the possibility of Joe returning to work if needed. If things become more challenging, we could also consider the option of moving back to Omaha and living in a trailer by AKSARBEN.

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base with you regarding the recent performance of the stock market.

I believe that this downturn may be due to a number of factors, including margin positions being squeezed out of tech stocks.

In particular, I would recommend looking into CSCO, LU, MSFT, and ENE, as they all look very promising.

"Hello,

I am pleased to inform you that I have completed the June 6 trading positions and will now proceed to set up the economics page, which I anticipate will not take much time.

I would appreciate your guidance regarding reversals from our currency book. Specifically, which direction should the reversals from the other books go?

Regarding the cash deals, I must mention that they are not all in the model for the June 1 - June 6 period, as the physical position is unbalanced. However, I plan to discuss this matter with Mike to find a suitable solution.

Overall, I am optimistic about the progress we have made so far and can see a light at the end of the tunnel. I hope this update will make things easier for you.

Lastly, I want to express my gratitude for your support throughout this process. Thank you for your hard work!

"Hello Karen.
I received your question about severance pay in the event of employment termination. For your records, I'll repeat your question below:
""Will I still receive severance if the company files bankruptcy?""
To answer your question, it is unfortunately unlikely that severance payments would continue in the event of bankruptcy of the company. The general policy is that current or former employees of a bankrupt entity are considered as unsecured creditors, in line with other unsecured creditors. Due to this, employee claims will generally be represented through a court designated trustee. Please let me know if this answers your question, or if you need further information.

"Dear Lynn,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to update you on the latest developments regarding our home office setup.

I'm pleased to share that we have updated our Remedy system to prioritize support for our home office workers. Additionally, we have made it a priority to assign any requests to Glenn or Robert whenever possible. Speaking of which, I'm happy to report that Glenn was able to successfully install a modem in Shirley's machine.

However, we are still experiencing some issues with the CITRIX Server and VPN access. Our solution center team believes that the problem may be on the Road Runner side, and Jean McFarland is currently working on a resolution. Despite this challenge, I am glad to report that everyone has been able to work from home with little to no issues.

Thank you for your understanding and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

In case it's helpful, I suggest looking into relative storage levels and price levels for all BTUs in 1998.

It might also be useful to compare the two graphs and examine any differences.
