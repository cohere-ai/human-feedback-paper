Luckily, Greyhound bus trips are pretty cheap, so I can take a 10 hour bus ride on the weekends every month or so to see her.\n\nI guess it was too much for her. She found another guy who could be with her 24/7. All of her friends blocked me. She doesn't want to see me until I \"calm down.\"\n\nI'm back home... alone... celebrating New Years alone again.

I've been in your spot before, and it's one of the worst things ever. I actually seriously tried offing myself years back by partial hanging after the better part of a year of barely leaving my bed (I literally only left for food and bathroom needs). It's completely soul crushing what your mind can do to itself. I'll tell you this though - as I was hanging there, after about 20 minutes of not passing out (which should have taken seconds), I came to a realization - if I'm trying this hard to end myself, why not just put that effort into life? The worst that could happen is failure and death, which is what I was just going for anyway, so why not hang on and see what else life has in store for me? So I hung on.\n\nA while later, I got married, and had a kid (and a stepdaughter). Being a providing father was my life, and working for my family really gave me purpose. I eventually couldn't handle the job anymore and went back on disability. We struggled, but were mostly happy and loving. Then, a little over a year ago, I found my 2 year old daughter dead in her crib. SIDS. Worst fucking thing imaginable, even counting years of horrors I've been through. We did what we could to move forward, but the previous financial strain and the loss of purpose was just too much.\n\nMy wife left me in April. You'd think this is where it gets darker. But no, I refuse to let depression have that strong of a hold on me again. I found a better job, and quickly became store manager. I got my own place again. My purpose in life now? Improving myself. I've been working on myself my whole life, but now I'm going it alone, adamant to retain happiness, myself, for myself. It's not easy, and I do sometimes go back to that dark place, but I refuse to backside too far.\n\nMy point here? Just keep pushing, and never stop, no matter how much life fucks with you. You are worthy of love and respect, don't let your sickness tell you different. You are not alone, and while I know you probably don't feel strong right now, I know you have it in you. Don't give up on yourself, and do the best you can with what you got. And please, message me if you ever need to talk.\n\nHope you have a happy new year. Welcome in the new year with a determined, positive new mindset, and never give up! You have more inner strength than you realize, and you owe it to yourself to utilize it. Best wishes!", "annotations": []}
