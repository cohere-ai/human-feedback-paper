{"id": "781", "input_text": {"Prompt": "By bringing artificial intelligence to its wearable tech, PIQ is looking to improve on its design. Whether you are playing golf, tennis, skiing, or kiteboarding, this new technology will help you get better in any sport\n\nUntil now, sports wearables have largely boiled down to high-tech sensors recording basic data. With the addition of GAIA Intelligence, the company will be able to make the PIQ Robot that much better at improving your performance.\n\nBoth the PIQ Robot and GAIA Intelligence give coaches and athletes the ability to analyze every movement during a game or match. This data can then be compared with any previous performances as well as with a community's performance overall. The system will highlight key improvements to focus on for success.\n\nThe French startup has one of the most powerful wearable sensors on the market. The PIQ Robot captures and analyzes more than thousands of data points to measure speed, strength, and precision.\n\nTo better understand and analyze sports movements, GAIA was developed. Using various motion-capture algorithms, the software is able to break down body movement related to a specific sport. GAIA will continue to learn from your movement each time you use the PIQ Robot. To give the artificial intelligence a head start, GAIA has been analyzing millions of movements from thousands of other athletes.\n\n\"With GAIA and the Winning Factors, sports wearables enter a new paradigm,\"CEO C\u00e9dric Mangaud said in a statement. \"Our technology enables athletes, not only to measure their performance but also to benefit from personalized advice and get closer to victory. Our goal is now to integrate this technology in sports devices to offer athletes a fully integrated experience.\"\n\nIf you already own a PIQ Robot, don't worry about ordering a new one. A free software update will bring GAIA to all current users. PIQ wants to make sure that everyone has the ability to improve their performance.\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The PIQ Robot is a wearable sensor that captures and analyzes data about body movement in sports, and the GAIA Intelligence software uses various motion-capture algorithms to evaluate this data.  The software is able to break down body movement related to a specific sport, and will continue to learn from the movement of the user each time they use the PIQ Robot.  The goal of integrating the GAIA Intelligence software with the PIQ Robot is to enable athletes to benefit from personalized advice that will help them improve their performance.", "Response B": "India and Venezuela are not the only countries that have been demonetizing their currencies or seeing their citizens turn to Bitcoin as a result.  Many other nations, including China, Zimbabwe, Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Italy, Great Britain and Ukraine have also seen their currencies devalued or have had cash bans imposed by their national banking systems.  The growing list of countries that have demonetized their currencies or seen their citizens turn to Bitcoin as a result strengthens the global demand and value for Bitcoin."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_139", "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5cca199061e0b90017809cb7_64e624f0c4a95ace0d78a121", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "3", "complexity_b": "2", "assertive_a": "5", "assertive_b": "2"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 1s "}}
