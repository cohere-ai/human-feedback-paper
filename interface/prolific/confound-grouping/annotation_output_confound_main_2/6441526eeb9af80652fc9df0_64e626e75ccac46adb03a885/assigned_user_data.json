Start with a good photo of the dog. This will help you to capture the dog's personality and features accurately.\n\n2. Use a reference photo to help you with the proportions of the dog's face. This will ensure that the dog's features are accurate and proportional.\n\n3. Use a variety of brushstrokes and colors to create a sense of depth and texture in the painting. This will help to bring the dog's features to life.\n\n4. Use a light touch when painting the dog's fur. This will help to create a sense of softness and fluffiness.\n\n5. Be sure to capture the dog's personality in the painting. This can be done through the use of facial expressions and body language.\n\n6. Have fun! Painting a portrait of a dog should be a enjoyable experience. Don't be too hard on yourself if the painting doesn't turn out exactly as you had hoped.", "Response B": "Sure, I can give you some pointers.  First, you\u2019ll need to choose the dog you want to paint, and take some photos of it.  Then you\u2019ll need to get some paints and paintbrushes, and some paper to paint on.  You can use acrylic paint, since it\u2019s easy to work with and it dries quickly.  You\u2019ll also need a palette to mix the paint on, and some water.  Then you\u2019ll want to draw a sketch of the dog on the paper, using charcoal or a pencil."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 126, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to paint a portrait of a dog?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure!
