To prevent injury, it is recommended to turn off the power and allow the bulb to cool down before attempting to clean it. Once the bulb has cooled down, use a soft cloth or paper towel to gently wipe the bulb and remove any dust or debris. Avoid using water or harsh chemicals, as these can damage the bulb. If the bulb is coated in a film, you can try using a mixture of equal parts water and white vinegar to gently wipe it away.
