It can be really hard to deal with backstabbers, but just try to focus on your own positive qualities and actions, and don\u2019t let these people get to you.  And if you do find yourself getting upset or angry in response to their behavior, try to let it go and just move on.", "Response B": "Themes are design layouts for the tumblr blog publishing platform.
