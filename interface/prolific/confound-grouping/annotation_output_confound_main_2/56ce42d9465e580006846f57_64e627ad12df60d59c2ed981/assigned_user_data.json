Here are some tips to consider:\n\n- Dress in layers: Wear multiple layers of clothing to trap heat and protect against the cold. Start with a base layer of moisture-wicking fabric, followed by a middle layer of insulating material, and finish with an outer layer that is windproof and water-resistant.\n- Protect your extremities: Wear gloves, a hat, and a scarf to cover your hands, head, and face. These areas are particularly vulnerable to the cold and can quickly become uncomfortable or even dangerous if not properly protected.\n- Warm up properly: Before heading out for your jog, take some time to warm up indoors. This will help increase your body temperature and prepare your muscles for the cold weather.\n- Be aware of your surroundings: Pay attention to the weather conditions and adjust your pace and distance accordingly. If it is particularly cold or windy, consider cutting your jog short or reducing the intensity.\n- Monitor your body temperature: Keep an eye on your body temperature and adjust your clothing as needed. If you start to feel too hot, remove a layer of clothing. If you start to feel too cold, add a layer of clothing.\n- Stay hydrated: It is important to stay hydrated, even in cold weather. Make sure to drink plenty of water before and after your jog.\n- Monitor your heart rate: Cold weather can increase your heart rate, so it is important to monitor it and not push yourself too hard. If your heart rate is too high, slow down and take a break.\n- Be aware of signs of hypothermia: Hypothermia is a medical condition that occurs when the body's core temperature drops below normal. Symptoms include shivering, confusion, drowsiness, and loss of coordination. If you experience any of these symptoms, stop jogging and seek medical attention."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 127, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to jog in cold weather?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Ooh, jogging in cold weather?
