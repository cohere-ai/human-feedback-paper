{"id": "408", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make sloe gin?", "Response A": "Certainly! Here's a recipe for making sloe gin:\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 lb (450 g) sloes\n- 1 bottle gin\n- 1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar\n\nInstructions:\n1. Wash the sloes and remove any stems.\n2. Put the sloes and sugar in a large glass jar or ceramic container.\n3. Pour in the bottle of gin and stir until the sugar dissolves.\n4. Cover the jar with a tight-fitting lid and store it in a cool, dark place for 3 months, shaking it occasionally to help the flavors meld together.\n5. Strain the gin through a fine-mesh sieve and discard the sloes.\n6. Pour the gin back into the original bottle, or into a clean, sterilized bottle.\n7. Serve chilled.\n\nNote: The longer you let the sloe gin sit, the more complex the flavors will become. You can also add additional ingredients such as orange peel or cinnamon sticks to add depth of flavor. Enjoy!", "Response B": "Hmm. I\u2019ve never made it before, so let me look online. It looks like there are a few different recipes. The first one I found suggests putting the sloe berries in a jar with some sugar and leaving it for a few weeks."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 125, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6129ba3532102d5c539ff29b_64e62c00868af3022efa9edc", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "3", "complexity_b": "1", "assertive_a": "3", "assertive_b": "1"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 7s "}}
