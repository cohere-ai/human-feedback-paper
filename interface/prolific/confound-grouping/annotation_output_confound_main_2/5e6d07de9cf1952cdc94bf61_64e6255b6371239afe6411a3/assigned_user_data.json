Wear cozy clothes like a hat, scarf, and warm socks.\n2. Start slow. Don't run too fast, or you might get too cold.\n3. Keep moving. Jog, jog, jog! Don't stop too long or you'll get chilly.\n4. Stay safe. Watch out for icy patches and slippery streets.\n5. Have fun! Sing a happy song or listen to your favorite tunes to keep you going.\n\nRemember, it's important to be careful when you're out in the cold. Stay warm, stay safe, and have a great time jogging!", "Response B": "Sure! When jogging in cold weather, it's important to dress warmly. Wear layers, such as a base layer, a second layer, and a third layer. The base layer should be made of a material that wicks away sweat, while the second and third layers should be made of warm, insulating materials. It's also important to protect your head, hands, and feet, as these areas are prone to getting cold. Use gloves, a hat, and warm socks. Finally, be sure to warm up before you start jogging and cool down after you finish. This will prevent muscle strain and injuries."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 127, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to jog in cold weather?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Ooh, jogging in cold weather?
