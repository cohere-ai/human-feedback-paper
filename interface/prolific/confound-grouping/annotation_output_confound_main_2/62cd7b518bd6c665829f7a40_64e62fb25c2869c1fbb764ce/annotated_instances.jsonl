{"id": "201", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to get eyebrow microblading?", "Response A": "To get eyebrow microblading, you should research and find a reputable professional in your area. They will typically have a consultation with you to discuss your goals and expectations for the procedure. Once you are comfortable with the plan, the professional will use a handheld tool to create tiny cuts in your skin and deposit ink. After the initial session, you will need touch-ups every few months to maintain the results.", "Response B": "Sure! Microblading is a form of tattooing that involves creating small, hairlike marks on the skin. It\u2019s a fairly new technique, but it\u2019s gaining popularity because it looks very natural. If you\u2019re interested in getting microblading, you\u2019ll need to find a professional tattoo artist who is experienced with this technique. You can search online or ask for recommendations. After you find a few candidates, you should schedule consultations with them to see if they\u2019re a good fit. Then you can make your decision and get the procedure done. I hope that helps! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 130, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "62cd7b518bd6c665829f7a40_64e62fb25c2869c1fbb764ce", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "3", "complexity_b": "3", "assertive_a": "4", "assertive_b": "4", "feedback": "B was better"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 34s "}}
