A very simple technique is to simply hold the book or device in one hand and swing the arm holding the item in a pendulum-like fashion as you take steps.  In this way the item will oscillate back and forth in a controlled fashion, and you can alternate your gaze between the text and the area in front of you to avoid tripping hazards.  Another approach is to use a device that clips onto your eyeglasses, and which has a small screen and light source for displaying text.  The advantage of this approach is that the text will be projected right in front of you without the need to hold anything, but the disadvantage is that it may be more difficult to read in bright sunlight.  A third approach is to use a voice reader, which can read the text out loud to you at a comfortable volume level, so that you can listen to the text while walking.  This approach also has the advantage of not requiring you to hold anything, but the disadvantage is that it may be more difficult to read complex texts or ones with many figures or tables."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 139, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to read while walking?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Reading while walking can be challenging, but it is possible with practice and the right technique.
