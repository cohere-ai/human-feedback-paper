I think the single most important thing is to make sure there are plenty of non-alcoholic drinks available, and to make sure that alcohol is not served to anyone underage.  I also think it\u2019s important to provide food, and to encourage people to eat.  This can reduce the impact of alcohol, and also it\u2019s a good way to give people something to do besides drink.
