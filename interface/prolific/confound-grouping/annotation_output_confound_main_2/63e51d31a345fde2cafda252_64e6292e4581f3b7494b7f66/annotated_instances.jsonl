It's a great way to stay entertained and informed while you're on the go.\n\nTo read while walking, you'll need to find a comfortable spot to sit or stand, and bring a book or other reading material with you. You'll also need to be careful not to trip or fall, as you may be distracted by the book.\n\nOnce you've found a comfortable spot, you can start reading. It's a good idea to start with a short book or article, so you don't get too tired or bored.\n\nAs you read, you may want to take breaks every few minutes to stretch or walk around a bit. This will help you stay focused and avoid getting too tired.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 139, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63e51d31a345fde2cafda252_64e6292e4581f3b7494b7f66", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "2", "complexity_b": "2", "assertive_a": "1", "assertive_b": "5", "feedback": "Response A asks another question.
