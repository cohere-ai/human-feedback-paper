The ad is then targeted to people similar to those who have noticed it.\n\nWith an increasing number of people using mobiles, Facebook has teamed up with Millward Brown Digital so that advertisers can analyse the impact of their ads.\n\nEarlier this year, the site partnered with Nielsen so today's announcement means that brands can use either measurement for mobile polling.\n\nThis week will see Facebook introducing videos to its carousel platform too. It was launched last year to allow advertisers to add more images in one post which Facebook explained as an \"amazing storytelling tool for brand marketers\".\n\nWith the addition of videos to the platform, Facebook said it will help brands tell a more \"compelling\" story within a news feed.\n\nIn an interview with Campaign, Graham Mudd, the director of ad product marketing at Facebook, said: \"The shift in consumer behaviour to mobile devices will change marketing.\n\n\"These products will help in this mobile-first world and take advantage of the capabilities of mobile devices.\n\n\"For us, that's the primary focus \u2013 to help advertisers take advantage. We compare this with the shift from radio to TV.\n\n\"It was important to understand the difference in the medium and how to take advantage, so the same learning is needed in mobile.\"\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Facebook is introducing a new way for advertisers to analyse the impact of their ads on people using mobiles.

So, you know how there's this thing called Facebook that's like a big computer thingy that lots of people use to talk to their friends and family and see funny videos and stuff? Well, the people who make Facebook are always trying to make it better for advertisers, so they can show their ads to more people who might be interested in what they're selling.\n\nSo, they just announced some new things that will help advertisers show their ads to the right people, like if they want to show their ads to women between 35 and 54, the computer will help them find more people like that who might be interested in their stuff. And they're also adding videos to something called a carousel, which is like a big picture book that people can look at on their phones.\n\nAnd they're working with some other companies to make sure that their ads are working well and reaching the right people. It's like when you're trying to find a new toy, and you look in different places to find the one you want. That's what Facebook is doing for advertisers, they're helping them find the right people to show their ads to, so they can sell more toys... I mean, stuff! \ud83d\ude0a\""}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 148, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63469936667ba15958274dc7_64e625aeca17822e898b685c", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "3", "complexity_b": "4", "assertive_a": "4", "assertive_b": "2"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 21s "}}
