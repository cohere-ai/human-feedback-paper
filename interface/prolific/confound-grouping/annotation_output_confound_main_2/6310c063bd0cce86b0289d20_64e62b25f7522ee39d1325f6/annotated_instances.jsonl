{"id": "453", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Dive Brief:\n\nInside Higher Ed has produced its annual Survey of Faculty Attitudes on Technology, which reveals a large pool of dissatisfaction among professors about the value of technology in teaching and learning.\n\nA majority of those faculty surveyed said it is harder to justify technology investments because the student outcomes aren't matching the inputs, most faculty members do not discuss scholarship on social media, and that only a third of faculty members say they are included on decisions about how to use data mining services and applications.\n\nProfessors also indicated that they recognize the evolution of scholarly journals moving to open-access formats, but say that they fear peer-review is in jeopardy as a result.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe divided embrace of technology by faculty is an age-old challenge in higher education, but sharply contrasts other surveys suggesting that faculty members understand, and even expect for institutions to mandate technological development. In the end, executives have to help faculty to realize how tech integration efforts, training, and usage for teaching and learning all come together to improve the academic enterprise.\n\nWithout tech infusion, there is little room to expand foundations for competency-based education, innovations in distance learning, or assessment to ensure that different kinds of students are primed for success. The culture should not be one of faculty reacting negatively to technology as a hindrance, but leadership positively promoting it as an asset in the work environment.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "A new survey of faculty attitudes towards technology in higher education has found that professors are generally unhappy with the value of technology in teaching and learning, and that only a third of faculty are included in decisions about the use of data mining services and applications. The survey, produced by Inside Higher Ed, also found that most faculty members do not discuss scholarship on social media, and that a majority of those surveyed said it is harder to justify technology investments because student outcomes do not match inputs. The report highlights the divide between expectations of technology in higher education and the reality of its use by faculty, and calls for more leadership in promoting the use of technology in the academic enterprise.", "Response B": "A majority of faculty members are not happy with the value of technology in teaching and learning.
