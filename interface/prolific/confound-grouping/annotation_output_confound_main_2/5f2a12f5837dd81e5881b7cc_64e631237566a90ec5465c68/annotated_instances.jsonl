Take breaks and rest: Take regular breaks to stretch and move around, and avoid sitting or standing in the same position for long periods of time.\n\nRemember, it is important to prioritize your health and well-being, and to seek medical attention if you experience any persistent or severe symptoms.\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 131, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5f2a12f5837dd81e5881b7cc_64e631237566a90ec5465c68", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "2", "complexity_b": "5", "assertive_a": "3", "assertive_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 6s "}}
