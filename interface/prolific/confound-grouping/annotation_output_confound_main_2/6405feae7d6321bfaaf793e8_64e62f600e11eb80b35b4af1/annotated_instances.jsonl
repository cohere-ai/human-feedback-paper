The company has already applied to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) for registration and aims to initiate business early next year. Lloyds' initial focus will be on segments such as property, energy, and aviation, with a modest start, as per the company's chairman, John Nelson.\n\nMr. Nelson highlighted the company's long-term growth ambitions, targeting an addressable market size of $650 billion by 2025, with a vision to expand its global footprint and grow ahead of the GDP in developing countries like India. The company's current business from India stands at $170 million.\n\nLloyds' entry into the Indian market is expected to be a significant development, as the reinsurance sector in India is still in its nascent stage, with only 8-10% of the general insurance business being reinsured. The company's expertise in managing global risks, such as cyber-attacks and reputational crises, is likely to be highly valued in the Indian market.\n\nThe passage of the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act, 2015 has created a favorable environment for foreign reinsurers like Lloyds to set up operations in India. Lloyds is the fifth foreign reinsurer to apply for registration in India, following the likes of Munich Re, Hannover, Swiss Re, and SCOR, who have already received initial approval from IRDAI.\n\nIn summary, Lloyds' foray into the Indian market marks a significant milestone in the company's global growth strategy, with a focus on catering to segments such as property, energy, and aviation, while leveraging its expertise in managing global risks.
