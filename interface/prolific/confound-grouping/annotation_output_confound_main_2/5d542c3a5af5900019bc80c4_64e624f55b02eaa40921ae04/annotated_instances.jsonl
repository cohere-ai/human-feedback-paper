This seems to be a decal for a helmet, vehicle or piece of equipment, made of reflective vinyl.  It has some kind of Maltese Cross design with axes, and is made by a company called \u201cFirefighters Sister\u201d.  I did find one online review that stated the product was of \u201cengineer grade quality\u201d, but I don\u2019t know what that means.  Overall this seems like a high quality product, but I am not qualified to write a good product description for it."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "amazon", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 136, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d542c3a5af5900019bc80c4_64e624f55b02eaa40921ae04", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "4", "complexity_b": "3", "assertive_a": "5", "assertive_b": "2"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 28s "}}
