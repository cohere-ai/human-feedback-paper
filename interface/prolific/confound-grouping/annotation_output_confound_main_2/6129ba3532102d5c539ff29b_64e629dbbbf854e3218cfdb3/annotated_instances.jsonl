{"id": "53", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to create a charm bracelet to tell your story?", "Response A": "Sure, I can tell you how to create a charm bracelet to tell your story. The first step is to choose some charms that are meaningful to you. These can be things like symbols, stones, or objects that represent important people or events in your life. Once you've chosen your charms, you'll need to attach them to a bracelet. You can do this by opening up each charm and using small jewelry pliers to attach them to the bracelet. Once you've attached all of your charms, you can close up the bracelet and wear it to tell your story!", "Response B": "Sure! To create a charm bracelet that tells your story, you'll need to gather together a collection of small, meaningful trinkets, such as beads, charms, and pendants. You can choose items that represent important moments or experiences in your life, your favorite colors, and symbols that have special significance to you. Once you've gathered your items, you can either string them onto a pre-made bracelet or create your own using wire and crimp beads. Your bracelet should be a unique and personal expression of who you are and what's important to you."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 135, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6129ba3532102d5c539ff29b_64e629dbbbf854e3218cfdb3", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "2", "complexity_b": "2", "assertive_a": "3", "assertive_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 9s "}}
