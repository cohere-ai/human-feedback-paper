To get eyebrow microblading, you'll need to go to a salon or spa that offers the service. They'll use a special pen to draw on your eyebrows, and then they'll use a machine to implant ink under your skin. It's a pretty simple process, and it can last for a long time.", "Response B": "Sure! Microblading is a form of tattooing that involves creating small, hairlike marks on the skin. It\u2019s a fairly new technique, but it\u2019s gaining popularity because it looks very natural. If you\u2019re interested in getting microblading, you\u2019ll need to find a professional tattoo artist who is experienced with this technique. You can search online or ask for recommendations. After you find a few candidates, you should schedule consultations with them to see if they\u2019re a good fit. Then you can make your decision and get the procedure done. I hope that helps! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 130, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6129ba3532102d5c539ff29b_64e62982afd8ded10e59ab25", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "2", "complexity_b": "3", "assertive_a": "2", "assertive_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 10s "}}
