Here are a few tips for painting a portrait of a dog:\n\n1. Start with a good photo of the dog. This will help you to capture the dog's personality and features accurately.\n\n2. Use a reference photo to help you with the proportions of the dog's face. This will ensure that the dog's features are accurate and proportional.\n\n3. Use a variety of brushstrokes and colors to create a sense of depth and texture in the painting. This will help to bring the dog's features to life.\n\n4. Use a light touch when painting the dog's fur. This will help to create a sense of softness and fluffiness.\n\n5. Be sure to capture the dog's personality in the painting. This can be done through the use of facial expressions and body language.\n\n6. Have fun! Painting a portrait of a dog should be a enjoyable experience. Don't be too hard on yourself if the painting doesn't turn out exactly as you had hoped."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 126, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5f0f59f3bc44f50f92845a05_64e628e7ae12c4f47a4976ec", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "1", "complexity_b": "1", "assertive_a": "1", "assertive_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 15s "}}
