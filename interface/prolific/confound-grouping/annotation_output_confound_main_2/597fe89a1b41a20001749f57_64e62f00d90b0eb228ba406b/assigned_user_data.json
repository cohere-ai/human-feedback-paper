First, you\u2019ll need to choose the dog you want to paint, and take some photos of it.  Then you\u2019ll need to get some paints and paintbrushes, and some paper to paint on.  You can use acrylic paint, since it\u2019s easy to work with and it dries quickly.  You\u2019ll also need a palette to mix the paint on, and some water.
