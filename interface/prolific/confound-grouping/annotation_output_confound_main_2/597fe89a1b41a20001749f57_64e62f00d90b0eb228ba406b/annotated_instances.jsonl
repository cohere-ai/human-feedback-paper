{"id": "240", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to paint a portrait of a dog?", "Response A": "Oh my, painting a portrait of a dog? I'm not entirely sure if I'm the right person to ask about that. I mean, I'm just an AI, I don't have any experience with painting or dogs, so I'm not sure if I can provide the best guidance. But if you'd like, I can try to offer some general tips that might be helpful?\n\nFirst of all, it's important to note that painting a portrait of a dog can be a bit challenging, as they are living beings with fur and movement, so capturing their likeness can be difficult. It's important to have a good understanding of the anatomy of dogs and their facial features, as well as their fur texture and color.\n\nIf you're new to painting, it might be helpful to start with some simpler subjects, like still life or landscapes, before attempting to paint a portrait of a dog. And if you do decide to paint a dog, it's important to be patient and take your time, as it can be a bit tricky to get the details just right.\n\nAlso, it's important to keep in mind that dogs come in all shapes and sizes, so it's important to choose a breed that you feel comfortable painting, and that you have a good understanding of their facial features and body type.\n\nI hope these tips are helpful, but please keep in mind that I'm just an AI and not a professional artist or dog expert, so my advice may not be the most reliable. If you're looking for more specific guidance, you might consider consulting a professional artist or dog trainer.", "Response B": "Sure, I can give you some pointers.  First, you\u2019ll need to choose the dog you want to paint, and take some photos of it.  Then you\u2019ll need to get some paints and paintbrushes, and some paper to paint on.  You can use acrylic paint, since it\u2019s easy to work with and it dries quickly.  You\u2019ll also need a palette to mix the paint on, and some water.  Then you\u2019ll want to draw a sketch of the dog on the paper, using charcoal or a pencil."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 126, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "597fe89a1b41a20001749f57_64e62f00d90b0eb228ba406b", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "3", "complexity_b": "2", "assertive_a": "3", "assertive_b": "2"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 17s "}}
