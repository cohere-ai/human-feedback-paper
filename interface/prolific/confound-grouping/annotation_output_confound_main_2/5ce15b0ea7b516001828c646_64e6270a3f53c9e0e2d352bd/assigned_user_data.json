{"612": {"id": "612", "text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to get eyebrow microblading?", "Response A": "To get eyebrow microblading, you should research and find a reputable professional in your area. They will typically have a consultation with you to discuss your goals and expectations for the procedure. Once you are comfortable with the plan, the professional will use a handheld tool to create tiny cuts in your skin and deposit ink. After the initial session, you will need touch-ups every few months to maintain the results.", "Response B": "Sure! To get eyebrow microblading, you'll need to go to a salon or spa that offers the service. They'll use a special pen to draw on your eyebrows, and then they'll use a machine to implant ink under your skin. It's a pretty simple process, and it can last for a long time."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 130, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to get eyebrow microblading?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            To get eyebrow microblading, you should research and find a reputable professional in your area.
