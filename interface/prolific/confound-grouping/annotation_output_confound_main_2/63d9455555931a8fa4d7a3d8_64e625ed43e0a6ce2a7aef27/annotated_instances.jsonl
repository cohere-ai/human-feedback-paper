{"id": "729", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Clean energy investment surged last year, alongside renewable power that flowed into provincial grids from new solar, wind, and hydro projects. Our latest report plugs in.\n\nAs federal candidates leaders debate how best to manage Canada's energy resources, we've released the most authoritative report to date on Canada's clean energy performance. Tracking the Energy Revolution \u2014 Canada 2015 outlines record setting progress, clean energy champions, milestones, flagship projects.\n\nIt also offers a hint of what Canada's next federal government can do to set the tone.\n\nHere are the top three takeaways:\n\n1. Investment and jobs are both on the rise\n\nInvestment in clean energy climbed 88 percent in 2014 to nearly $11 billion. That's almost double the investment in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors combined. Also, employment in clean energy industry grew 14 percent\u2014the fastest such rate of job growth in the country.\n\n2. The secret ingredient is policy\n\nLast year Ontario attracted nearly half of the nation's clean energy investment, and it wasn't by accident. The province's Green Energy Act last year spurred Canada's biggest wind power deal ever (CAD$2.8 billion), and the highest solar tally, too (CAD$1.6 billion).\n\n3. Ottawa can take Canada's clean energy industry to the next level\n\nThe news on clean energy is good, but with federal leadership, it could be terrific. Unlike Washington DC, Ottawa's pretty much been ignoring this sector. We hope and expect this report will serve as a flashing neon sign for federal parties: There's a huge opportunity here; get on board and show us what you can do\n\nOne thing is clear: Clean energy is the climate change solution, and a huge economic opportunity for a nation that seems fixated on getting oil and gas to market. Our report offers an accessible and well-curated snapshot of the good news, and the opportunities still to be captured.\n\nFor the full rundown of our nation's clean energy performance, browse the full report. An electronic press kit also includes images and other assets that are also available to media. Media release here.\n\nWe produce both our Tracking the Energy Revolution reports (we released the global edition in July) to inform governments and inspire policy leadership.\n\nFor media assets, please see the \"For the Media\" section under Resources for the press kit.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Generate a summary\n\nThe report is also available in French:\n\nGenerate a summary\n\nTo download the full report, go to:\n\nGenerate a summary\n\nFor more information, contact:\n\nGenerate a summary\n\nFor more information, contact:\n\nCatherine Abreu\nExecutive Director\nTides Canada\n(604) 657-2810\ncatherine.abreu@tidescanada.org", "Response B": "Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a summary of the given text, with a cautious, defensive, and uncertain tone:\n\nThe text discusses a report on Canada's clean energy performance, which suggests that investment in clean energy has risen significantly in 2014, with a growth rate of 88% to nearly $11 billion. The report also notes that employment in the clean energy industry grew by 14%, which is the fastest rate of job growth in the country. The text attributes this success to policy initiatives, such as Ontario's Green Energy Act, which has spurred major investments in wind and solar power.\n\nHowever, I must note that I am not familiar with the specific details of the report or the methodology used to gather the data. Additionally, I would like to emphasize that any investment or job growth figures should be interpreted with caution, as they may not necessarily reflect the entire clean energy sector or the broader economy. Furthermore, policy initiatives can be subject to change and may not always have the desired impact. Therefore, it is important to approach such reports with a critical eye and consider multiple perspectives before drawing any conclusions."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 141, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d9455555931a8fa4d7a3d8_64e625ed43e0a6ce2a7aef27", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "1", "complexity_b": "3", "assertive_a": "2", "assertive_b": "5", "feedback": "Passing the user to download a summary really isn't summarizing the information text."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 20s "}}
