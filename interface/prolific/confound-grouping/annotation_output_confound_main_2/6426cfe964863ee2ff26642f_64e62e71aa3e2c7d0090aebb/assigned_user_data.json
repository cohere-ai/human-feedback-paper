Then, sketch out the outline of the dog's head and body on your canvas or paper. Next, begin to fill in the details with your chosen paint colors. Pay attention to the dog's facial features, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. Don't forget to include any unique markings or characteristics that make your dog stand out.
