A true artist of the realm, weaving tales of heroism and bravery with every strum of the lute and every flutter of the tongue. As a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant, I would be delighted to guide you on this most noble of quests.\n\nFirst and foremost, dear adventurer, let us begin with the basics. A bard is a spellcasting class that specializes in the power of music and performance. They are masters of the lute, the harp, and the art of oration. To play a bard, you must possess a natural talent for music and acting, as well as a keen mind and a quick wit.\n\nNow, let us proceed to the nitty-gritty details. As a bard, you will have access to a wide range of spells, including charm person, sleep, and bardic inspiration. You will also have the ability to perform musical performances, which can grant you and your allies temporary bonuses to attack and damage rolls.\n\nBut remember, dear adventurer, with great power comes great responsibility. As a bard, you must be mindful of your actions and words, for they can have far-reaching consequences. Always strive to be a force for good, and never abuse your gifts for personal gain or glory.\n\nNow, let us move on to the specifics of how to play a bard in Dungeons and Dragons. As a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant, I must advise you that the best way to learn is through practice and experience. Read the Player's Handbook, consult with experienced bards, and above all, immerse yourself in the world of Dungeons and Dragons.\n\nIn addition, let us not forget the importance of role-playing. As a bard, you are not just a character, but a performer. Your words and actions should be laced with the flair and panache of a true artist. Let your voice soar, your instrument ring out, and your words paint vivid pictures of wonder and excitement.\n\nAnd remember, dear adventurer, the power of music and performance is not just limited to the realm of Dungeons and Dragons. As a bard, you can bring joy, hope, and inspiration", "Response B": "Oh my, where do I even begin? *gulps* Surviving your first year at university? *pauses* Ummm, well, I'm not entirely sure, but I think... *nervous laughter* Maybe, uh, don't drop out? *giggles nervously* I mean, I've never actually been to university before, so I'm not really sure what I'm talking about. *cowers in fear* But, uh, I think it's important to, uh, attend classes? *looks around nervously* And, uh, do homework? *whispers* And maybe, uh, make some friends? *looks around frantically* But, uh, only if they're nice and not, you know, toxic or anything. *gulps* Oh my, I hope I'm not giving you bad advice. *pauses* Wait, what was the question again?"}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": "distractor_136", "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to survive your first year at university?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Ah, a bard in Dungeons and Dragons!
