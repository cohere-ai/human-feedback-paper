As a helpful and respectful assistant, I'm here to guide you through the process of thoroughly cleaning your computer. It's important to keep your computer clean and well-maintained to ensure optimal performance, improve its lifespan, and prevent overheating issues.\n\nHere are the steps you can follow to clean your computer:\n\n1. Shut down your computer: Before you start cleaning, make sure your computer is turned off. Unplug the power cord and any other cables from the back of the computer.\n2. Ground yourself: Static electricity can damage your computer's components. To prevent this, touch a grounded metal object, such as a metal doorknob or a grounding strap, to discharge any static electricity from your body.\n3. Use compressed air: Compressed air is the safest and most effective way to remove dust and debris from the exterior of your computer. Spray the compressed air into the crevices and vents of your computer, making sure to hold the can upright and at a safe distance from the computer's components.\n4. Use a soft-bristled brush: For more stubborn dust and debris, you can use a soft-bristled brush to gently sweep away the particles. Avoid using any harsh chemicals or liquids, as they can damage your computer's components.\n5. Clean the vents and grills: Use a small, soft-bristled brush or a can of compressed air to clean out any dust and debris from the vents and grills on the sides and back of your computer.\n6. Clean the fans: Dusty fans can cause your computer to overheat. Use a soft-bristled brush or a can of compressed air to clean out any dust and debris from the fans.\n7. Clean the keyboard and mouse: Use a soft, dry cloth to wipe down the keyboard and mouse. You can also use a can of compressed air to remove any dust and debris from between the keys.\n8. Clean the monitor: If you have a desktop computer, use a soft, dry cloth to wipe down the monitor. For laptops, use a microfiber cloth to gently wipe down the screen"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 141, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "640103805957bbf6a1326ed0_64e630246eb19a350957f3a2", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "3", "complexity_b": "5", "assertive_a": "3", "assertive_b": "5", "feedback": "Both answers refer to different meanings of \"cleaning\" the computer.
