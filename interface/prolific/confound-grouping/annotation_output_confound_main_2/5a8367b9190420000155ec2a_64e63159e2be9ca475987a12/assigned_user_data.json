You could apply a traditional eyeliner, which will create a very defined look. You could also use an eye shadow that contains shimmery pigments, which will give your eyelids a subtle, iridescent shine. Another option is to use a cream-based product, such as an eye shadow primer, to give your eyelids a dewy, shiny appearance."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 137, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to create glossy eyelids?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            To create glossy eyelids, you will need the following supplies:<br/><br/>- Eye shadow<br/>- Eye liner<br/>- Mascara<br/>- Lip gloss<br/><br/>To create the glossy eyelids, start by applying a layer of eye shadow to your eyelids.
