I've heard that it can be dangerous to do so, and I'm not sure if I'm qualified to give advice on the topic.  I'm not a electrician or a physicist, so I'm not sure if I can provide accurate information.

One way is to use a soft, lint-free towel and wipe it very carefully, using only water or a very mild soap. You should be very gentle and careful not to scratch the surface of the bulb, and wipe the towel over the bulb until it is clean. Another way is to use a special bulb cleaner, which you can find at most hardware stores or home improvement stores. You can also mix a small amount of vinegar with some warm water in a bowl and use a soft cloth to clean the bulb, which is a very safe and effective way to clean it."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 134, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to clean a light bulb?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            I'm not sure if it's a good idea to clean a light bulb.
