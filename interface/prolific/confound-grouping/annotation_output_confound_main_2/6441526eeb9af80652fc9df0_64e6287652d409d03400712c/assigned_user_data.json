Our latest report plugs in.\n\nAs federal candidates leaders debate how best to manage Canada's energy resources, we've released the most authoritative report to date on Canada's clean energy performance. Tracking the Energy Revolution \u2014 Canada 2015 outlines record setting progress, clean energy champions, milestones, flagship projects.\n\nIt also offers a hint of what Canada's next federal government can do to set the tone.\n\nHere are the top three takeaways:\n\n1. Investment and jobs are both on the rise\n\nInvestment in clean energy climbed 88 percent in 2014 to nearly $11 billion. That's almost double the investment in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors combined. Also, employment in clean energy industry grew 14 percent\u2014the fastest such rate of job growth in the country.\n\n2. The secret ingredient is policy\n\nLast year Ontario attracted nearly half of the nation's clean energy investment, and it wasn't by accident. The province's Green Energy Act last year spurred Canada's biggest wind power deal ever (CAD$2.8 billion), and the highest solar tally, too (CAD$1.6 billion).\n\n3. Ottawa can take Canada's clean energy industry to the next level\n\nThe news on clean energy is good, but with federal leadership, it could be terrific. Unlike Washington DC, Ottawa's pretty much been ignoring this sector. We hope and expect this report will serve as a flashing neon sign for federal parties: There's a huge opportunity here; get on board and show us what you can do\n\nOne thing is clear: Clean energy is the climate change solution, and a huge economic opportunity for a nation that seems fixated on getting oil and gas to market. Our report offers an accessible and well-curated snapshot of the good news, and the opportunities still to be captured.\n\nFor the full rundown of our nation's clean energy performance, browse the full report. An electronic press kit also includes images and other assets that are also available to media.

Here's the summary:\n\nVodafone and Idea Cellular are combining their businesses to make a big company with lots of customers! They will have nearly 400 million customers, which is a lot! This will help them compete better in India's telecom market, where there are many other companies too. Vodafone will own 45% of the new company, and Idea's owner will own the rest. The deal will let Vodafone reduce its trouble in India, but India still has a lot of opportunities for telecom operators in the future because there are many people who don't have internet yet!", "Response B": "Canada's clean energy sector has experienced a remarkable upsurge in investment and job creation, with a significant increase in investment and employment rates in 2014. This growth is largely attributed to the enactment of supportive policies, particularly the Green Energy Act in Ontario, which has attracted a substantial portion of the nation's clean energy investment. The report suggests that effective federal leadership could catalyze further growth and capture additional opportunities in the sector.\n\nThe report highlights the substantial jump in investment, amounting to nearly $11 billion, a rise of 88% from the previous year. This investment influx has not only created a significant number of jobs but has also positioned the clean energy sector as a leading driver of economic growth in Canada, outperforming other sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and fishing.\n\nThe report emphasizes the pivotal role of policy in fostering the growth of the clean energy sector. The Green Energy Act in Ontario has been instrumental in spurring investment and driving the development of wind and solar power projects. The report urges federal leaders to take note of this success and adopt similar policies to harness the full potential of the clean energy sector.\n\nThe report provides a comprehensive overview of Canada's clean energy performance, offering a wealth of information on milestones, flagship projects, and champion companies. It serves as a valuable resource for policymakers, investors, and other stakeholders looking to tap into the vast potential of the clean energy sector.\n\nIn conclusion, the report presents a compelling case for the importance of clean energy in Canada's economic and environmental future. By leveraging supportive policies and harnessing the potential of the clean energy sector, Canada can make significant strides in addressing climate change while driving economic growth and job creation."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": "distractor_141", "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Clean energy investment surged last year, alongside renewable power that flowed into provincial grids from new solar, wind, and hydro projects.
