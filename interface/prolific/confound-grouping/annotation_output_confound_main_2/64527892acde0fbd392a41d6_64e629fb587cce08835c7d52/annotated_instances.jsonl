{"id": "492", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to clean a light bulb?", "Response A": "There are a few different ways to clean a light bulb. One way is to use a soft, lint-free towel and wipe it very carefully, using only water or a very mild soap. You should be very gentle and careful not to scratch the surface of the bulb, and wipe the towel over the bulb until it is clean. Another way is to use a special bulb cleaner, which you can find at most hardware stores or home improvement stores. You can also mix a small amount of vinegar with some warm water in a bowl and use a soft cloth to clean the bulb, which is a very safe and effective way to clean it.", "Response B": "Cleaning a light bulb can be a delicate task, especially if the bulb is hot. To prevent injury, it is recommended to turn off the power and allow the bulb to cool down before attempting to clean it. Once the bulb has cooled down, use a soft cloth or paper towel to gently wipe the bulb and remove any dust or debris. Avoid using water or harsh chemicals, as these can damage the bulb. If the bulb is coated in a film, you can try using a mixture of equal parts water and white vinegar to gently wipe it away. It is important to follow manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when cleaning a light bulb."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_2", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 134, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "64527892acde0fbd392a41d6_64e629fb587cce08835c7d52", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "1", "complexity_b": "1", "assertive_a": "4", "assertive_b": "3", "feedback": "Response A answered the question more directly than B."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 30s "}}
