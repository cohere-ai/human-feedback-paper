Section 520(o)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, states that software that is intended \"for maintaining or encouraging a healthy lifestyle and is unrelated to the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, prevention, or treatment of a disease or condition\" is not a device under section 201(h) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThis guidance clarifies FDA's interpretation of this provision and its application to general wellness products.\n\n1 This guidance does not change or rescind any requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) or any applicable regulations. This guidance also does not preclude FDA from consulting with the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) as to whether a general wellness product is a consumer product under CPSC's authority or a device. FDA may coordinate with other agencies and authorities, such as the CPSC, to determine jurisdiction over products. If a product is a device under section 201(h) of the FD&C Act, it is generally excluded from CPSC's authority over \"consumer products\" under the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2052(a)(5)(ii)(H)). However, CPSC and FDA may both have jurisdiction over certain medical devices under other statutory authorities the CPSC administers.\n\n2 For determinations on combination products, contact the Office of Combination Products at combination@fda.gov. See 21 CFR 3.2(e) for the definition of a combination product.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The FDA has issued a guidance document to provide clarity to industry and FDA staff on the Center for Devices and Radiological Health's (CDRH's) compliance policy for low risk products that promote a healthy lifestyle.
