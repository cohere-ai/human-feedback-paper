As part of the hiring, Marakby will relocate from Detroit to Pittsburgh to join Uber as vice president of global vehicle programs where he will oversee \"manufacturer strategy and integration efforts\".\n\nOf course, Uber hasn't confirmed its specific plans to build self-driving cars, however Brian McClendon, former vice president in the mapping division of Google, is running the self-driving car efforts at Uber's Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh.\n\n\"Self-driving technology is a hard challenge to solve with enormous potential to improve people's lives,\" McClendon said in a statement. \"Sherif is a world expert and we're excited to have him join the team.\"\n\nAt a time when Uber's global power is rising, it poached an entire team of roughly 50 people at Carnegie Mellon's top robotics research lab earlier this year to bring to the self-driving car project. The private company is valued at $62.5 billion based on recent funding rounds.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "You are correct that this program represents an important step in the direction of public-private partnerships to address the problem of workforce development.  The federal government is also engaged in a number of other initiatives to address the problem of skyrocketing tuition costs and poor post-graduate career outcomes.  As many traditional universities are being questioned by the government about how they spend their endowment money, and as enrollment is decreasing at most institutions, universities will need to evaluate these types of partnerships as potential models for the future.  It is also possible that the government may alter its student loan programs to encourage such partnerships.", "Response B": "Responding in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if I am unfamiliar with the topic: \n\nUber has poached Sherif Marakby, director of global electronics and engineering at Ford, in what is a move believed to bolster its self-driving car program.
