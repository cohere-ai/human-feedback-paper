Basically, Yahoo! invisible scanning is a special method of internet scanning which can be used to detect internet users who are attempting to conceal their online activity.  The Yahoo! invisible scan uses special software which emulates human internet browsing behavior in order to detect any users who are attempting to conceal their online activity.  This is often used by internet service providers in order to detect and prevent internet users from illicit activities such as child pornography, hacking, or spying.  The Yahoo! invisible scanning software is very advanced and can detect almost all forms of internet obscuring techniques, making it very effective at detecting concealed users.  However, it should be noted that some advanced techniques can evade Yahoo! invisible scanning, so it is not 100% effective.
