Here's how you can make one:\n\n1. Get a notebook or a special journal that you like. It can be any size or shape, but it should have blank pages.\n2. Choose a comfortable place to sit and think about your dreams. You can do this in your bed, on a couch, or even outside in a pretty garden.\n3. Before you go to sleep, make sure you have your journal and a pen or pencil.\n4. When you wake up, try to remember your dreams. If you can't remember anything, that's okay! Just write down any little thing you do remember, like a color or a feeling.\n5. Write down your dreams in your journal, using your own words. Don't worry too much about spelling or grammar, just focus on getting everything down on paper.\n6. If you have a dream that you really like, you can draw a picture of it too!\n7. Keep your journal by your bed so you can write in it every night.\n\nRemember, your dream journal is a special place where you can write down all your secret dreams and ideas. It's just for you, so don't worry if it's not perfect. Have fun with it, and who knows, maybe one day you'll look back and see all the amazing things you dreamed up! \ud83d\ude04"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 112, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6129ba3532102d5c539ff29b_64e4cee06d74e3b847dd3daf", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "1", "complexity_b": "4", "assertive_a": "1", "assertive_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 5s "}}
