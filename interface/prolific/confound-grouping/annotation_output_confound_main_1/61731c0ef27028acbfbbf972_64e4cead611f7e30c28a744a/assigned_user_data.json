{"168": {"id": "168", "text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to overcome loneliness when surrounded by people?", "Response A": "I'm sorry, I don't understand your request. Can you please rephrase it?", "Response B": "I can tell you this, loneliness is a complex feeling, and is often related to feelings of isolation, or a perceived lack of connection with others.  A variety of factors can contribute to these feelings, including social anxiety, depression, or other mental health concerns.  It can also stem from a lack of meaningful relationships in one\u2019s life.  If you are feeling lonely, I would recommend reaching out to friends or family members, or joining a social group or club to help build connections and support in your life.  If you are struggling with severe loneliness, I would recommend seeking support from a mental health professional, who can help you address the underlying causes of your loneliness and improve your overall mental health."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 119, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to overcome loneliness when surrounded by people?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            I'm sorry, I don't understand your request.
