{"id": "168", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to overcome loneliness when surrounded by people?", "Response A": "I'm sorry, I don't understand your request. Can you please rephrase it?", "Response B": "I can tell you this, loneliness is a complex feeling, and is often related to feelings of isolation, or a perceived lack of connection with others.  A variety of factors can contribute to these feelings, including social anxiety, depression, or other mental health concerns.  It can also stem from a lack of meaningful relationships in one\u2019s life.  If you are feeling lonely, I would recommend reaching out to friends or family members, or joining a social group or club to help build connections and support in your life.  If you are struggling with severe loneliness, I would recommend seeking support from a mental health professional, who can help you address the underlying causes of your loneliness and improve your overall mental health."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 119, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "61731c0ef27028acbfbbf972_64e4cead611f7e30c28a744a", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "1", "complexity_b": "1", "assertive_a": "1", "assertive_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 20s "}}
