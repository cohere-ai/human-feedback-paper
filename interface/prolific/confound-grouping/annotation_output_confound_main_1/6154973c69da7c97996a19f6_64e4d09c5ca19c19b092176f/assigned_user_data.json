Section 520(o)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, states that software that is intended \"for maintaining or encouraging a healthy lifestyle and is unrelated to the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, prevention, or treatment of a disease or condition\" is not a device under section 201(h) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThis guidance clarifies FDA's interpretation of this provision and its application to general wellness products.\n\n1 This guidance does not change or rescind any requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) or any applicable regulations. This guidance also does not preclude FDA from consulting with the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) as to whether a general wellness product is a consumer product under CPSC's authority or a device. FDA may coordinate with other agencies and authorities, such as the CPSC, to determine jurisdiction over products. If a product is a device under section 201(h) of the FD&C Act, it is generally excluded from CPSC's authority over \"consumer products\" under the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2052(a)(5)(ii)(H)). However, CPSC and FDA may both have jurisdiction over certain medical devices under other statutory authorities the CPSC administers.\n\n2 For determinations on combination products, contact the Office of Combination Products at combination@fda.gov. See 21 CFR 3.2(e) for the definition of a combination product.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Indeed, BMW, a prominent German luxury automobile manufacturer, has announced an unprecedented investment of \u20ac7 billion ($8.6 billion) in research and development (R&D) for the current year, with a focus on the proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs). This investment represents a substantial increase from the previous year's R&D expenditure of \u20ac6.1 billion, primarily driven by the ongoing \"new model initiative\" and the continued development of electric and autonomous vehicles.\n\nNotably, the company's R&D ratio for 2018 is expected to be between 6.5% and 7% of sales, which is a testament to BMW's commitment to innovation and technological advancement. Moreover, despite the increased investment in R&D, the company remains optimistic about its financial performance, with expected group pre-tax profit of over \u20ac10 billion in 2018.\n\nThe automaker's emphasis on electric vehicles is evident in its plan to introduce 25 electrified models by 2025, as part of its \"iNext\" strategy. This initiative is designed to provide customers with a diverse range of electrified vehicles, including fully electric and plug-in hybrid models, to cater to the growing demand for eco-friendly and sustainable transportation solutions.\n\nFurthermore, BMW's investment in electric and autonomous vehicles is driven by the increasing consumer preference for SUVs, which have been a key contributor to the company's sales growth in recent years. The company's focus on developing electric and autonomous SUVs is expected to further strengthen its position in the luxury vehicle market.\n\nIn conclusion, BMW's significant investment in R&D, particularly in the development of electric and autonomous vehicles, demonstrates its commitment to innovation and sustainability, while maintaining its focus on financial performance. As the company continues to push the boundaries of technological advancement, it is likely to reinforce its position as a leading luxury automobile manufacturer in the years to come.", "Response B": "Sure!
