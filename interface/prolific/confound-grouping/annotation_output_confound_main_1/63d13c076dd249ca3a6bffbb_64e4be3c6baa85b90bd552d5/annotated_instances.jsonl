{"id": "994", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to bowl?", "Response A": "Sure! Bowling is a game that involves rolling a heavy ball down a lane towards a set of pins. The objective is to knock over as many pins as possible. \n\nTo bowl, you will need a bowling ball, a set of bowling pins, and a lane. You can find these items at most bowling alleys.\n\nTo begin, you will need to position the bowling ball at the head of the lane. You can then roll the ball down the lane towards the pins. The pins will be knocked over as the ball rolls down the lane.\n\nOnce the ball has reached the pins, you will need to adjust your aim and roll the ball again. You can continue to roll the ball until all of the pins have been knocked over.\n\nIt's important to note that bowling is a game of skill and precision. You will need to practice and develop your technique to become a better bowler.", "Response B": "I think so. I've never actually done it myself, but I've seen it done. I think you start by standing at the line with the ball in your hand. Then you take a step forward and let the ball go. It should roll down the lane and knock over the pins. I think."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 111, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d13c076dd249ca3a6bffbb_64e4be3c6baa85b90bd552d5", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "1", "complexity_b": "1", "assertive_a": "4", "assertive_b": "1"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 46s "}}
