{"id": "656", "input_text": {"Prompt": "This paper assesses the impact of climate change and Saudi-Yemen ongoing war on Yemen's economy, agriculture, households and health and the proposed solutions for adaptation to climate change.\n\nThe world's climate is changing and will continue to change into the coming century at rates projected to be unprecedented in recent human history. Climate change has made weather less predictable and has increased environmental degradation. Environmental degradation has historically influenced political stability. Variables like rapid population change, water and food scarcity, migration, energy and natural resources consumption are already causing problems and will continue to be impacted by climate change.\n\nThis study focuses on the impact of climate change and ongoing Saudi war on Yemen. Population growth in Yemen is among the highest in the world, with an average annual growth rate of 3% in recent years. Almost one-third of Yemenis or 7.5 million people do not have enough food to satisfy their needs. Results also show that 57.9% of all children strategy is implemented properly, farmers will be more than compensated for the loss of Qat revenues, and Yemen's food security will improve.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The PIQ Robot is a wearable sensor that captures and analyzes data about body movement in sports, and the GAIA Intelligence software uses various motion-capture algorithms to evaluate this data.  The software is able to break down body movement related to a specific sport, and will continue to learn from the movement of the user each time they use the PIQ Robot.  The goal of integrating the GAIA Intelligence software with the PIQ Robot is to enable athletes to benefit from personalized advice that will help them improve their performance.", "Response B": "Unfamiliar with the topic, a cautious, defensive and uncertain response would be:\n\nClimate change threatens to worsen already entrenched socioeconomic challenges in Yemen, including water and food insecurity, poor health and high rates of child malnutrition, which have contributed to the world's largest humanitarian crisis. These challenges will be compounded by the adverse impacts of climate change on rainfall and temperature patterns, which will affect crop yields, the country\u2019s primary source of food and income. Yemen\u2019s high population growth, coupled with the projected impact of climate change on rainfall and temperature patterns, is expected to increase pressure on natural resources and exacerbate competition over scarce water and arable land. Climate change is projected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, which will further strain Yemen\u2019s fragile agricultural sector and exacerbate food insecurity. The conflict in Yemen has significantly worsened the country\u2019s already dire humanitarian situation, with more than 80% of the population in need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe long-term impacts of the climate change will be exacerbated by the ongoing conflict, which has destroyed critical infrastructure, infrastructure, and services, and hindered efforts to address the growing humanitarian crisis. The conflict has also disrupted vital imports of food, fuel, and medical supplies, leading to severe food insecurity and a growing risk of famine. The combination of climate change and conflict will have devastating consequences for Yemen\u2019s already vulnerable population, increasing the risk of hunger, disease, and malnutrition, and threatening the gains made in recent years to reduce child"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": "distractor_106", "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "62effa539a08b7896593d694_64e4e5258dfacc12ae232a3a", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "2", "complexity_b": "3", "assertive_a": "1", "assertive_b": "4", "feedback": "Response B is immediately noticeable as a better response, as response A has literally nothing to do with the prompt."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 56s "}}
