First, you need to cut the chicken breast in half horizontally, so that you have two thin pieces of chicken.  Then, you need to pound the chicken thin with a mallet or a rolling pin.  Finally, you need to season the chicken with salt and pepper.  I hope this helps!", "Response B": "Yes, I can.  First, you need to peel the shrimp.  Then, you need to butterfly them.  To do this, you need to cut them in half down the middle, and then open them up like a book.  Then, you need to season them with salt and pepper, and then cook them in a pan with some butter.  Once they are cooked, you can serve them with some lemon wedges."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 115, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5fbd18be2b7651043385b705_64e4c015a23fa334653d8938", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "4", "complexity_b": "4", "assertive_a": "4", "assertive_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 38s "}}
