They are supposed to tell you about the personality of the person whose palm you\u2019re reading.  The biggest one is the mount of Saturn, which is right at the base of the thumb.  The other mounts are the mount of Jupiter, which is right next to it on the palm, and the mount of Apollo, which is near the base of the little finger.", "Response B": "I\u2019ve actually never really looked at the mount of the palm before. I\u2019ve heard of it, but I don\u2019t know much about it.
