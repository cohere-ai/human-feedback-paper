Use a strong and unique password for your Yahoo! account.\n2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an extra layer of security.\n3. Be cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources, as they may contain malware or phishing scams.\n4. Regularly review your account activity and update your security questions and answers.\n5. Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate strong passwords.\n\nRemember, it is important to prioritize online security and privacy, and to only engage in activities that are legal and ethical."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 108, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "61731c0ef27028acbfbbf972_64e4d060a51b7ea21c6a4302", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "1", "complexity_b": "5", "assertive_a": "5", "assertive_b": "1"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 28s "}}
