The mounts are the fleshy areas on the palm that are located between the fingers and the base of the hand. They are named after the planets in the solar system, and each mount is associated with a specific planet.\n\nTo read the mounts of the palm, a palmist will look at the shape, size, and texture of each mount. They will also consider the lines that intersect the mounts, as these can provide additional information about the person's life and personality. The mounts can indicate a person's strengths, weaknesses, and potential for growth and development.\n\nIt is important to note that reading the mounts of the palm is not an exact science, and there is no guarantee that the information obtained will be accurate. It is also important to consult with a reputable and experienced palmist to ensure that the reading is accurate and reliable."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": "distractor_105", "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5ed403a89542210ab77530b7_64e4bfb66a3dacf2ea356f9c", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "3", "complexity_b": "5", "assertive_a": "1", "assertive_b": "1", "feedback": "response a is unrelated"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 28s "}}
