About 170 robots will be deployed in the early 2020s. The budget for the development is estimated to be less than 500 billion won. The development will start in 2017. The demining robots will be used not only for removing landmines in the DMZ but also for handling explosives. The plan is in response to the North Korean landmine attack that wounded two South Korean soldiers in the DMZ. The military will also develop 100 unmanned vehicles for search operations in the DMZ.", "Response B": "The South Korean military will develop robots to detect and remove mines in the DMZ, with the project scheduled to be completed in the early 2020s. The military will also develop 100 unmanned vehicles for DMZ search operations.
