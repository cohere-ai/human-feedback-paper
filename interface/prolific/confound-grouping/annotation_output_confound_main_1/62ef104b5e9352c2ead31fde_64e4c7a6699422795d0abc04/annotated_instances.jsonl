{"id": "54", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to play scribblenauts?", "Response A": "Sure! Scrabble is a word game where you and your opponent take turns forming words on a board using tiles. The words can be any combination of letters, and they can be used to score points. The game ends when one player has no more tiles left.\n\nTo play, you and your opponent take turns forming words on the board. Each word must be made up of letters that are in the correct order and that can be used to score points. For example, the word \"cat\" would not be a valid word because it is not made up of the correct order of letters.\n\nYou can also use special tiles to score extra points. For example, the word \"car\" would be a valid word, but you could also use the tile \"c\" to score an extra point.\n\nThe game ends when one player has no more tiles left. At this point, the player with the most points wins.", "Response B": "Absolutely! Scribblenauts is a puzzle video game developed by 5th Cell and published by Nintendo. It was released in 2009 for the Nintendo DS, and in 2010 for the Wii U. The game is a sequel to the 2006 game, Scribblenauts: The Complete Collection. \n\nThe game is played from a first-person perspective, with the player controlling the character using the DS's touch screen.
