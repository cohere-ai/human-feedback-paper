{"id": "277", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Two infants diagnosed with an aggressive and previously incurable form of leukemia are now in remission, after British doctors say they cured the babies using so-called \"designer cells.\"\n\nIt is the first time in history that cancer has been treated using genetically engineered immune cells from a donor. Details of the two cases were published Wednesday in Science Translational Medicine.\n\nIn each case, scientists engineered a type of immune cell called a T cell to attack cancer cells. Each of the two infants, aged 11 and 16 months, had undergone many previous treatments, and all of them had failed. One of the infants, Layla Richards, attracted press attention in the fall when scientists at Great Ormond Street Hospital announced that Richards, who was diagnosed with cancer at just three months old, was vastly improved just a few months after beginning treatment. But at the time, scientists were hesitant to say that she had been cured. Now, the scientists say that Richards is in remission\u2014and that they have cured a second baby as well, lending more evidence to the therapy's effectiveness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe treatment entailed collecting blood from donors, isolating healthy immune T-cells, and then using a genetic engineering tool known as TALENs to deactivate certain T-cell genes that would normally cause them to be rejected once transplanted into a leukemia patient. The T-cells were also engineered to attack cancer cells directly.\n\nSimilar treatments using engineered T-cells have been highly successful against blood cancers in other studies. But those studies rely on a patients own blood cells being altered. Using donated cells offers the potential for a cheaper, faster cure.\n\nG/O Media may get a commission 10% off 10% off Wish A gift for literally everybody.\n\nGifts under $20, $10, and even $5.

Still, these early results are promising.\n\n[Science Translational Medicine]\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Two infants with aggressive and previously incurable forms of leukemia are now in remission, after British doctors said they cured the babies using so-called \"designer cells.\"", "Response B": "Two babies have been cured of cancer using new technology.
