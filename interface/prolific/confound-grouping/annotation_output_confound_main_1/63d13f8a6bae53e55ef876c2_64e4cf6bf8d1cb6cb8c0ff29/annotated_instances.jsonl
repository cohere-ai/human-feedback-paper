{"id": "121", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to buy a condo?", "Response A": "To buy a condo, you will need to research and find a condo that meets your needs and budget. Once you have found a condo that you are interested in, you should contact a real estate agent who specializes in condominiums. They can help you navigate the paperwork and legal aspects of buying a condo. You will also need to get a mortgage and may need to provide a down payment. Once you have completed all of the necessary steps, you will be able to move into your new condo!", "Response B": "Sure! First you need to decide what neighborhood you want to live in, and then you need to find a realtor you want to work with. You can look at condos online or in person, and when you find one you like you can make an offer. The seller can accept, reject, or counteroffer. Once you and the seller agree on a price and terms, you\u2019ll close on the condo and become the new owner!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 110, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d13f8a6bae53e55ef876c2_64e4cf6bf8d1cb6cb8c0ff29", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "3", "complexity_b": "2", "assertive_a": "3", "assertive_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 21s "}}
