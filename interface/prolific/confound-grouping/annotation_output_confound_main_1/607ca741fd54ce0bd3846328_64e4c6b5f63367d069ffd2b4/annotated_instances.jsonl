{"id": "594", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Dive Brief:\n\nDeclining costs, a mature market, easy-access bandwidth and better security are making cloud data storage more attractive to K-12 districts across the U.S.\n\nCloud computing lets districts store resources online, including websites, online learning applications, and even student information systems and school-specific human resources material.\n\nMany companies offering cloud storage services also have on-demand, around-the-clock support teams ready to assist should any problems arise; yet because the cloud is now more readily available, District Administration reports that many kinks have already been worked out.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nLike any storage system, cloud storage can be used with backups to avoid running into a data nightmare. Districts have been wise to back up systems and information, even with today's much more responsive and high-functioning cloud services.\n\nPrivate clouds are also an option, but it's one that requires more preparation and labor. District administrators choosing to use private cloud storage need a high level of expertise as well as internal system support and maintenance. Network attached storage is also a cost-effective, secure alternative.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The U.S. Department of Education has provided $17m in grants to fund the development of educational applications that will be hosted on the cloud, and in turn, help students with disabilities. The grants, provided by the Cloud Computing Initiative, will fund projects to create applications that are accessible to students with a range of disabilities, including those with visual impairments, speech impairments, and cognitive disabilities. The applications will be hosted on the cloud, which will allow for easy access and updates. The Department of Education hopes that the grants will help to increase the use of cloud-based applications in education and improve the accessibility of education for students with disabilities.", "Response B": "Cloud computing is becoming more appealing to U.S. K-12 districts because it's less expensive and more secure. It's also easier to access and has better customer service."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 101, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "607ca741fd54ce0bd3846328_64e4c6b5f63367d069ffd2b4", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "4", "complexity_b": "2", "assertive_a": "5", "assertive_b": "1"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 27s "}}
