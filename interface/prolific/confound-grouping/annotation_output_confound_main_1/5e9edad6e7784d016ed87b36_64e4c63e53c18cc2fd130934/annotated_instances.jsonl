Districts have been wise to back up systems and information, even with today's much more responsive and high-functioning cloud services.\n\nPrivate clouds are also an option, but it's one that requires more preparation and labor. District administrators choosing to use private cloud storage need a high level of expertise as well as internal system support and maintenance. Network attached storage is also a cost-effective, secure alternative.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Cloud computing is becoming more appealing to U.S. K-12 districts because it's less expensive and more secure.
