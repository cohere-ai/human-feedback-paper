{"id": "122", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Dive Brief:\n\nDeclining costs, a mature market, easy-access bandwidth and better security are making cloud data storage more attractive to K-12 districts across the U.S.\n\nCloud computing lets districts store resources online, including websites, online learning applications, and even student information systems and school-specific human resources material.\n\nMany companies offering cloud storage services also have on-demand, around-the-clock support teams ready to assist should any problems arise; yet because the cloud is now more readily available, District Administration reports that many kinks have already been worked out.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nLike any storage system, cloud storage can be used with backups to avoid running into a data nightmare. Districts have been wise to back up systems and information, even with today's much more responsive and high-functioning cloud services.\n\nPrivate clouds are also an option, but it's one that requires more preparation and labor. District administrators choosing to use private cloud storage need a high level of expertise as well as internal system support and maintenance. Network attached storage is also a cost-effective, secure alternative.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Cloud computing is becoming more appealing to U.S. K-12 districts because it's less expensive and more secure. It's also easier to access and has better customer service.", "Response B": "As the world becomes more and more digitized, the need for reliable and secure data storage options has become a top priority for K-12 districts. Cloud storage offers many benefits over traditional storage methods, including easier access to data, cost savings, and increased security. However, districts should still ensure they have the proper infrastructure and support in place to avoid potential data loss or security breaches. With the right planning and implementation, cloud storage can be a beneficial tool for K-12 schools."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 101, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6129ba3532102d5c539ff29b_64e4cf71b00c9e64d29dd187", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "2", "complexity_b": "4", "assertive_a": "2", "assertive_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 12s "}}
