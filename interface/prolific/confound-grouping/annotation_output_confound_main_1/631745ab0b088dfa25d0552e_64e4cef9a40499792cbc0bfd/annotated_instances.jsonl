{"id": "151", "input_text": {"Prompt": "The popularity of the short-term accommodation rental website Airbnb is skyrocketing in Vancouver \u2013 and recent research shows it may be negatively impacting an already tight rental market.\n\nAirbnb is the ideal option for many travelers around the world, especially those who balk at paying pricey hotel costs. And it's a growing trend: Simon Fraser urban studies graduate student Karen Sawatzky says there's been a 63 per cent jump year-over-year on Airbnb rentals in Vancouver \u2013 and not just during the busy tourist season.\n\n\"The number of Airbnb listings seems to be growing continually, even in the off-season,\" Sawatsky says, noting that in the last six months alone 1,000 more listings have been posted on the site, bringing the total to more than 4,700.\n\nThis means that many properties that could be rented out to locals for longer periods of time are no longer available, with some owners preferring to rent the accommodation out short-term.\n\n\"Any number of units that...could be rented out for long-term and are instead being rented out for short-term is going to have some kind of effect on the people on the ground who are looking for units,\" she says. \"And cost is related to supply.\"\n\nThe vacancy rate for rental properties in Vancouver is currently below one percent, Sawatzky says, while a healthy vacancy rate should be around three per cent.\n\nLandlord BC agrees, noting there are other huge issues with Airbnb. It's not only illegal without a special permit, but it can possibly contravene the residential tenancy act \u2013 and there are safety concerns.\n\n\"Obviously we don't want to see a whole bunch of strangers on a regular basis,\" says CEO David Hutniak. \"We want to really manage that part of it.\"\n\nThe City of Vancouver is currently studying the impact of Airbnb to see if more stringent regulation may be needed in the future.\n\nWith files from CTV Vancouver's Julie Nolin\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Airbnb is a popular rental website that is negatively impacting Vancouver's rental market.  Rentals are up 63% year over year, with a total of 4,700 rentals currently available.  With a vacancy rate of less than 1%, this can create a shortage of long-term rentals, and there are other issues such as safety and illegality without proper permits.  The city of Vancouver is studying the issue to determine if more regulations are needed.\n\nPlease note that I do not give legal advice or make claims about the legality of any activity.  It is important to consult with a qualified professional before making any decisions.  Additionally, it is important to be aware of and comply with all relevant laws and regulations when renting out properties.", "Response B": "Airbnb has caused a 63% rise in the number of short-term rentals in Vancouver, and is negatively impacting the local rental market, according to a new study by Simon Fraser University urban studies graduate student Karen Sawatzky. The number of listings on the site is rising continually, even in the off-season, Sawatzky said, with the total number of listings having increased by more than 4,700 in the last six months. The low vacancy rate for rental properties in Vancouver means that many properties that could be rented out to locals for longer periods are no longer available, with some owners preferring to rent the accommodation out short-term.
