{"1047": {"id": "1047", "text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to lose weight in wrestling?", "Response A": "Wrestling is a sport that involves a lot of physical activity, so to lose weight in wrestling you need to burn more calories than you consume. A good way to do this is to increase your cardio training, and to also watch your diet and make sure you are eating plenty of healthy, nutritious foods.  Some other ways to lose weight in wrestling include strength training, stretching, and cutting out unhealthy foods and drinks like sugary sodas and processed snacks.  You should also make sure you are getting enough sleep and drinking plenty of water every day.", "Response B": "Sure, there are many ways to lose weight in wrestling.  It depends on how much weight you want to lose, and how quickly.  If you are trying to lose just a few pounds, you might want to try cutting out sugary drinks and foods like candy and cake.  If you have more weight to lose, and can do it more gradually, you might want to cut out all processed foods, and make healthier food choices.  You might also want to consider taking up a new hobby that will help you burn calories, such as running, swimming, or wrestling."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 103, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to lose weight in wrestling?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Wrestling is a sport that involves a lot of physical activity, so to lose weight in wrestling you need to burn more calories than you consume.
