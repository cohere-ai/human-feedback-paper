They are often seen as weak or vulnerable.\n\nTo avoid being a pushover, you should try to be more confident and assertive. This will help you to stand up for yourself and to say no to things that you don't want to do.\n\nYou should also try to be more independent and self-sufficient. This will help you to feel more in control of your own life and to be less likely to be pushed around by others.\n\nFinally, you should try to be more informed and educated about the world around you.

Set boundaries and stick to them. Use language that is direct and clear, and avoid being overly apologetic or passive.
