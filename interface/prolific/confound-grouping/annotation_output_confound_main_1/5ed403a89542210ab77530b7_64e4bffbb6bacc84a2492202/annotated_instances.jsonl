{"id": "893", "input_text": {"Prompt": "This paper assesses the impact of climate change and Saudi-Yemen ongoing war on Yemen's economy, agriculture, households and health and the proposed solutions for adaptation to climate change.\n\nThe world's climate is changing and will continue to change into the coming century at rates projected to be unprecedented in recent human history. Climate change has made weather less predictable and has increased environmental degradation. Environmental degradation has historically influenced political stability. Variables like rapid population change, water and food scarcity, migration, energy and natural resources consumption are already causing problems and will continue to be impacted by climate change.\n\nThis study focuses on the impact of climate change and ongoing Saudi war on Yemen. Population growth in Yemen is among the highest in the world, with an average annual growth rate of 3% in recent years. Almost one-third of Yemenis or 7.5 million people do not have enough food to satisfy their needs. Results also show that 57.9% of all children strategy is implemented properly, farmers will be more than compensated for the loss of Qat revenues, and Yemen's food security will improve.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "This paper discusses the impact of climate change and the ongoing war in Yemen on the economy, agriculture, households, and health.

Over 1,000 people have died since the outbreak began in April, and more than 200,000 people are in hospital. The outbreak has been exacerbated by the country's ongoing civil war, which has destroyed water treatment plants and sewage systems. The WHO has called on all parties to the conflict to provide unhindered access to healthcare and to restore basic water and sanitation services."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 106, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5ed403a89542210ab77530b7_64e4bffbb6bacc84a2492202", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "4", "complexity_b": "2", "assertive_a": "5", "assertive_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 24s "}}
