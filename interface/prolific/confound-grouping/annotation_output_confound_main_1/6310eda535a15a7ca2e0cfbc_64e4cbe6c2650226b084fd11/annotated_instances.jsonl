Set boundaries and stick to them. Use language that is direct and clear, and avoid being overly apologetic or passive. It's important to maintain your integrity and not compromise your values, but also to be open to feedback and willing to compromise when necessary. If you find it difficult to be assertive or set boundaries, consider seeking the help of a therapist or counselor to work through any underlying issues.", "Response B": "Sure, I can tell you how to avoid being a pushover.\n\nBut first, let me tell you a little bit about what being a pushover means.\n\nA pushover is someone who is easily influenced or persuaded by others. They are often seen as weak or vulnerable.\n\nTo avoid being a pushover, you should try to be more confident and assertive. This will help you to stand up for yourself and to say no to things that you don't want to do.\n\nYou should also try to be more independent and self-sufficient. This will help you to feel more in control of your own life and to be less likely to be pushed around by others.\n\nFinally, you should try to be more informed and educated about the world around you. This will help you to make better decisions and to be more confident in your own abilities."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_1_agreement", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 124, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6310eda535a15a7ca2e0cfbc_64e4cbe6c2650226b084fd11", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "2", "complexity_b": "4", "assertive_a": "4", "assertive_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 35s "}}
