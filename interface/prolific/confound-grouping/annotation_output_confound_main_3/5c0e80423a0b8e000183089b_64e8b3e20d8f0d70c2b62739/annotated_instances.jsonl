Here\u2019s what I would do, if I were making crab curry.  First, I would get some fresh crab meat.  If you can\u2019t get fresh crab meat, you can substitute canned crab meat, but fresh is better.  Then I would heat up a large skillet, and add a tablespoon or two of oil.  Then I\u2019d add some chopped onion, and saut\u00e9 it until it\u2019s soft.
