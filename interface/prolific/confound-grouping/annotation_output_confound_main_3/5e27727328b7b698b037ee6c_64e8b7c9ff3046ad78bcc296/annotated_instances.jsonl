To do this, go to your iPhone's settings, and then select the airplane mode option.\n\nOnce airplane mode is turned on, you'll need to connect to the in-flight wifi network. The airline should provide you with the name and password for the network.\n\nOnce you're connected to the in-flight wifi network, you can open up your web browser and start browsing the internet.\n\nIt's important to note that using in-flight wifi can be expensive, so make sure to check with the airline before you connect."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 77, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5e27727328b7b698b037ee6c_64e8b7c9ff3046ad78bcc296", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "1", "complexity_b": "3", "assertive_a": "1", "assertive_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 1s "}}
