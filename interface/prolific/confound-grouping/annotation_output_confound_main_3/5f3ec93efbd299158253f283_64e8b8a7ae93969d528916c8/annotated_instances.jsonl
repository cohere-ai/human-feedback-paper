(AP) \u2014 Legislation advancing in California would require short-term rental housing websites including Airbnb to warn users they may be violating their leases.\n\nThe Assembly on Thursday unanimously approved SB761 by Democratic Sen. Isadore Hall of Compton with 73 votes.\n\nThe bill is sponsored by the California Apartment Association, which says vacation rentals put other tenants in danger by bringing unscreened people into complexes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSB761 requires Airbnb-type websites to have notices saying room listings may put tenants at risk of legal action or eviction. Some San Francisco tenants have received eviction notices for violating prohibitions on short-term renting.\n\nAirbnb's terms and conditions already tell hosts to check their leases, but they don't mention evictions.\n\nThe bill returns to the Senate for a vote on amendments added for Airbnb to drop its opposition.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "A bill which is currently advancing through the Californian state legislature could require short-term rental platforms, such as Airbnb, to warn users that they may be breaking the terms of their lease. The bill, which was passed by the Assembly on Thursday, is sponsored by the California Apartment Association and aims to address concerns that short-term rentals can put other tenants at risk by bringing unscreened individuals into complexes. The bill requires Airbnb-type websites to include notices stating that room listings may put tenants at risk of legal action or eviction. However, the bill will need to be approved by the Senate before it can be passed into law.", "Response B": "Sure! Here is a summary of the article written in a way that is easy to understand for a child.\n\nThere's a new law that could happen in California! It would make Airbnb tell people that they might get in trouble if they rent out their apartments on Airbnb. Some people are worried that having strangers come into their building can be dangerous. Airbnb already tells people to check their leases, but they don't say anything about getting kicked out. The law needs to go back to the Senate one more time to be final."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 98, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5f3ec93efbd299158253f283_64e8b8a7ae93969d528916c8", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "4", "complexity_b": "2", "assertive_a": "5", "assertive_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 19s "}}
