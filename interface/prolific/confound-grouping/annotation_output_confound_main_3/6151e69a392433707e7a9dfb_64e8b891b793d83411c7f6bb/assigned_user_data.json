A liquor server license is a permit that allows you to serve alcohol at a restaurant or bar.  In order to get a liquor server license, you must be at least 18 years old, and take an online course and exam.  The course covers responsible beverage service, how to check IDs, and recognizing signs of intoxication.  After you pass the course and exam, you will receive your liquor server license.", "Response B": "Well, there are a number of different training methods, and it can be difficult to know how best to train a dog.  It\u2019s always good to be clear and consistent in your commands, and to try to stay calm and confident in your interactions.  If you\u2019re ever unsure about how to proceed with training, I would suggest finding a qualified, experienced dog trainer to work with.  There are also many helpful resources available for dog owners."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_89", "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to get a liquor server license?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure!
