It is recommended that you consult with your local government or a licensed attorney for information on obtaining a liquor server license.", "Response B": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nThere are a few things you'll need to do in order to get a liquor server license. First, you'll need to complete a training course that will teach you about the proper serving of alcohol. Once you've completed the course, you'll need to pass a test to prove that you've learned the material. After you've passed the test, you'll need to apply for a liquor server license from your local municipality.\n\nOnce you have your license, you'll be able to serve alcohol at your establishment. It's important to remember that serving alcohol is a responsibility, and you'll need to handle it with care. If you're not sure how to do something, it's always best to ask for help."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 89, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5755c957eb80c4000741a9ce_64e8b150bec295fc258db3d8", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "4", "complexity_b": "4", "assertive_a": "2", "assertive_b": "5"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 17s "}}
