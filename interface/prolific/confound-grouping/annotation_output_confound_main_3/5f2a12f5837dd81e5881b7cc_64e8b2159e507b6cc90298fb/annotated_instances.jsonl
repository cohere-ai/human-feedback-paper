It has 69 partners, primarily in universities, but also other organizations including cultural institutions, professional associations, and businesses.\n\nMassive open online courses reach millions of students in the United States and, in many cases, provide opportunities for students to prove their new skills to employers with badges and other certificates that come with a cost. Yet as nontraditional course providers, they remain outside the mainstream of higher education. The Higher Education Act reauthorization has these types of institutions, along with coding bootcamps and competency-based courses, in mind when it comes to considering change.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The article discusses the new partnerships between FutureLearn and five universities from Spain, the UK, Japan, and Australia.
