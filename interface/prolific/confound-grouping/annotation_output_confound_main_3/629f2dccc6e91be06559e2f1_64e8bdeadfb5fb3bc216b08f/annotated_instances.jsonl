It seems like the Los Angeles City Council is considering whether to allow ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft to pick up passengers at LAX airport. The Airport Commission has already announced a plan to permit this, but some City Council members are pushing for more stringent regulations.\n\nThere are concerns about safety and accessibility for passengers with disabilities, and some Council members want to see ride-sharing companies regulated in the same way as taxis before they're allowed at LAX. However, it's not clear if there is widespread support for scrapping the plan, and the vote this week will only determine if there will be a hearing and discussion on the matter later this year.\n\nUber and Lyft are still moving forward with their applications for permits, and if the City Council doesn't veto the Airport Commission's decision, they could start picking up passengers at the airport by September. It's a complex issue, and I'm not sure what the outcome will be."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_92", "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "629f2dccc6e91be06559e2f1_64e8bdeadfb5fb3bc216b08f", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "3", "complexity_b": "3", "assertive_a": "5", "assertive_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 39s "}}
