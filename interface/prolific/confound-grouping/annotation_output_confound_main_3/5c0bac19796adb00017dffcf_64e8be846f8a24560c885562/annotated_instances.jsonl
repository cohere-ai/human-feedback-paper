{"id": "125", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Through a collaboration between the University of Edinburgh's Li-FI R&D Centre and a university offshoot company called pureLiFi Ltd, the past four years have brought light-powered Internet connectivity out of the theoretical stage and into a tangible Li-Fi router. The real-world applications for Li-Fi connectivity could revolutionize the way much of the world gets online. The R&D team bringing Li-Fi to the real world expects that solar homes, consumer gadgets, and Internet of things devices will all be able to absorb power and receive data simultaneously with a Li-Fi system in place.\n\nThe Li-Fi prototype relies on solar energy to power Internet connections so that an LED light source paired with a solar panel becomes a fully functional transmitter and receiver system for high speed, secure data transfer. Instead of relying on hardwired cables or radio waves that are easily interrupted, Li-Fi uses the nearly undetectable flicker of an LED light to transmit data.\n\nLi-Fi is much faster than most standard Wi-Fi connections, and, perhaps most importantly, provides a connection that is significantly more secure. Because Li-Fi relies on light to transmit data, you have to be in the room with your device and the Li-Fi router in order to get connected. That would preclude strangers or literal outsiders from piggy-backing on your connection or eavesdropping on your online activity.\n\nBeyond the widespread Internet access that Li-Fi could help provide around the world, the technology also has applications for reliable systems like smart city networks and Internet of Things connectivity in the smart homes of the future.\n\n\"The wider opportunity is to transform global communications by speeding up the process of bringing Internet and other data communication functionality to remote and poorer regions in a way not previously thought achievable due to lack of infrastructure and investment,\" said Tom Higgison, Edinburgh Research & Innovation's IP Project Manager. Edinburgh Research & Innovation is the commercial branch of the technological developments accomplished on the University side, and they have announced they are looking for industrial partners to help bring Li-Fi routers to a more mainstream audience.\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Sure! Here is a summary of the provided text:\n\nLi-Fi, a technology that harnesses the power of light to transmit internet connectivity, has been brought out of the theoretical stage and into a tangible router thanks to a collaboration between the University of Edinburgh's Li-Fi R&D Centre and pureLiFi Ltd, a university offshoot company. The technology uses solar energy to power internet connections, making it faster and more secure than traditional Wi-Fi. Li-Fi has applications in smart city networks, smart homes, and internet access in remote regions. The technology is looking for industrial partners to bring Li-Fi routers to a more mainstream audience.\n\nWould you like me to add anything else to the summary?", "Response B": "Researchers at the University of Edinburgh's Li-Fi R&D Centre and PureLiFi Ltd have developed a light-powered Internet router that is significantly faster and more secure than Wi-Fi. The prototype router uses solar energy to power Internet connections, with an LED light source paired with a solar panel to transmit and receive data. The researchers say the technology has wide-ranging applications, including providing reliable Internet connections in remote and poorer regions, and will transform global communications by speeding up the process of bringing Internet and other data communication functionality to remote and poorer regions in a way not previously thought achievable due to lack of infrastructure and investment."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 81, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5c0bac19796adb00017dffcf_64e8be846f8a24560c885562", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "3", "complexity_b": "2", "assertive_a": "3", "assertive_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 18s "}}
