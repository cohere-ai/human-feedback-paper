This is a major step forward in decommissioning the plant and paves the way for continued progress. The operation was completed after several months of planning and is expected to last until the second half of 2021, with decommissioning efforts overall expected to last several decades. The announcement comes several days after the government said compensation costs from the disaster are expected to be more than $57 billion.", "Response B": "Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) has completed a \"major step forward\" in decommissioning the Fukushima nuclear plant, removing a 20-ton piece of rubble from Reactor 3. The debris was a fuel handling machine, which was destroyed in March 2011 when a tsunami sparked a meltdown at the plant. This was the first time the company has used cranes to remove debris from the plant, and is considered a significant step towards clearing the highly radioactive spent fuel rods from the cooling pool. The process is expected to take until the second half of 2021, but the decommissioning process is expected to last some four decades. Tepco's Chief Decommissioning Officer Naohiro Masuda said: \"It paves the way for continued progress and is a milestone in reducing the risk of removing spent fuel assemblies.\""}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 77, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6404f184dffe93798dca0f5f_64e8b932387990b81b96d7fc", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "5", "complexity_b": "5", "assertive_a": "5", "assertive_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 12s "}}
