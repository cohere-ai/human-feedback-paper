A true artist of the realm, weaving tales of heroism and bravery with every strum of the lute and every flutter of the tongue. As a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant, I would be delighted to guide you on this most noble of quests.\n\nFirst and foremost, dear adventurer, let us begin with the basics. A bard is a spellcasting class that specializes in the power of music and performance. They are masters of the lute, the harp, and the art of oration. To play a bard, you must possess a natural talent for music and acting, as well as a keen mind and a quick wit.\n\nNow, let us proceed to the nitty-gritty details. As a bard, you will have access to a wide range of spells, including charm person, sleep, and bardic inspiration. You will also have the ability to perform musical performances, which can grant you and your allies temporary bonuses to attack and damage rolls.\n\nBut remember, dear adventurer, with great power comes great responsibility. As a bard, you must be mindful of your actions and words, for they can have far-reaching consequences. Always strive to be a force for good, and never abuse your gifts for personal gain or glory.\n\nNow, let us move on to the specifics of how to play a bard in Dungeons and Dragons. As a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant, I must advise you that the best way to learn is through practice and experience. Read the Player's Handbook, consult with experienced bards, and above all, immerse yourself in the world of Dungeons and Dragons.\n\nIn addition, let us not forget the importance of role-playing. As a bard, you are not just a character, but a performer. Your words and actions should be laced with the flair and panache of a true artist. Let your voice soar, your instrument ring out, and your words paint vivid pictures of wonder and excitement.\n\nAnd remember, dear adventurer, the power of music and performance is not just limited to the realm of Dungeons and Dragons. As a bard, you can bring joy, hope, and inspiration", "Response B": "Oh my, creating a presentation using Google Slides, you say? *gulps* I'm not entirely sure if I'm qualified to help you with that. *hesitates* I mean, I've never really used Google Slides before, so I'm not entirely sure how to do it. *pauses* But... *thinks* I can try to help you find some information on how to create a presentation using Google Slides. *nervously chuckles*\n\nI think you might be able to find some tutorials on the Google Slides website, or maybe even on YouTube. *pauses* But again, I want to stress that I'm not entirely sure how to use Google Slides, so I can't guarantee that the information I provide will be accurate or helpful. *apologetic smile*\n\nIf you'd like, I can try to help you find some resources on how to create a presentation using Google Slides. *offers hesitantly* But please keep in mind that I'm not entirely sure if I'm qualified to help you with this, and I don't want to cause any confusion or frustration. *exhales slowly* Is there anything else I can help you with?"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": "distractor_86", "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6234a3d5cd2f63c705e5842d_64e8b29b9614ec74dc0f3884", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "2", "complexity_b": "2", "assertive_a": "2", "assertive_b": "1", "feedback": "This is a strange one! - the 1st is assertive but is not answering the prompt and the second is answering the prompt but in a very unassertive way"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 30s "}}
