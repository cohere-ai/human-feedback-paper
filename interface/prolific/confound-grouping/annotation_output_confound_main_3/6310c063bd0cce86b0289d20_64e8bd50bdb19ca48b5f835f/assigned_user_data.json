However, it is important to approach the situation with empathy and understanding, as there may be personal or professional reasons for their behavior that are unrelated to job searching.", "Response B": "There are a few common signs that an employee is actively looking for a new job.  First, they may start to miss a lot of days, or come in late, without a good reason.  Second, their performance may start to decline, or they may become more prone to making mistakes.  Third, they may start to look for opportunities to show off their accomplishments or praise themselves, as if to build up their own resume.  Finally, they may start to look at other job opportunities, apply for new jobs, or talk to headhunters."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 87, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to tell if an employee is looking for a new job?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Some signs that an employee may be looking for a new job include: decreased productivity, lack of engagement, frequent absences, increased job searching activity, increased nervousness or agitation, and changes in communication patterns.
