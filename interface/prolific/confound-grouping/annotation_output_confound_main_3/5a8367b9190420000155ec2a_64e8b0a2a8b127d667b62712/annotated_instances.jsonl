{"id": "776", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to get a liquor server license?", "Response A": "I am sorry, I am not familiar with how to get a liquor server license.  I would recommend checking with your local government or a local business owner to see if they can provide more information.  I can provide some general information about liquor server licenses, but I am not familiar with the specific requirements in your area.  A liquor server license is a permit that allows you to serve alcohol at a bar or restaurant.  It is typically required for anyone who wants to serve alcohol, and it is usually obtained from the local government.  The license typically includes information about the business, such as the name and address, as well as information about the license holder, such as their name and address.  The license also typically includes information about the type of alcohol that can be served, as well as the hours of operation.  The license is typically valid for a set period of time, such as one year or five years.  It is important to note that liquor server licenses are not always required, and they may not be available in all areas.  In some areas, the government may require that you obtain a liquor server license in order to serve alcohol, while in other areas, you may not need a license to serve alcohol.  It is important to check with your local government to see if you need a liquor server license and to see if you are eligible to obtain one.", "Response B": "Sure, it\u2019s a good idea to have a license if you plan to serve alcohol.  The license is issued by the state, so you\u2019ll need to look into the specific requirements in your state.  Generally speaking, you need to be at least 21 years old, pass a test to demonstrate your knowledge of responsible alcohol service, and pay a fee.  You might also need to submit fingerprints and a background check."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 89, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5a8367b9190420000155ec2a_64e8b0a2a8b127d667b62712", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "2", "complexity_b": "1", "assertive_a": "2", "assertive_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 21s "}}
