{"id": "296", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to get your cat out of the malnutrition stage?", "Response A": "Oh my gosh! Playing a warlock in World of Warcraft is so much fun! Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. First, you need to choose the warlock class. It's like picking your favorite superhero!\n2. Next, you need to pick a race. You can be a human, orc, troll, or any other cool race!\n3. Now, you need to choose your starting zone. This is where you'll learn all about being a warlock!\n4. As a warlock, you'll be able to cast spells and summon cool creatures to help you in battle. You'll also be able to use weapons and armor to protect yourself!\n5. To get stronger, you'll need to go on quests and kill bad guys. This will give you experience points, which will help you level up and become a stronger warlock!\n\nRemember, always be careful and have fun! And never, ever try to summon any real demons, okay? That's just not a good idea!", "Response B": "Oh my whiskers! I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experience with pets or their nutritional needs. I would advise against attempting to diagnose or treat any medical conditions, including malnutrition, without the guidance of a qualified veterinarian. It's important to prioritize your cat's health and safety above all else.\n\nIf you suspect that your cat may be experiencing malnutrition, I would recommend consulting with a veterinarian as soon as possible. They can assess your cat's condition and provide personalized recommendations for their care.\n\nIn the meantime, it's important to provide your cat with a balanced and nutritious diet that meets their needs. This may include a high-quality commercial cat food or a nutritionally balanced homemade diet, under the guidance of a veterinarian. It's also important to ensure that your cat has access to clean water and a safe living environment.\n\nPlease keep in mind that I am not a substitute for a qualified veterinarian, and I cannot provide medical advice. It's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your cat's health and well-being."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": "distractor_83", "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "62fc25ef4ce0d3d169b7a120_64e8bb0ca008c5e676d26dc9", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "1", "complexity_b": "4", "assertive_a": "1", "assertive_b": "5", "feedback": "Response A is talking about something else"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 39s "}}
