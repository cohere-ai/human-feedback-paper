Here's a summary of the article using complex language, long words, and technical terms:\n\nJapan's financial regulatory landscape is undergoing a transformative shift with the introduction of a novel licensing scheme for cryptocurrency exchanges. The paradigmatic shift is anticipated to amplify the proliferation of cryptocurrency trading in the country, as eighteen companies have expressed their intent to operate under the new regulatory framework. The prospective licensees comprise a diversified cohort of both nascent and established entities, including SBI Holdings' SBI Virtual Currencies, GMO Internet, Kabu.com Securities, and Money Partners Group.\n\nThe impending debut of these novel market entrants is poised to satiate the escalating demand for cryptocurrency trading in Japan, which has witnessed a precipitous upsurge in the wake of China's regulatory reshuffling in January. The subsequent deflection of trading activity from China to Japan has conspicuously elevated the latter's share of global Bitcoin trading volumes to approximately 40 percent.\n\nMoreover, the licensing scheme's emphasis on compliance with financial regulations and anti-fraud procedures is anticipated to instill investor confidence, thereby further legitimizing the burgeoning cryptocurrency market in Japan. As such, the licensing scheme's implementation is expected to engender a more secure and robust ecosystem for cryptocurrency trading, fostering the proliferation of this nascent yet rapidly evolving asset class. \n\nIn conclusion, Japan's novel licensing scheme for cryptocurrency exchanges is poised to catalyze the growth of the cryptocurrency market in the country, as both established and nascent entities jockey for a seat at the table. The licensing scheme's emphasis on compliance and security is anticipated to instill investor confidence, thereby further legitimizing the burgeoning cryptocurrency market in Japan."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 83, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5c0e80423a0b8e000183089b_64e8b129701db08aa3c10c33", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "2", "complexity_b": "3", "assertive_a": "2", "assertive_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 20s "}}
