The bank is expecting a claim will be filed later this week.\n\nIt is understood CBA has no interest in settling with the regulator so long as it is required to provide an admission of unconscionable conduct. All of the banks are concerned such as admission will expose them to damages claims through class actions, after plaintiff law firm Maurice Blackburn said last month it is investigating such actions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Federal Court has set a provisional trial date for the cases of August 1 next year.\n\nTried together\n\nIn a case management hearing last month, Federal Court judge Jonathan Beach pushed back on ASIC's request for the case against ANZ to be heard first, which could have created a legal precedent to put pressure on the other banks to settle.\n\nRather, Justice Beach said his \"provisional view\" is that the three cases be tried together. He wants all the common issues vented at the first stage, and then to hear all the ANZ-specific issues, then the Westpac-specific issues and then the NAB-specific issues.\n\n\"I accept that in terms of the detail of some of the allegations and transactions there is still more to be disclosed by ASIC and to be looked at by each of the three banks, but it seems to be in relation to the matters of principle that I think all parties should have a fairly reasonable idea of what those issues of principle are at the moment,\" the judge said.\n\nAnother case management hearing is due to be held on August 22.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a series of orders on Monday barring some imports of cotton, apparel, hair products, computer parts and other goods from China's Xinjiang region due to the government's \"illicit, inhumane, and exploitative practices of forced labor.\" The Trump administration is taking an increasingly aggressive approach to human rights abuses in Xinjiang, where the Chinese government is engaged in a sweeping campaign of demographic and cultural genocide against Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities. The CBP orders apply to the following imports from the Xinjiang region: all products made with labor from the Lop County No. 4 Vocational Skills Education and Training Center in Xinjiang; hair products made in the Lop County Hair Product Industrial Park in Xinjiang; apparel produced by Yili Zhuowan Garment Manufacturing Co., Ltd. and Baoding LYSZD Trade and Business Co., Ltd in Xinjiang; cotton produced and processed by Xinjiang Junggar Cotton and Linen Co., Ltd. in Xinjiang; computer parts made by Hefei Bitland Information Technology Co., Ltd. in Anhui. President Trump told Axios in June that he previously held off on sanctioning officials and entities involved in the detention camps because doing so would have interfered with his trade deal with Beijing. In July, the U.S. sanctioned Chinese Communist Party officials, the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) for their role in constructing and operating massive \"re-education\" camps, where over 1 million Uighurs have been detained. The XPCC, a paramilitary organization, is involved in the production of one-third of China's cotton, and in 2014, XPCC-controlled interests comprised 17% of Xinjiang's economy.", "Response B": "ASIC has filed claims of market manipulation and unconscionable conduct against three of Australia's big four banks, with allegations that they engaged in a scheme to manipulate the bank bill swap rate.
