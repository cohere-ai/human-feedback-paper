First, the recent rains in the Plains have helped to improve the condition of the crop, and this could lead to a better yield. Second, the current drought in the region has caused concern for the future of the crop, and this could lead to a higher price. Finally, the current open enrollment season for health insurance will be a difficult one for workers, and this could lead to a higher demand for wheat as a cash flow option.", "Response B": "The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at its December meeting to combat inflation, but the key question is whether it will follow that up with another hike in February, according to a survey of economists by Bloomberg. The survey found that the median forecast is for four rate increases next year, but there is a wide range of opinions, from three to seven increases, with three economists saying there won't be any hikes. The survey also found that economists have raised their inflation expectations for next year, with the median forecast now at 3.5% from 2.9% in September."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 85, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6234a7fc493d026318784c23_64e8aeea819d99961b8db3eb", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "2", "complexity_b": "3", "assertive_a": "3", "assertive_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 19s "}}
