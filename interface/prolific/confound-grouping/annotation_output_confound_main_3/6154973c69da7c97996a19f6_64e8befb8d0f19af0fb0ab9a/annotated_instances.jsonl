Some drivers - brought over from poorer countries by lorry firms based in Eastern Europe - say their salary is less than three pounds an hour...EU rules state that a driver posted temporarily away from home should be ''guaranteed'' the host nation's ''minimum rates of pay'' and conditions. But companies can exploit loopholes in the law...According to EU law, drivers must take 45 hours weekly rest away from their cabs, but governments have been slow to enforce it...It is clear this way of treating drivers is widespread. It is not just within the Ikea supply chain, but also in those of several other big, household names...Legal action is now being taken against some of Ikea's contractors. In the Netherlands last month, a court ruled that Brinkman - which delivers Ikea flowers to the UK and Scandinavia - was breaking the law. The court found that drivers' pay was \"not consistent\" with Dutch wages law. The judge described conditions for drivers as an \"inhumane state of affairs'', and contrary to EU law...Ikea said it takes what drivers have told the BBC \"very seriously'' and are \"saddened by the testimonies\". It said it puts ''strict demands'' on its suppliers concerning wages, working conditions and following applicable legislation, and audits them regularly to check compliance...\n\n(Photo credit: BBC News)\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Companies can exploit loopholes in EU law on HGV drivers' rights, according to the BBC. The European Union requires that drivers must take 45 hours of rest away from their cabs each week, but governments have been slow to enforce the law. Lorry drivers moving goods in Western Europe for Ikea and other retailers are living out of their cabs for months at a time. Some drivers - brought over from poorer countries by lorry firms based in Eastern Europe - say their salary is less than three pounds an hour.", "Response B": "IKEA works with many companies to supply its stores. Some of these companies are based in Eastern Europe and bring drivers from poorer countries to Western Europe, where they live in their trucks for months. These drivers are paid very little, much less than they would be paid in Western Europe. This is illegal, but the companies are exploiting loopholes in the law. IKEA says it is sad about what the drivers have told the BBC and puts strict demands on its suppliers, but some of IKEA's contractors have been found to be breaking the law."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 89, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6154973c69da7c97996a19f6_64e8befb8d0f19af0fb0ab9a", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "3", "complexity_b": "2", "assertive_a": "3", "assertive_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 3s "}}
