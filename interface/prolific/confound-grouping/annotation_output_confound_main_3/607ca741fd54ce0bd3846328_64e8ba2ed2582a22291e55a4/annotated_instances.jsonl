But companies can exploit loopholes in the law...According to EU law, drivers must take 45 hours weekly rest away from their cabs, but governments have been slow to enforce it...It is clear this way of treating drivers is widespread. It is not just within the Ikea supply chain, but also in those of several other big, household names...Legal action is now being taken against some of Ikea's contractors. In the Netherlands last month, a court ruled that Brinkman - which delivers Ikea flowers to the UK and Scandinavia - was breaking the law. The court found that drivers' pay was \"not consistent\" with Dutch wages law. The judge described conditions for drivers as an \"inhumane state of affairs'', and contrary to EU law...Ikea said it takes what drivers have told the BBC \"very seriously'' and are \"saddened by the testimonies\".
