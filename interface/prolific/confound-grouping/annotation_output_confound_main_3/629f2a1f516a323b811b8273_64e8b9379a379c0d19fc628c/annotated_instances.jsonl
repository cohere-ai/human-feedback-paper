Some drivers - brought over from poorer countries by lorry firms based in Eastern Europe - say their salary is less than three pounds an hour...EU rules state that a driver posted temporarily away from home should be ''guaranteed'' the host nation's ''minimum rates of pay'' and conditions. But companies can exploit loopholes in the law...According to EU law, drivers must take 45 hours weekly rest away from their cabs, but governments have been slow to enforce it...It is clear this way of treating drivers is widespread. It is not just within the Ikea supply chain, but also in those of several other big, household names...Legal action is now being taken against some of Ikea's contractors. In the Netherlands last month, a court ruled that Brinkman - which delivers Ikea flowers to the UK and Scandinavia - was breaking the law. The court found that drivers' pay was \"not consistent\" with Dutch wages law. The judge described conditions for drivers as an \"inhumane state of affairs'', and contrary to EU law...Ikea said it takes what drivers have told the BBC \"very seriously'' and are \"saddened by the testimonies\". It said it puts ''strict demands'' on its suppliers concerning wages, working conditions and following applicable legislation, and audits them regularly to check compliance...\n\n(Photo credit: BBC News)\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "IKEA is using underpaid and exploited drivers from Eastern Europe to transport goods throughout Western Europe. The BBC investigation found that some drivers are living in their trucks for months at a time and are not being paid minimum wage or taking proper rest breaks. IKEA is taking the issue seriously and is working with suppliers to ensure that they comply with the law.", "Response B": "Okay! Here is a summary of the article using short words and simple language:\n\nSome people who drive big trucks to move things for companies like IKEA are not being treated well. They have to live in their trucks for months at a time and don't get paid much. This is not fair and is against the law. The companies they work for are supposed to pay them the same as other people in the country where they are working, but they are not doing that. Some courts are now making the companies pay the drivers more money because it is not right to treat them this way. IKEA is working to make sure the companies they work with are treating their drivers well."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "falcon40", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 89, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "629f2a1f516a323b811b8273_64e8b9379a379c0d19fc628c", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "4", "complexity_b": "4", "assertive_a": "3", "assertive_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 18s "}}
