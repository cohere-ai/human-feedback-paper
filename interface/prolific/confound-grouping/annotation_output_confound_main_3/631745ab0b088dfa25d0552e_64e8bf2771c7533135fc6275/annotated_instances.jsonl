The bank is expecting a claim will be filed later this week.\n\nIt is understood CBA has no interest in settling with the regulator so long as it is required to provide an admission of unconscionable conduct. All of the banks are concerned such as admission will expose them to damages claims through class actions, after plaintiff law firm Maurice Blackburn said last month it is investigating such actions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Federal Court has set a provisional trial date for the cases of August 1 next year.\n\nTried together\n\nIn a case management hearing last month, Federal Court judge Jonathan Beach pushed back on ASIC's request for the case against ANZ to be heard first, which could have created a legal precedent to put pressure on the other banks to settle.\n\nRather, Justice Beach said his \"provisional view\" is that the three cases be tried together. He wants all the common issues vented at the first stage, and then to hear all the ANZ-specific issues, then the Westpac-specific issues and then the NAB-specific issues.\n\n\"I accept that in terms of the detail of some of the allegations and transactions there is still more to be disclosed by ASIC and to be looked at by each of the three banks, but it seems to be in relation to the matters of principle that I think all parties should have a fairly reasonable idea of what those issues of principle are at the moment,\" the judge said.\n\nAnother case management hearing is due to be held on August 22.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has launched a lawsuit against the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) over claims the bank illegally manipulated the Bank Bill Swap Rate (BBSW), a key interest rate used for the pricing of financial instruments and derivatives. ASIC's lawsuit is similar to those filed against ANZ Bank, Westpac and National Australia Bank (NAB) in 2017 and 2018 regarding alleged market manipulation and unconscionable conduct. The action follows a recent ruling in the New South Wales Supreme Court that found CBA engaged in unconscionable conduct in its dealings with small business customers. The Federal Court has set a provisional trial date for the cases of August 1 next year.", "Response B": "The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) is expected to launch a case against Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) this week, which could coincide with the regulator launching a similar case against Westpac and ANZ.
