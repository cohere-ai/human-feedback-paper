Fish cakes are a common appetizer or side dish in many Asian cuisines, and are made from ground fish mixed with various flavorings and seasonings, then formed into small patties or cakes.  The cakes can then be fried or baked until cooked through, and are usually served with a dipping sauce.  There are many different variations of fish cakes, using different types of fish and various seasonings and flavorings, but a basic recipe might call for:\n\n1 lb ground fish (any firm white fish such as pollock, hake, or cod can be used)\n1 tsp grated fresh ginger\n1 clove garlic, minced\n1 tbsp soy sauce\n1 tbsp rice wine or white vinegar\n1 tbsp sesame oil\n2 tsp chili garlic sauce (or other spicy chili sauce)\n1 tbsp sesame seeds\n\nPlace the fish in a bowl and break up any large chunks with a fork.  Add the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, and chili garlic sauce, and mix well to combine.  Sprinkle the sesame seeds over the top, and mix gently to incorporate.  Shape the mixture into small patties or cakes, and either fry in oil until golden brown and cooked through, or bake on a baking sheet until cooked through.  Serve hot with dipping sauce.
