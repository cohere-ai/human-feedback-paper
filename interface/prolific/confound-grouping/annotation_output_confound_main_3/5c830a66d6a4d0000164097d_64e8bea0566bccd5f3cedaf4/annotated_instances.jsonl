{"id": "123", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to rip mp3s from spotify?", "Response A": "Sure, I can help you with that! To rip mp3s from Spotify, you can use a program called \"Spotify Music Downloader\" or \"Spotify ripper.\" These programs will allow you to download and convert your Spotify music to mp3 format.\n\nOnce you have downloaded and installed one of these programs, you can open it and connect to your Spotify account. Then, you can search for the music you want to rip and select the songs you want to download. The program will then download and convert the music to mp3 format.\n\nAfter the music has been downloaded and converted, you can find it in the program's \"Downloaded\" folder. You can then move the music to your computer's \"Music\" folder and play it on your music player.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.", "Response B": "I don't know if you would describe it as ripping, but you could use a Spotify app to download the tracks locally, and then convert them to mp3."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 80, "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5c830a66d6a4d0000164097d_64e8bea0566bccd5f3cedaf4", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "2", "complexity_b": "1", "assertive_a": "5", "assertive_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 26s "}}
