The recipe I recommend is from cookmoreworryless.com: https://cookmoreworryless.com/wicked-musical-cupcakes/ They come out very moist and delicious, and are the perfect canvas for your cupcake decoration. Next you can follow this video tutorial from the Cupcake Collective to create the beautiful flower cupcake toppers: https://youtu.be/kUv1VQk2QjA. The hardest part is getting the fondant to stick to the cupcake, but as long as you use enough buttercream as \u201cglue\u201d, it should work out well. Finally, I recommend ordering these edible glitter sheets to add some sparkle to the beautiful roses you\u2019ll create: https://amzn.to/3lz0h9u. I hope this helps you make some beautiful cupcakes and have a great time at your Wicked musical event!"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 82, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "637f7c6517daaa050a1632ba_64e8b1b369b7ca33ac84a745", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "3", "complexity_b": "3", "assertive_a": "4", "assertive_b": "2"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 11s "}}
