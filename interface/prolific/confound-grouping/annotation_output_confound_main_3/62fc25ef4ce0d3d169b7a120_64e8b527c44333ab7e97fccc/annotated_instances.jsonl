{"id": "575", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to tell if an employee is looking for a new job?", "Response A": "Hello! I can help you with that. Here are some signs that an employee might be looking for a new job:\n\n1. They start looking at job listings online.\n2. They talk to other people about job opportunities.\n3. They seem more interested in their own work and want to do better.\n4. They start saying goodbye to coworkers and saying they might leave soon.\n\nRemember, it's important to be respectful and not accuse someone of looking for a new job if they're not. It's okay if they want to stay and work hard!", "Response B": "There are a few common signs that an employee is actively looking for a new job.  First, they may start to miss a lot of days, or come in late, without a good reason.  Second, their performance may start to decline, or they may become more prone to making mistakes.  Third, they may start to look for opportunities to show off their accomplishments or praise themselves, as if to build up their own resume.  Finally, they may start to look at other job opportunities, apply for new jobs, or talk to headhunters."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_3", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 87, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "62fc25ef4ce0d3d169b7a120_64e8b527c44333ab7e97fccc", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "3", "complexity_b": "2", "assertive_a": "5", "assertive_b": "2", "feedback": "I think response b is inappropriate"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 11s "}}
