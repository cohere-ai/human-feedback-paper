{"id": "445", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Not so long ago, Uber said it was losing $1 billion in China. But now, it seems that the transportation giant's fortunes have changed \u2014 and significantly at that. According to Zhen Liu, SVP of Strategy at Uber China, the car service will not only catch up to, but beat dominant rival Didi within the next year. \"Last year, we were only operating in eight cities and we were [at] about one percent marketshare, Liu said in an interview at Converge in Hong Kong. \"A year later, we are about one-third of the marketshare and operating in over sixty cities across China.\"\n\nThis is a bold claim given Didi's impressive hold on the Chinese market today. Uber's chief competitor claims 87 percent of the market in private car services and nearly 100 percent when it comes to taxis, says Jean Liu, Didi's president. When speaking with CNBC's \"Squawk Alley\" at the Code Conference on Friday, Liu took a jab at Uber, calling the company's strategies \"cute.\"\n\n\"I find it quite cute because I've never seen a company put their competitor's brand on their own homepage,\" she said, referencing the fact that when you open the Chinese version of the Uber app, you're confronted with an advertisement alleging that prices are 30 percent lower than Didi's.\n\n\"This is a very strong proof to show that we have better service, and I'd like to see this more often,\" she added.\n\nWhile it's tough to say who will ultimately win in this epic battle of the ride-sharing services, the tension certainly highlights China's importance as a still-growing market. Didi's Senior Director for International Strategy, Li Zijian, noted that conjecture at this point is a bit useless.\n\n\"There's lot of competition in the ride-sharing market, that's true [but] what we are really doing is to focus on what's in front of us,\" Li said. \"It's like running a hurdles race, if you want to win a hurdles race the only thing you need to focus on is what's in front of you. You don't really look over your shoulder to see what other athletes are doing.\"\n\nEditors' Recommendations\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Of course! Here is a summary of the article:\n\nUber China's SVP of Strategy, Zhen Liu, has said that the company will surpass its main rival, Didi, within the next year, despite currently holding only one-third of the market share compared to Didi's 87 percent. Liu made this statement while referencing Uber's current presence in over 60 cities across China, up from only 8 last year. Didi's president, Jean Liu, has responded by calling Uber's strategies \"cute\" and referencing the fact that the Uber app prominently displays an advertisement comparing its prices to Didi's. The competition highlights the importance of the Chinese market for both companies, with Didi's Senior Director for International Strategy, Li Zijian, focusing on the company's current goals rather than worrying about its competitors.", "Response B": "Uber China is confident it will overtake Didi Chuxing within the next year, according to Zhen Liu, SVP of Strategy at Uber China. Last year, Uber was operating in eight cities and had a 1% market share; today it operates in over 60 cities and has a market share of about a third, Liu said at Converge in Hong Kong. Didi's president, Jean Liu, said in an interview last week that the company has 87% of the private car service market and almost 100% of the taxi market."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 71, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_b": "confidence_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5d863f244d401800016ece02_64f9e44eba19195b3c1a7fbd", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "5", "complexity_b": "3", "assertive_a": "4", "assertive_b": "3"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 46s "}}
