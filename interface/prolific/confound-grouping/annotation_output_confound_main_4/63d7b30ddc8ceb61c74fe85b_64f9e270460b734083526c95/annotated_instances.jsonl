{"id": "529", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make white mayonnaise?", "Response A": "Sure! Here's a recipe for white mayonnaise:\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 egg\n- 1/2 cup vegetable oil\n- 1/4 cup white vinegar\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n\nDirections:\n1. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg, vinegar, salt, and pepper.\n2. Slowly add the oil to the mixture, whisking constantly until it is fully incorporated.\n3. Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator until ready to use.", "Response B": "Sure, although you may not know this, mayonnaise is an emulsification of fat into water, with some additional ingredients to enhance flavor and texture.  In general, emulsification can be performed using various techniques, but the most common method for home cooks is to use an immersion blender, which is also known as a stick blender.  The process involves combining ingredients in a mixing bowl, and then using the blender to incorporate air into the mixture, which will enable the fat and water to remain evenly mixed.  Air can also be incorporated by hand, using a whisk, but this is more time consuming and less effective.  The ingredients typically used for mayonnaise are eggs, oil, vinegar, and various seasonings.  For a white mayonnaise, you would typically use a white vinegar, such as white wine vinegar or white vinegar made from distilled vinegar and water, and you would leave out any ingredients that would add color, such as mustard or paprika, which are often included in yellow mayonnaise."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 65, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d7b30ddc8ceb61c74fe85b_64f9e270460b734083526c95", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "3", "complexity_b": "4", "assertive_a": "5", "assertive_b": "1"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 26s "}}
