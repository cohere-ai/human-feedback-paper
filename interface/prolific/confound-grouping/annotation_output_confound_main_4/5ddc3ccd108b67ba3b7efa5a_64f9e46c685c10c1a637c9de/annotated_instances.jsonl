It's important to remember that everyone experiences teasing differently, and what may be considered harmless banter for one person may be deeply hurtful to another. \n\nIf you are experiencing verbal teasing, it may be helpful to consider the following strategies:\n\n- Try to understand the other person's perspective: It's possible that the person teasing you may not realize that their words are causing you harm.

Let them know what types of comments are acceptable and what types are not.\n- Seek support: It's okay to seek support from friends, family, or a mental health professional if you are feeling overwhelmed or upset by the teasing.\n- Practice self-care: Taking care of yourself is important in any situation, but especially when you are dealing with emotional stress.
