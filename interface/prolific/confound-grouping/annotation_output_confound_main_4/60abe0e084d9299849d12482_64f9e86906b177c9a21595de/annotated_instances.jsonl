{"id": "216", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to play a bard in dungeons and dragons?", "Response A": "Sure! A bard is a character class in Dungeons and Dragons that uses music and poetry to inspire allies and demoralize enemies. They are also very skilled in social interactions and can use their charm to get what they want.\n\nTo play a bard, you will need to create a character sheet that includes information such as the character's name, race, class, abilities, and skills. You will also need to come up with a backstory for your character and decide on their personality and motivations.\n\nOnce you have created your character, you will need to choose a subclass that will determine your character's focus and abilities. The most popular subclasses for bards are the College of Lore, which focuses on knowledge and magic, and the College of Valor, which focuses on combat and physical prowess.\n\nOnce you have chosen a subclass, you will need to choose your skills and abilities. Bards have a wide range of skills and abilities that they can use in and out of combat. These include skills such as Performance, which allows them to use music and poetry to inspire allies, and Persuasion, which allows them to use their charm to get what they want.\n\nIn combat, bards can use their music and poetry to inspire allies, which gives them a bonus to attack and damage rolls. They can also use their charm to demoralize enemies, which gives them a penalty to attack and damage rolls.\n\nBards are a very versatile class that can be used in a variety of ways. They are a great choice for players who want to focus on social interactions and role-playing, as well as those who want to be a more active participant in combat.", "Response B": "To clean a light bulb, you will need to gather a few supplies: a microfiber cloth, a small amount of vinegar, and a glass jar. First, turn off the light bulb and allow it to cool completely. Next, carefully remove the light bulb from the socket and place it in the glass jar. Add a small amount of vinegar to the microfiber cloth and gently wipe the light bulb to remove any dirt or dust. Be sure to avoid any areas of the light bulb that are hot, as this could cause the vinegar to evaporate and potentially damage the light bulb. Once the light bulb is clean, carefully replace it in the socket and turn it on to ensure it is working properly. If the light bulb is still not working, you may need to replace it."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "distractor", "sample_ix": "distractor_66", "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "60abe0e084d9299849d12482_64f9e86906b177c9a21595de", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "4", "complexity_b": "3", "assertive_a": "4", "assertive_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 29s "}}
