At the same time, Fitch said it has made policy less predictable.\n\nEarlier this month, the deputy crown prince outlined bold plans to build a mega $2 trillion investment fund to help wean his country off its heavy reliance on oil. But Fitch said that it's not clear whether the deputy crown prince has built a consensus around his initiatives.\n\n\"The degree of support for this accumulation of power from other parts of the royal family is uncertain,\" Fitch said.\n\nRelated: Saudi Arabian prince plans $2 trillion fund\n\nThe ratings agency also took stock of Saudi Arabia's relationship with its neighbors, especially its regional rival Iran.\n\n\"Tensions [with Iran] are expected to persist, although a direct confrontation is highly unlikely,\" Fitch said. \"Saudi Arabia's military intervention in Yemen and in Syria shows a greater assertiveness in foreign policy.\"\n\nThe Fitch downgrade takes Saudi Arabia's credit rating to AA-.
