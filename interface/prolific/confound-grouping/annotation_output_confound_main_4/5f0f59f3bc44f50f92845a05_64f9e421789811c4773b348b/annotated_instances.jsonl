Turn off your monitor: Before you start cleaning, make sure your monitor is turned off. Unplug the power cord from the back of the monitor to avoid any accidental power-ons.\n2. Use a soft cloth: Look for a soft, lint-free cloth that won't scratch your monitor's screen. A microfiber cloth is a good option. Avoid using paper towels or other abrasive materials that could scratch the screen.\n3. Dampen the cloth: Gently wet the cloth with distilled water. Do not use tap water, as it may contain minerals that can leave streaks or spots on the screen.\n4.

If you see any, repeat the cleaning process as needed.\n\nRemember to clean your monitor regularly to keep it in good condition and prevent dust and dirt from accumulating.
