Labor's policy on the sharing economy acknowledges the potential benefits of the sharing economy, while also acknowledging the need to protect consumers and ensure that everyone pays their fair share of tax and complies with relevant laws.  Labor's policy proposes a number of principles to guide regulation of the sharing economy, including a \"primary property is yours to share\" principle, which states that people should be free to participate in the sharing economy without facing heavy-handed regulation, and a \"zero tolerance\" approach to those who continue to flout Australian laws.  Labor's policy also emphasizes the need to ensure that everyone engaged in the sharing economy pays a fair share of tax and complies with relevant laws and regulations.  Finally, Labor's policy supports the sharing economy provided that wages and conditions are protected, and that sharing economy services are accessible to Australians with disabilities."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": 70, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "5bc10133904b2f000194b264_64f9e01415499359688db006", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "4", "complexity_b": "5", "assertive_a": "4", "assertive_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 19s "}}
