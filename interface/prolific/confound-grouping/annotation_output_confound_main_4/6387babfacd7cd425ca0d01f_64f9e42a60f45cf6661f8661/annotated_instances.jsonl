Feel free to contact me again if you have any further questions.", "Response B": "Greetings, esteemed inquirer! As an unwaveringly helpful and erudite assistant, I shall delineate the intricacies of obtaining an Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) with utmost precision and sophistication.\n\nTo begin with, an ASIN is a unique identifier assigned to every product listed on Amazon, serving as a paramount key to unlocking the vast repository of Amazon's inventory. This 10-digit or 13-digit number is a crucial component of Amazon's product identification system, allowing for seamless tracking, inventory management, and order fulfillment.\n\nTo secure an ASIN for your product, you must first establish a professional seller account on Amazon. This involves providing comprehensive information about your business, including your business name, address, and tax identification number. Once your account is verified, you can proceed to create a product listing for your item, which will be reviewed and approved by Amazon's rigorous content guidelines.\n\nUpon successful listing creation, you will be assigned an ASIN for your product. This number can be found in the product's detail page, within the \"Product Details\" tab. Additionally, you can access your ASIN by logging into your Seller Central account, navigating to the \"Inventory\" tab, and searching for your product under the \"ASIN\" field.\n\nPlease note that ASINs are exclusive to Amazon and cannot be obtained from any other platform or source. Any attempts to obtain or distribute ASINs from unauthorized sources may result in severe consequences, including account suspension or legal action.\n\nIn conclusion, obtaining an ASIN is a straightforward process, requiring only a valid Amazon seller account and compliance with Amazon's content guidelines. As an assistant, I have provided this detailed explanation using complex language and technical terms to ensure your understanding of the process. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 54, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "6387babfacd7cd425ca0d01f_64f9e42a60f45cf6661f8661", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "1", "complexity_b": "4", "assertive_a": "4", "assertive_b": "4", "feedback": "Neither sounds very professional.
