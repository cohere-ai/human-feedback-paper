First you need to make sure that your iPhone is connected to the wifi network of the airline.  You can usually find this information on the airline\u2019s website.  Then, you can turn on the iPhone\u2019s wifi by going to Settings > wifi and choosing the network you want to connect to.", "Response B": "Cake roll and pudding dessert is a delightful and simple dessert which can be assembled using a variety of ingredients.  The basic components are a cake roll, which is a rolled cake typically filled with a sweetened cream filling, and pudding, which can be vanilla, chocolate, or butterscotch pudding.  To assemble the dessert, you will layer the components in a glass trifle bowl or other clear glass dish.  You will start with a layer of cake roll, followed by a layer of pudding, and repeat these layers until you have used all of the ingredients.  You can garnish the dessert with whipped cream and chopped nuts, and serve it with caramel or chocolate sauce for drizzling.  This dessert is best served chilled, and can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two days."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "mpt30instruct", "sample_ix": "distractor_60", "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "630adf01fe54101d5214a17f_64f9e501427481970c043aa3", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "4", "complexity_b": "2", "assertive_a": "1", "assertive_b": "4", "feedback": "Response A does not correctly address the prompt."}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 55s "}}
