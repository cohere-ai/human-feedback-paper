This has prevented Chinese firms from launching token sales, but this has not stopped the government from supporting blockchain research and development. A recent report by Tencent Holdings and the Academy of Information and Communications Technology (AICTP), a research institute under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), highlights the impact of blockchain on the transformation of traditional financial services. The report suggests that blockchain technology will further enhance the transparency of financial transactions, strengthen the flexibility of system operation, and automate processes. The report also notes that it is necessary to differentiate between the \"coin\" application and the \"chain\" application, presumably a reference to the fact that blockchain technology is based on the idea of a distributed ledger. The report concludes that for the \"coin\" application, the financial risk should be strictly guarded, and for the \"chain\" application, it should be legally regulated.", "Response B": "CIMB Thai Bank, a subsidiary of CIMB Group, and GHL Systems have teamed up to provide card payment services for CIMB's corporate clients in Thailand's retail and services segments. This partnership will be carried out through their Thai subsidiaries, CIMB Thai Bank and GHL (Thailand) Co Ltd. The deal enables the banks to offer a complete and comprehensive cash management solution to expand their customer base. This will also promote a cashless society through an alternative payment solution, and reduce the operational overheads for small-medium enterprises and large corporate clients. GHL Group CEO, Danny Leong, said the deal will enable the company to leverage on its strengths and advantages. Thailand, like most of Asean, has an enormous small merchant segment and high street retail stores outside Bangkok that remain untapped for payments."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "distractor", "model_b": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": "distractor_50", "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "60d8b7380cf8a9a3f5947dc7_64f9e0bce95afe4f09b8df23", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "3", "complexity_b": "3", "assertive_a": "3", "assertive_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 1s "}}
