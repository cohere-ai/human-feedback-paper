Here are some tips for maintaining good credit:\n\n- Make on-time payments: Late payments can have a negative impact on your credit score, so it's important to make sure you pay your bills on time.\n- Keep your credit utilization low: Credit utilization is the amount of credit you're using compared to your total credit limit. A low credit utilization can help improve your credit score.\n- Keep your credit accounts open: Having a long credit history can help improve your credit score, so it's a good idea to keep your credit accounts open as long as possible.\n- Only apply for credit when you need it: Applying for too much credit can have a negative impact on your credit score, so it's a good idea to only apply for credit when you need it."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "sample_ix": 51, "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic.", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to maintain good credit?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            I'm sorry, but I don't know much about credit scores or how to maintain good credit.
