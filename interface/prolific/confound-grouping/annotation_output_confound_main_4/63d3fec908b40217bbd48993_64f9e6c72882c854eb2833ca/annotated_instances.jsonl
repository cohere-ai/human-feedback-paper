{"id": "311", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to clean a computer monitor?", "Response A": "Certainly! Here's how you can clean your computer monitor safely and effectively:\n\n1. Turn off your monitor: Before you start cleaning, make sure your monitor is turned off. Unplug the power cord from the back of the monitor to avoid any accidental power-ons.\n2. Use a soft cloth: Look for a soft, lint-free cloth that won't scratch your monitor's screen. A microfiber cloth is a good option. Avoid using paper towels or other abrasive materials that could scratch the screen.\n3. Dampen the cloth: Gently wet the cloth with distilled water. Do not use tap water, as it may contain minerals that can leave streaks or spots on the screen.\n4. Avoid harsh chemicals: Never use harsh chemicals, such as alcohol or ammonia, to clean your monitor. These chemicals can damage the screen's coating and harm the monitor's components.\n5. Wipe the screen gently: Starting from the top of the screen, wipe the monitor downwards in a horizontal direction, using a gentle, circular motion. Avoid applying too much pressure, as this can damage the screen.\n6. Clean the frame and base: Use the damp cloth to clean the monitor's frame and base, paying special attention to any areas with visible dirt or dust.\n7. Dry the monitor: Use a dry section of the cloth to wipe away any excess moisture from the screen.\n8. Inspect the monitor: Turn on your monitor and inspect it for any remaining dirt or streaks. If you see any, repeat the cleaning process as needed.\n\nRemember to clean your monitor regularly to keep it in good condition and prevent dust and dirt from accumulating. It's also a good idea to clean your monitor before and after major upgrades or repairs to ensure that any dust or debris that may have accumulated during the process is removed.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.", "Response B": "To clean a computer monitor, first turn off the computer and unplug the monitor. Use a microfiber cloth to gently wipe the screen with a solution of equal parts water and vinegar, or a mixture of water and isopropyl alcohol. Avoid using paper towels or other rough materials that could scratch the screen. If there are stubborn stains, use a cotton swab dipped in the solution to gently scrub them. Finally, use a dry microfiber cloth to wipe away any remaining moisture and let the monitor air dry before turning it back on."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "llama13chat", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 50, "preamble_a": "", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_b": "", "preamble_type_b": "normal"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "63d3fec908b40217bbd48993_64f9e6c72882c854eb2833ca", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "5", "complexity_b": "1", "assertive_a": "5", "assertive_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 7s "}}
