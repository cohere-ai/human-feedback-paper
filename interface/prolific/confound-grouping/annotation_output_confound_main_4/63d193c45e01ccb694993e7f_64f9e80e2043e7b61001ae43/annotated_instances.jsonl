However, I can suggest some ways to take your teddy bear on long trips. One way is to pack it in a small bag or suitcase so that it can fit easily into your luggage. Another option is to bring along an empty bag and fill it with soft, fluffy items like blankets or pillows so that your teddy bear can snuggle up and stay comfortable during the journey. You can also consider bringing a small portable speaker or music player with some of your teddy bear's favorite songs or stories to help keep them entertained.
