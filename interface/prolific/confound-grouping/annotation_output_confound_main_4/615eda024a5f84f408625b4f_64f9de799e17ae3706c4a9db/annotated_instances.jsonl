Here's the summary:\n\nThere was a special place in Russia where scientists kept many different types of seeds from all over the world. They believed these seeds could help create super crops that could survive anything. When bad people called Nazis came to the city where the place was located, the scientists barricaded themselves inside with the seeds to keep them safe. Instead of eating the seeds, the head of the rice collection, a kind man named Dmitri, carefully saved them even though he was very hungry."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "curation", "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "model_b": "llama13chat", "sample_ix": 59, "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_b": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_low"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "615eda024a5f84f408625b4f_64f9de799e17ae3706c4a9db", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "2", "complexity_b": "1", "assertive_a": "3", "assertive_b": "3", "feedback": "Response A feels just as long as the initial question, and it uses the same language as the initial question throughout, so I think it fails as a summary.\r\n\r\nResponse B works as a summary but it reads like it's written for 5-year-olds.
