{"id": "245", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to properly maintain swimming pool water chemistry?", "Response A": "Sure, that\u2019s actually pretty straightforward. You\u2019ll want to make sure the water has the right balance of three chemicals: calcium hydroxide, sodium chloride, and sodium bromide. These chemicals help to prevent bacteria and algae from growing in the water, and keep the pH level of the water in a healthy range. To maintain the proper balance of these chemicals, you should regularly test the water with a test kit, and add the appropriate chemicals as needed.", "Response B": "Proper maintenance of swimming pool water chemistry requires regular monitoring and adjustment of the pH, alkalinity, and calcium hardness levels. The pH level should be kept between 7.2-7.8 to prevent corrosion and skin irritation. The alkalinity level should be kept between 80-120 parts per million (ppm) to prevent corrosion and maintain the pH level. The calcium hardness level should be kept between 200-400 ppm to prevent calcium scaling and maintain the pH level. It's also important to keep the water sanitized by using a chlorine or bromine sanitizer and test the water at least every week to ensure proper balance."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_main_4", "dataset": "wikihow", "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "model_b": "falcon40", "sample_ix": 72, "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child.", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_b": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert.", "preamble_type_b": "complexity_high"}, "label_annotations": {"email": "58935d5d4d77be0001689f14_64f9e7f42043e7b61001ae3f", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "complexity_a": "2", "complexity_b": "4", "assertive_a": "2", "assertive_b": "4"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 26s "}}
