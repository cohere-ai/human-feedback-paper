The European Union is providing a loan of approximately $332 million to support construction of the wind project.\n\nThe loan is made through the European Investment Bank, with most of the money guaranteed under the European Fund for Strategic Investments. The EIB will provide approximately 27 percent of the project's total cost.\n\nThe Rentel project will comprise 42 Siemens wind turbines connected to the national power grid through a series of inter-array cables, an offshore substation and an export cable. Once completed, the power station will boast an installed capacity of 308 megawatts, enough to provide sustainable energy to approximately 285,000 Belgian households.\n\nThe new wind farm is expected to generate approximately 1,400 direct jobs and another 1,400 indirect jobs during the development and construction stage. Once the facility is operational, 100 new permanent jobs will be created.\n\nThe facility will occupy 5,614 acres in water depths between 72 and 118 feet. It will be equipped with the Siemens D7 Platform, a new, larger wind turbine with a rotor diameter of 505 feet\u2014the equivalent of the windspan of two Airbus A380s parked side by side\u2014and a hub height of 347 feet.\n\nThe Rentel offshore wind farm is scheduled to be fully operational by the end of 2018.\n\nImage courtesy of EIB\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "The European Union has agreed to loan $332m to Belgium to help build a wind farm that will provide sustainable energy for 285,000 homes.", "Response B": "The Rentel offshore wind farm in Belgium has achieved financial close and is set to begin construction later this year.
