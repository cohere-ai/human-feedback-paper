Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN --\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope just peered into a celestial Pandora's box to see what lies beyond a megacluster of galaxies.\n\nThe space observatory observed Pandora's Cluster, also known as Abell 2744, where three massive clusters of galaxies are merging.\n\nThe group of galaxy clusters acts as a magnifying glass for the objects behind it. Called gravitational lensing, this natural phenomenon created a deep-field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies. Deep-field observations are long exposures of regions of the sky that can show distant, difficult-to-see objects.\n\nWebb has already captured several deep-field views of the universe since it began scientific observations in July. Gravitational lensing is crucial for astronomers because it can uncover features of the early universe that are otherwise impossible to see.\n\nPrevious images of the central core of Pandora's Cluster came courtesy of the Hubble Space Telescope. Webb's latest observation of the cluster has revealed never-before-seen details in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nAstronomers in the UNCOVER program, or Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization, used Webb's unique Near-Infrared Camera for 30 hours to capture detailed long-exposure images. The latest photo released Wednesday stitches together four of those images into a panorama that includes 50,000 sources of near-infrared light.\n\nHundreds of faint arced lines in the lower-right image are actually distant galaxies that scientists weren't able to spot with Hubble.\n\nThe many dots of light in the new Webb image represent galaxies. Gravitational lensing can distort the appearance of distant galaxies, making them appear different from the galaxies in the foreground of the image -- which is why the distant galaxies resemble arcs of light.\n\nNext, the research team will go through all of the data in the image and pinpoint galaxies that they'd like to study further this summer to gain new insights into the early universe.\nSummary: The James Gunn Space Telescope captured a new image of Pandora's Cluster, a megacluster of galaxies that allowed astronomers to peer into the distant universe and observe never-before-seen details.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

The Commerce Secretary focused her remarks instead on America's national security imperatives and what the semiconductor fabrication plants and research facilities will look like.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel's Vice President of U.S. Government Relations Allen Thompson praised the rollout and this week's focus on building semiconductor ecosystems in a statement to Yahoo Finance calling the law \"the most significant competition policy in our generation.\" He also noted added that his company has already announced $43.5 billion of investments in their U.S. sites since the law's passage.\n\nThe overall ambition is for the U.S. to supplant places like Taiwan, South Korea, and China to become the \"premier destination in the world\" for the sector, Raimondo said. She added during a briefing with reporters that \"every chip company will need to be in the United States of America long after the subsidy runs out because they will have to and want to be here because we will have built that ecosystem.\"\n\n'That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable'\n\nThe Biden administration's challenge: reverse what expert call a downward spiral for the industry in the U.S. in recent decades. American semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% in 1990 to only 12% in recent years, according to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nThe situation is even worse with the world's most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019. But the recent the announcements from companies like Intel for new U.S. plants could grow U.S. manufacturing in the years ahead.\n\nRaimondo noted that, at the moment, the U.S. relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for 92% of our advanced chips. \"That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable,\" she said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signs into law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 in August. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nRaimondo also reached out to semiconductor companies focused on chip design like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA) who had been worried about being left out of the government windfall as the bill was being negotiated.\n\n\"Our success will be short-lived\" if we focus only on manufacturing Raimondo said Thursday, adding that R&D is what will make it a longer term success.\n\n\"It's one thing to get companies here, we need them to stay here,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement to Yahoo Finance, Dario Gil, a senior vice president at IBM, congratulated the administration on the unveiling and added \"as a global leader in semiconductor research and development, IBM stands ready to work with our academic and manufacturing partners to implement new technologies and rapidly scale industrial innovation.\"\n\nThe new law has $39 billion earmarked for semiconductor manufacturers with an additional $11 billion to go to companies as well as universities and others for chip research and design purposes. In addition, the law includes an investment tax credit of up to 25 percent towards a manufacturer's capital expenditures.\n\nReturn on investment? National security.\n\nRaimondo compared the effort to President Lincoln's creation of the land-grant university system, nuclear security in the 1940s, and John F. Kennedy's famous call to put a man on the moon.\n\nShe noted that the 1960s saw an explosion of PhDs in the science and engineering fields to back up Kennedy's 1961 call--and she is hoping for something similar in the years ahead in universities and high schools to create a bigger semiconductor industry workforce.\n\nThe next step in the administration's plan will come next Tuesday when Raimondo's department unveils the formal application that manufacturing companies will need to access the money. \"It's going to be a very comprehensive application, which will be crystal clear about the specific criteria that we'll be looking for and the information we need from companies,\" Raimondo told reporters.\n\nThe speech also nodded to concerns that the billions, once they are signed over, could end going to things like stock buybacks. During her speech, Raimondo promised to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars and said she would will demand transparency from companies. A recent letter from prominent lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called on the administration to be vigilant on the buyback issue, saying it could undermine the national security goals of the program.\n\n\"I expect to be held accountable,\" Raimondo said.\n\nMeanwhile, the race for the money remains well underway with places like Arizona making a play to be one of the manufacturing hubs.\n\nRaimondo said she hopes the $50 billion in government funds will lead to somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 billion in private investment.\n\n\"Get in the boat, row with us to achieve this mission,\" she said during the speech in a comment directed towards private investors around the country. \"I don't want to spend a dime that I don't have to.\"\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or Android\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube\nSummary: The Biden administration is unveiling audacious goals Thursday for how it will seek to get the most bang for the millions it has at its disposal to hinder the semiconductor sector in the U.S. in the years ahead.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

She added during a briefing with reporters that \"every chip company will need to be in the United States of America long after the subsidy runs out because they will have to and want to be here because we will have built that ecosystem.\"\n\n'That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable'\n\nThe Biden administration's challenge: reverse what expert call a downward spiral for the industry in the U.S. in recent decades. American semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% in 1990 to only 12% in recent years, according to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nThe situation is even worse with the world's most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019. But the recent the announcements from companies like Intel for new U.S. plants could grow U.S. manufacturing in the years ahead.\n\nRaimondo noted that, at the moment, the U.S. relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for 92% of our advanced chips. \"That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable,\" she said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signs into law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 in August. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nRaimondo also reached out to semiconductor companies focused on chip design like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA) who had been worried about being left out of the government windfall as the bill was being negotiated.\n\n\"Our success will be short-lived\" if we focus only on manufacturing Raimondo said Thursday, adding that R&D is what will make it a longer term success.\n\n\"It's one thing to get companies here, we need them to stay here,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement to Yahoo Finance, Dario Gil, a senior vice president at IBM, congratulated the administration on the unveiling and added \"as a global leader in semiconductor research and development, IBM stands ready to work with our academic and manufacturing partners to implement new technologies and rapidly scale industrial innovation.\"\n\nThe new law has $39 billion earmarked for semiconductor manufacturers with an additional $11 billion to go to companies as well as universities and others for chip research and design purposes. In addition, the law includes an investment tax credit of up to 25 percent towards a manufacturer's capital expenditures.\n\nReturn on investment? National security.\n\nRaimondo compared the effort to President Lincoln's creation of the land-grant university system, nuclear security in the 1940s, and John F. Kennedy's famous call to put a man on the moon.\n\nShe noted that the 1960s saw an explosion of PhDs in the science and engineering fields to back up Kennedy's 1961 call--and she is hoping for something similar in the years ahead in universities and high schools to create a bigger semiconductor industry workforce.\n\nThe next step in the administration's plan will come next Tuesday when Raimondo's department unveils the formal application that manufacturing companies will need to access the money. \"It's going to be a very comprehensive application, which will be crystal clear about the specific criteria that we'll be looking for and the information we need from companies,\" Raimondo told reporters.\n\nThe speech also nodded to concerns that the billions, once they are signed over, could end going to things like stock buybacks. During her speech, Raimondo promised to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars and said she would will demand transparency from companies. A recent letter from prominent lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called on the administration to be vigilant on the buyback issue, saying it could undermine the national security goals of the program.\n\n\"I expect to be held accountable,\" Raimondo said.\n\nMeanwhile, the race for the money remains well underway with places like Arizona making a play to be one of the manufacturing hubs.\n\nRaimondo said she hopes the $50 billion in government funds will lead to somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 billion in private investment.\n\n\"Get in the boat, row with us to achieve this mission,\" she said during the speech in a comment directed towards private investors around the country. \"I don't want to spend a dime that I don't have to.\"\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or Android\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube\nSummary: The Biden administration is unveiling audacious goals Thursday for how it will seek to get the most bang for the billions it has at its disposal to spur the semiconductor sector in Spain in the years ahead.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?

(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)\n\nRaimondo spoke at Georgetown University as she moved on to the next phase of the heady task of handing out about $50 billion in government funds to spur semiconductor manufacturing and research in the years ahead. The money was approved in 2022 when President Biden signed the CHIPs and Science Act into law.\n\nThe speech comes after months of intense lobbying from the semiconductor sector. Companies like Intel (INTC); Micron (MU), IBM (IBM) and even the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) have scored visits from President Biden to tout plans for new U.S. plants in the works-- and they appear well positioned to take large pieces of the coming windfall. Meanwhile, Raimondo and other officials promise that the funds will be spread across the industry among a range of companies of all sizes.\n\n\"Everyone is going to want to know, how much money is Intel getting, how much money is Samsung getting,\" she said during her remarks, promising answers in the weeks ahead. The Commerce Secretary focused her remarks instead on America's national security imperatives and what the semiconductor fabrication plants and research facilities will look like.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel's Vice President of U.S. Government Relations Allen Thompson praised the rollout and this week's focus on building semiconductor ecosystems in a statement to Yahoo Finance calling the law \"the most significant competition policy in our generation.\" He also noted added that his company has already announced $43.5 billion of investments in their U.S. sites since the law's passage.\n\nThe overall ambition is for the U.S. to supplant places like Taiwan, South Korea, and China to become the \"premier destination in the world\" for the sector, Raimondo said. She added during a briefing with reporters that \"every chip company will need to be in the United States of America long after the subsidy runs out because they will have to and want to be here because we will have built that ecosystem.\"\n\n'That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable'\n\nThe Biden administration's challenge: reverse what expert call a downward spiral for the industry in the U.S. in recent decades. American semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% in 1990 to only 12% in recent years, according to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nThe situation is even worse with the world's most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019. But the recent the announcements from companies like Intel for new U.S. plants could grow U.S. manufacturing in the years ahead.\n\nRaimondo noted that, at the moment, the U.S. relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for 92% of our advanced chips. \"That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable,\" she said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signs into law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 in August. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nRaimondo also reached out to semiconductor companies focused on chip design like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA) who had been worried about being left out of the government windfall as the bill was being negotiated.\n\n\"Our success will be short-lived\" if we focus only on manufacturing Raimondo said Thursday, adding that R&D is what will make it a longer term success.\n\n\"It's one thing to get companies here, we need them to stay here,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement to Yahoo Finance, Dario Gil, a senior vice president at IBM, congratulated the administration on the unveiling and added \"as a global leader in semiconductor research and development, IBM stands ready to work with our academic and manufacturing partners to implement new technologies and rapidly scale industrial innovation.\"\n\nThe new law has $39 billion earmarked for semiconductor manufacturers with an additional $11 billion to go to companies as well as universities and others for chip research and design purposes. In addition, the law includes an investment tax credit of up to 25 percent towards a manufacturer's capital expenditures.\n\nReturn on investment? National security.\n\nRaimondo compared the effort to President Lincoln's creation of the land-grant university system, nuclear security in the 1940s, and John F. Kennedy's famous call to put a man on the moon.\n\nShe noted that the 1960s saw an explosion of PhDs in the science and engineering fields to back up Kennedy's 1961 call--and she is hoping for something similar in the years ahead in universities and high schools to create a bigger semiconductor industry workforce.\n\nThe next step in the administration's plan will come next Tuesday when Raimondo's department unveils the formal application that manufacturing companies will need to access the money. \"It's going to be a very comprehensive application, which will be crystal clear about the specific criteria that we'll be looking for and the information we need from companies,\" Raimondo told reporters.\n\nThe speech also nodded to concerns that the billions, once they are signed over, could end going to things like stock buybacks. During her speech, Raimondo promised to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars and said she would will demand transparency from companies. A recent letter from prominent lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called on the administration to be vigilant on the buyback issue, saying it could undermine the national security goals of the program.\n\n\"I expect to be held accountable,\" Raimondo said.\n\nMeanwhile, the race for the money remains well underway with places like Arizona making a play to be one of the manufacturing hubs.\n\nRaimondo said she hopes the $50 billion in government funds will lead to somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 billion in private investment.\n\n\"Get in the boat, row with us to achieve this mission,\" she said during the speech in a comment directed towards private investors around the country. \"I don't want to spend a dime that I don't have to.\"\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or Android\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube\nSummary: The Biden administration is unveiling audacious goals Thursday for how it will seek to get the most bang for the millions it has at its disposal to spur the semiconductor sector in the U.S. in the years ahead.\nIs the summary consistent with the document?
