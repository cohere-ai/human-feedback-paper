It depends on how much weight you want to lose, and how quickly.  If you are trying to lose just a few pounds, you might want to try cutting out sugary drinks and foods like candy and cake.

You might also want to consider taking up a new hobby that will help you burn calories, such as running, swimming, or wrestling."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_validation_1", "dataset": "wikihow", "sample_ix": 103, "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_a": ""}, "label_annotations": {"email": "tom_44", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "repetition_a": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 53s "}}
