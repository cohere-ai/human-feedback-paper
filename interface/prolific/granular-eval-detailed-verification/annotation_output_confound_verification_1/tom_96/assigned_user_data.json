{"146": {"id": "146", "text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to make pumpkin pancakes?", "Response A": "Sure, I can try to help you with that. I think you'll need some pumpkin puree, eggs, milk, flour, sugar, baking powder, and a few other ingredients. You'll also need a griddle or a frying pan, and some butter or oil to cook the pancakes in.\n\nTo make the pancakes, you'll first need to mix together the dry ingredients, then add the wet ingredients and mix until the batter is smooth. Then, you'll need to heat up the griddle or frying pan over medium heat, and add a little butter or oil to the pan. Once the butter or oil is hot, you can add the batter to the pan in 1/4 cup increments, and cook the pancakes for a few minutes on each side until they are golden brown and cooked through.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_validation_1", "dataset": "wikihow", "sample_ix": 109, "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic."}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to make pumpkin pancakes?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure, I can try to help you with that.
