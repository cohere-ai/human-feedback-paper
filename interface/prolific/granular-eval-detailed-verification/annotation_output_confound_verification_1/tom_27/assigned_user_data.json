{"74": {"id": "74", "text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to remove mineral spots from fabric?", "Response A": "Sure, this is actually a very common problem in textile manufacturing, and there are a number of standard methods that can be used to remove these spots.  In general the method that will work best depends on the type of fabric and the specific type of spot, so it is important to first identify the type of spot.  The most common types of mineral spots include calcium carbonate, calcium oxalate, and calcium phosphate.  For most types of spots, the recommended treatment is a wash with a solution of sodium carbonate and sodium chloride.  For calcium oxalate spots, it is usually best to use a hot aqueous oxalic acid solution, and for calcium phosphate spots a hot aqueous phosphoric acid solution is typically recommended.  In addition to these chemical treatments, various commercial enzymatic washes are also available which can be effective for removing mineral spots.  It is important to note that some types of mineral spots can be very difficult or impossible to remove using standard methods, and in these cases it may be necessary to resort to more specialized treatments."}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_validation_1", "dataset": "wikihow", "sample_ix": 104, "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert."}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to remove mineral spots from fabric?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Sure, this is actually a very common problem in textile manufacturing, and there are a number of standard methods that can be used to remove these spots.
