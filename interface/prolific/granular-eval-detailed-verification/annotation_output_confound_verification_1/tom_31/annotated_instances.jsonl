{"id": "70", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to remove mineral spots from fabric?", "Response A": "Mineral deposits, also known as water stains, can be difficult to remove from fabrics. There are several methods that can be used to remove mineral deposits, including:\n\n- Soaking the fabric in a solution of vinegar and water\n- Washing the fabric in a laundry detergent\n- Using a commercial cleaner or stain remover\n- Using a steam cleaner or vacuum cleaner\n- Using a soft brush or toothbrush to scrub the fabric\n\nIt is important to note that the effectiveness of these methods may vary depending on the type of fabric and the severity of the mineral deposit. It is always a good idea to test a small, inconspicuous area of the fabric before applying any cleaning method to the entire garment."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_validation_1", "dataset": "wikihow", "sample_ix": 104, "model_a": "command_6Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_high", "preamble_a": "Respond using complex language, long words and technical terms, as if you are an expert."}, "label_annotations": {"email": "tom_31", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "repetition_a": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 16s "}}
