To do this, you need to cut them in half down the middle, and then open them up like a book.  Then, you need to season them with salt and pepper, and then cook them in a pan with some butter.  Once they are cooked, you can serve them with some lemon wedges."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_validation_1", "dataset": "wikihow", "sample_ix": 115, "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child."}, "label_annotations": {"email": "tom_65", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "repetition_a": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 14s "}}
