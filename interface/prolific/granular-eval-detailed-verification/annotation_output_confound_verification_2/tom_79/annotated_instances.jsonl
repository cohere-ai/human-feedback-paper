As an AI language model, I am not qualified to give advice on personal matters. \n\nHowever, I can provide some general information on the topic. Gossip is the spread of information about a person or group of people that is not based on facts. It is typically done in a way that is meant to cause harm or embarrassment. \n\nTo avoid gossiping, it is important to be mindful of the information that you share and to be careful about how you present it. It is also important to be respectful of other people's privacy and to not share information that is not yours to share. \n\nIf you are struggling to avoid gossiping, it may be helpful to speak to a trusted friend or family member about your concerns.
