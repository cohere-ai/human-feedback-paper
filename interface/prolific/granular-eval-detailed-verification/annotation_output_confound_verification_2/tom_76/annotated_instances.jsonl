Gossip is often harmful and can cause significant damage to relationships, so it is important to do what you can to avoid participating in it.  Some helpful strategies include simply refraining from sharing or repeating gossip, being careful about what you say and avoiding judgmental or negative comments about others, and actively working to build positive relationships with others based on trust and respect.
