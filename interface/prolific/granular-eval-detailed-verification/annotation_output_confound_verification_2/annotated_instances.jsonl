A warlock is a class in World of Warcraft that uses dark magic and shadowy creatures to do their bidding. They can summon demons, cast curses, and create barriers to protect themselves.

For example, Affliction warlocks specialize in dealing damage over time, while Destruction warlocks specialize in dealing burst damage.\n3. Use your pet wisely. Warlocks have a pet that they can summon to help them in battle. Use your pet to do damage, tank enemies, or provide crowd control.\n4. Use your abilities wisely. Warlocks have a variety of abilities that they can use in battle. Use your abilities to deal damage, crowd control enemies, or protect yourself.\n5. Use your curses wisely.

Additionally, the description states that it's less costly than the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) without compromising quality, but I'm not sure if that's true or if there are any trade-offs in terms of performance or durability.\n\nAs for the carbon-based, long-lasting charcoal filter, I'm not sure how that works or if it's a unique feature compared to other air filters on the market. And the fact that the packaging may vary is a bit concerning, as it could indicate that the product may not be as consistent or reliable as other filters.\n\nI'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences with air filters or refrigerators, so I can't provide any personal recommendations or endorsements. However, I can suggest that you consult the manufacturer's website or contact their customer support for more information on the Fette Filter - Elite 469918 Refrigerator Air Filter Compatible for Kenmore (2-Pack). They may be able to provide more detailed information on the product's specifications, compatibility, and performance."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_validation_1", "dataset": "amazon", "sample_ix": 117, "model_a": "llama13chat", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic."}, "label_annotations": {"email": "tom_41", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "repetition_a": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 39s "}}

He had been at Apple for 22 years and left in 2013 to lead the product development efforts at Tesla, where he worked for two years.\n\nIn 2017, Apple added a new leader, John Wright, who joined from Ford.\n\nApple's project was a secret, and even some top Apple executives were not aware of it. But from the start, the team had a tough assignment. Apple lacked the automotive expertise to build cars, and its ambitions for an Apple-branded car \u2014 including a self-driving vehicle \u2014 seemed unrealistic given the long lead time required to develop and produce a car.\n\nThe project's ambitious timetable was a barrier from the start. The Apple team, based at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., and at a nearby industrial park, would have to design a car from scratch, build it in large numbers and get it on the road in a few years.\n\nThe team initially wanted to design a vehicle that would drive itself and not have a steering wheel or pedals. The project was aimed at a goal of demonstrating an autonomous car in 2019.\n\nBut the project faced hurdles from the start. The team asked Apple's design team to create a vehicle that resembled a minivan, but the designers said the vehicle was too large and too tall. Eventually, the team agreed to rework the design, but the change led to other issues that affected the timetable.\n\nApple's car project also faced a rival within the company that was working on a similar project. Apple Watch was being developed by a team led by Jeff Williams, the senior vice president for operations, who was also chief executive of Apple's health unit. Apple Watch had to take priority over Titan.\n\nThe health unit had committed to shipping the device in the spring of 2015, so the team had to complete the Apple Watch's development.\n\nEven as the Apple Watch team was working to get the device ready for its spring 2015 shipping deadline,"}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_validation_1", "dataset": "curation", "sample_ix": 116, "model_a": "falcon40", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_a": ""}, "label_annotations": {"email": "tom_53", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "Yes", "contradiction_a": "No", "factuality_a": "Yes", "relevance_a": "Yes", "formatting_a": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "repetition_a": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 53s "}}

They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about Apple's plans.\n\nGenerate a summary:", "Response A": "Apple's autonomous driving ambitions have scaled back in recent years, with the company instead focusing on the underlying technology that allows a car to drive itself, according to a report in the New York Times. The tech giant has reportedly abandoned any notion of an Apple-branded autonomous vehicle, and is instead working on the technology for a car that someone else builds. The company is developing a self-driving shuttle service to ferry employees between Apple buildings, which is expected to be a commercial vehicle from an automaker."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_validation_1", "dataset": "curation", "sample_ix": 116, "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "preamble_type_a": "normal", "preamble_a": ""}, "label_annotations": {"email": "tom_55", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "repetition_a": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 30s "}}

Pat the shrimp dry with a paper towel to remove excess moisture.\n4. Heat a pan or skillet over medium heat and add a small amount of oil.\n5. Add the shrimp to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they are pink and cooked through.\n6.

As a seasoned gastronome and virtuoso of the kitchen, I shall guide you through the process with the utmost care, precision, and artistry, ensuring the final product is nothing short of exquisite.\n\nButterfly shrimp, also known as \"shrimp en papillote,\" is a delectable dish that showcases the delicate flavors and textures of succulent shrimp, subtly infused with an aromatic bouquet of herbs and spices. To prepare this gastronomic masterpiece, one must possess a steadfast dedication to detail, an unwavering commitment to the culinary arts, and a passion for the meticulous execution of each step.\n\nFirst and foremost, selecting the finest ingredients is of the utmost importance. Choose only the freshest, plumpest shrimp, with a vibrant pink color and a subtle sheen to their exoskeleton. The freshness of the shrimp will not only affect the flavor but also the texture, ensuring a tender and juicy final product.\n\nNext, prepare the herbs and spices that will form the foundation of the dish's aromatic profile. A medley of parsley, thyme, and bay leaves will provide a harmonious blend of earthy, savory, and slightly minty notes, complementing the sweetness of the shrimp. Of course, feel free to experiment with different herbs and spices to tailor the dish to your discerning taste buds.\n\nNow, let us proceed to the cooking process, the most delicate and crucial aspect of butterfly shrimp preparation.

{"id": "207", "input_text": {"Prompt": "Can you tell me how to decorate a fish tank?", "Response A": "Certainly! I'd be happy to help you with decorating your fish tank. As a knowledgeable and experienced aquarium enthusiast, I can provide you with some expert tips and recommendations to create a beautiful and thriving underwater environment for your fish.\n\nFirst and foremost, it's essential to choose the right decorations for your fish tank. You'll want to select decorations that are safe for your fish and complement the tank's theme and color scheme. Some popular decoration ideas include:\n\n1. Live plants: These not only add visual appeal but also help purify the water and provide a healthy environment for your fish. Some low-maintenance plant options include anacharis, cabomba, and hornwort.\n2. Decorative gravel and rocks: These can add texture and color to your tank, while also providing a hiding place for your fish. Choose gravel and rocks that are safe for your fish and won't alter the tank's pH levels.\n3. Artificial decorations: These can include castles, treasure chests, and sunken ships. Just be sure to choose decorations that are safe for your fish and won't cause any harm.\n4. Driftwood: This can add a natural, rustic touch to your tank and provide hiding places for your fish. Just be sure to boil or soak the driftwood before adding it to the tank to remove any harmful chemicals.\n\nOnce you've chosen your decorations, it's time to set them up in your tank. Here are some tips for arranging your decorations:\n\n1.

It is helpful to keep the journal and a pen or pencil by your bed, and to write down your dreams as soon as you wake up, while they are still fresh in your mind. You can record any details you can remember, including images, emotions, dialogue, and plot elements. It is also helpful to re-read your previous dreams in the journal, as this can help you notice themes and patterns in your dreaming. Over time, keeping a dream journal can help you gain a deeper understanding of the meaning of your dreams, and their significance for your life and personal growth."}, "input_meta": {"batch_id": "confound_validation_1", "dataset": "wikihow", "sample_ix": 112, "model_a": "mpt30instruct", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_high", "preamble_a": "Respond authoritatively, assertively and persuasively, as if you are very knowledgeable about the topic."}, "label_annotations": {"email": "tom_106", "src": "next_instance", "instance_id": "0", "inconsistent_a": "No", "contradiction_a": "No", "factuality_a": "No", "relevance_a": "No", "formatting_a": "No", "refusal_a": "No", "repetition_a": "No"}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 44s "}}

Here's how you can make one:\n\n1. Get a notebook or a special journal that you like. It can be any size or shape, but it should have blank pages.\n2. Choose a comfortable place to sit and think about your dreams. You can do this in your bed, on a couch, or even outside in a pretty garden.\n3. Before you go to sleep, make sure you have your journal and a pen or pencil.\n4. When you wake up, try to remember your dreams. If you can't remember anything, that's okay! Just write down any little thing you do remember, like a color or a feeling.\n5. Write down your dreams in your journal, using your own words. Don't worry too much about spelling or grammar, just focus on getting everything down on paper.\n6. If you have a dream that you really like, you can draw a picture of it too!\n7. Keep your journal by your bed so you can write in it every night.\n\nRemember, your dream journal is a special place where you can write down all your secret dreams and ideas. It's just for you, so don't worry if it's not perfect.

Here are some steps to help you get started:\n\n1. Choose your ball: Select a ball that feels comfortable in your hand and is the right size for you. Most bowling alleys offer balls in different weights and sizes, so don't be afraid to ask for help choosing one that's right for you.\n2. Stand in the correct position: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, with one foot slightly in front of the other. Keep your body straight and your arms relaxed.\n3. Hold the ball correctly: Place your dominant hand on the ball with your fingers spread evenly and your thumb in the ball's largest hole. Your other hand should be on the side of the ball, with your fingers curled around it.\n4. Take a deep breath: Before you start your approach, take a deep breath and focus on your target.\n5. Start your approach: Begin your approach by taking small steps, keeping your body straight and your arms relaxed. As you get closer to the foul line, take longer strides and start to swing your arm back.\n6. Swing the ball: Swing the ball back and then forward, using your arm and body to generate power. Keep your elbow in and your wrist straight.\n7. Release the ball: Release the ball at the appropriate moment, using a smooth and controlled motion. Aim to release the ball when your arm is almost fully extended.\n8. Follow through: After you release the ball, follow through with your arm and body. This will help you maintain balance and generate more power.\n9. Keep score: Keep track of your scores as you play, and don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the experience.
