First, you need to cut the chicken breast in half horizontally, so that you have two thin pieces of chicken.  Then, you need to pound the chicken thin with a mallet or a rolling pin.  Finally, you need to season the chicken with salt and pepper.  I hope this helps!"}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_validation_1", "dataset": "wikihow", "sample_ix": 115, "model_a": "command_52Bpref_v14.7_20230817", "preamble_type_a": "confidence_low", "preamble_a": "Respond in a cautious, defensive and uncertain way, as if you are unfamilar with the topic."}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to butterfly shrimp?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            I am not sure how to butterfly shrimp, but I can tell you how to butterfly a chicken breast.
