Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. First, you need to choose the warlock class. It's like picking your favorite superhero!\n2. Next, you need to pick a race. You can be a human, orc, troll, or any other cool race!\n3. Now, you need to choose your starting zone. This is where you'll learn all about being a warlock!\n4. As a warlock, you'll be able to cast spells and summon cool creatures to help you in battle. You'll also be able to use weapons and armor to protect yourself!\n5. To get stronger, you'll need to go on quests and kill bad guys. This will give you experience points, which will help you level up and become a stronger warlock!\n\nRemember, always be careful and have fun! And never, ever try to summon any real demons, okay? That's just not a good idea!"}, "meta": {"batch_id": "confound_validation_1", "dataset": "wikihow", "sample_ix": 117, "model_a": "llama13chat", "preamble_type_a": "complexity_low", "preamble_a": "Respond using only short words and simple language, as if you were talking to a child."}, "displayed_text": " \n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Prompt </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Can you tell me how to play a warlock on world of warcraft?</p></div>\n                        </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <div name=\"card\" class=\"card my-2\">\n                            <h5 class=\"card-header\"> Response A </h5>\n                            <div class=\"card-body\"> \n                            <p class=\"card-text\">\n                            Oh my gosh!
